Modern mafia has its historical and sociological roots in the birth of American capitalism through the establishment of particular relationships between the American and Sicilian mafia. The methods and subtle ramifications of the mafia become instruments of terror and power: the same strategies, the same enforced silence. This is demonstrated by discoveries made by investigators both in Sicily and in the United States. A documentary collage made out of archive footage, sequences of films ranging from Salvatore Giuliano (1962) to Paisà (1946), and faithfully reconstructed facts from real-world news, recording the mafia\u0027s methods, crimes, collusions and high-ranking protections, also highlighting the links between the original island organization and Italian-American organized crime.

When Gordon is taking his girlfriend\u0027s picture in Hong Kong, several Caucasian thugs led by a Chinese man, Kogan, threaten her, so he beats them up. Elsewhere, Bernard Wong pays his workers extra money to continue digging his land after discovering human bones. The thugs are members of the Black Ninja Clan, whose dead are buried on Wong\u0027s site. One of their operatives strangles Gordon\u0027s girlfriend, believing she knows where Gordon has hidden the Golden Ninja statue that apparently gives him power and won\u0027t say, while another hires Ghost Ninja, a beautiful witch dressed in white to kill Wong, his daughter Fanny, her husband George, and her son, Bobo, for three million dollars. Fanny is frightened by a cat in the house upon move-in, and the Black Ninja leader keeps swinging her sword to hallucinate frogs jumping to their deaths out of her refrigerator and her soup ladle turning into a flying snake (strung on a wire that is highly visible without pausing despite being a split-second shot). The witch keeps spooking Fanny and Bobo, who insists on riding his bike in the living room, but George doesn\u0027t believe either of them. Gordon (sitting in front of a poster of a strangled woman marked \"this could happen to you\" and another poster of a swimsuit model) responds to their complaints (in shot-reverse shot, as they\u0027re obviously not in the same film) and commands Magic Chan, a wizard with a magic mirror he has forgotten, and his obese sidekick, Firecracker, in the same manor, and frequently keeps in touch on the phone after his Caucasian operative living next door, Sara, is murdered by a zombie man. Sometimes he uses a black phone, but more often it is a Garfield phone (which the camera moves and music suggest is supposed to be funny). The Ghost Ninja is more interested in her own desires than killing the family, and masturbates to the couple\u0027s lovemaking before spiriting herself into Fanny\u0027s vagina (there is no full-frontal nudity) in order to lure George away from her, though she makes him physically ill, as she did to Bobo by stuffing his mouth full of handfuls of grass. The Ghost Ninja, once compelled by the Black Ninja leader, calls upon more women like dressed her, plus one impersonating Bobo\u0027s grandmother as a lure for him, and the zombie man, in an all-out assault against the family, while the two bumbling idiots (Firecracker and Magic Chan) are having a drinking contest, and Gordon, in a red ninja suit, who has been offing the Caucasian ninjas, prepares to confront Kogan, the Black Ninja leader. —Scott Andrew Hutchins \u003cscottandrewhutchins@yahoo.com\u003e","tokens":"Photography,Sculpture,Performance","title":"Diamond Ninja Force","total occurrences":"3"},"color":"rgb(145,143,124)","size":40.21052551269531},{"x":765.8416137695312,"y":-2099.318115234375,"id":"tt0213905","attributes":{"decade":"1990","color":"#baa79b","Component ID":"0","year":"1999","Degree":"1","country of origin":"Argentina","description":"The portrait of a man and his attempts to make things up with life after losing his job.","tokens":"Painting","title":"Crane World","total occurrences":"1"},"color":"rgb(84,80,68)","size":40.0},{"x":-1623.7919921875,"y":1270.1553955078125,"id":"tt0061352","attributes":{"decade":"1960","color":"#8b6b57","Component ID":"0","year":"1967","Degree":"1","country of origin":"Romania","description":"A gang of thieves try to smuggle a valuable stolen painting out of the country.","tokens":"Painting","title":"Amprenta","total occurrences":"1"},"color":"rgb(216,220,211)","size":40.0},{"x":-31.018001556396484,"y":1618.734375,"id":"tt0087607","attributes":{"decade":"1980","color":"#616c61","Component ID":"0","year":"1985","Degree":"1","country of origin":"Italy","description":"Malaya 1938.

To make money, the team\u0027s unknown owner makes its manager, Joe McGrath, do cheesy publicity much to the players\u0027 chagrin. Rumors abound among the players that if the local mill closes, the team will fold. Just before the official announcement is made, the team\u0027s aging player/coach, Reggie Dunlop, does get wind that the mill is indeed closing and that this season will be the team\u0027s last. Beyond efforts to reconcile with his wife Francine, who loves Reggie but doesn\u0027t love his career, Reggie begins to focus on how to renew interest in the team for a possible sale as he knows if the team folds, his hockey career is over. Without telling anyone of his plan, he begins a rumor that the owner is negotiating a sale with a city in Florida. He also decides that \"goon\" hockey - most especially using the untapped talents of the recently acquired childlike but quietly menacing Hanson brothers - is the way to renew local interest. It works as the team begins to attract new fans, sell out games, sell out away games attended largely by their groupies, and win, which does fuel the rumor of a sale. The one team member who doesn\u0027t like this new style is Ned Braden, a college graduate who plays the game solely because he loves it. His hockey career is against the wishes of his tomboyish wife, Lily, who hates everything about Charlestown and being a hockey wife. Reggie\u0027s goal of winning the league championship and having the team sold takes a turn when he finally meets the team\u0027s owner and discovers the owner\u0027s motivations. Ned, with his own views of what is right and wrong in hockey, may come up with an unexpected way to achieve all their goals. —Huggo","tokens":"Create,Sculpture","title":"Slap Shot","total occurrences":"2"},"color":"rgb(237,227,182)","size":40.105262756347656},{"x":-940.6005249023438,"y":-586.8778686523438,"id":"tt0079123","attributes":{"decade":"1970","color":"#5a544d","Component ID":"0","year":"1979","Degree":"1","country of origin":"United Kingdom","description":"It\u0027s the mid-nineteenth century.

He is there to follow up on a letter addressed specifically to him from an anonymous source on Summerisle reporting that a twelve year old girl who lives on the island, Rowan Morrison, the daughter of May Morrison, has long been missing. The correspondence includes a photograph of Rowan. Upon his arrival on Summerisle, Howie finds that the locals are a seemingly simple minded lot who provide little information beyond the fact that they know of no Rowan Morrison and do not know the girl in the photo. Mrs. Morrison admits to having a daughter, seven year old Myrtle, but no Rowan. As Howie speaks to more and more people, he begins to believe that Rowan does or did live on the island, but that the locals are hiding their knowledge of her. He also begins to see that the locals all have pagan beliefs, their \"religion\" which centers on procreation as the source of life. That procreation does not necessarily need to be within marriage, and openly flaunts the act of sex, both in private and in public. These beliefs do not sit well against Howie\u0027s strict Christian morals, he who regularly attends church, prays, and accepts communion. Everything that happens on the island seems to be dictated by Lord Summerisle, whose ancestors bought the island generations ago. Howie begins to believe that Rowan was murdered, she a sacrifice by the islanders to their higher power to ensure a bountiful apple crop - the main crop of the island - which did not materialize last season. With May Day approaching, Howie not only tries to find out if Rowan was indeed murdered/sacrificed, which includes trying to locate her body, but if there will be another sacrifice on this important day within the cycle of life. —Huggo","tokens":"Photography,Sculpture","title":"The Wicker Man","total occurrences":"2"},"color":"rgb(237,227,182)","size":40.105262756347656},{"x":-474.3732604980469,"y":108.10824584960938,"id":"tt0050294","attributes":{"decade":"1950","color":"#7b3b32","Component ID":"0","year":"1957","Degree":"3","country of origin":"United States","description":"The calving of an Arctic iceberg releases a giant praying mantis, trapped in suspended animation since prehistoric times.

Long having retired, James Whale, arguably most famous for directing Frankenstein (1931) and Bride of Frankenstein (1935) among some other 1930s horror classics, has burned his bridges with the Hollywood community in that they have abandoned him, the possible exception being his continuing friendship with former lover David Lewis. James had been openly gay even during his working period and is in declining health. Having been recently released from a hospital where he was recuperating from a stroke, he left with some permanent health issues, the aftermath of the stroke. Much against the disapproval of his loyal longtime housekeeper Hanna, his health does not prevent him from toying with the handsome young men who may wander into his midst in his continuing homosexual desires, although Hanna is as much, if not more concerned about any of those young men taking advantage of him in his elderly and fragile state. The young man who catches his eye among the most recent is Clayton Boone, who Hanna had hired to do garden work around the property. Clay, an ex-marine from the proverbial \"wrong side of the tracks\", has no idea who James was or is before he starts this job. James and Clay soon begin a friendship of sorts. Clay is also unaware of James\u0027 homosexual orientation before such is confirmed by Hanna, an issue which threatens his masculinity, especially in light of the cracks showing in his casual sexual relationship with a slightly older and wiser diner waitress named Betty. Clay has to reconcile that threat against being in the company of someone whom he considers an interesting and once famous man. The friendship and his state of health related to the stroke lead James to reflect in a bittersweet vein on key points of his life, most notably serving in WWI, and as a result reveals his ulterior motives through the actions he takes toward Clay. —Huggo","tokens":"Painting,Sculpture","title":"Gods and Monsters","total occurrences":"2"},"color":"rgb(84,80,68)","size":40.105262756347656},{"x":-811.9024658203125,"y":-1481.1229248046875,"id":"tt0069097","attributes":{"decade":"1970","color":"#5a544d","Component ID":"0","year":"1972","Degree":"3","country of origin":"United States","description":"A mild mannered film critic is dumped by his wife and his ego is crushed.

The film is inspired by Michael Lesy\u0027s book of the same name, which published in 1973. Lesy discovered a striking archive of black and white photographs in the town of Black River Falls, dating from the 1890s and married a selection of these images to extracts from the town\u0027s newspaper from the same decade. The effect was surprising and disturbing. The town of Black River Falls seems gripped by some peculiar malaise, and the weekly news is dominated by bizarre tales of madness, eccentricity, and violence amongst the local population. Suicide and murder are commonplace. People in the town are haunted by ghosts, possessed by demons, and terrorized by teenage outlaws and arsonists. Like the book, the film is constructed entirely from authentic news reports from the Black River Falls\u0027 newspaper, with occasional excerpts from the records of the nearby Mendota Asylum for the Insane. The film also makes use of the haunting black and white photographs taken by the resident portrait photographer of Black River Falls at the end of the nineteenth century. Contemporary color documentary footage of the town today, is also included at the end of each section of the film that take place over the course of four seasons. —MAR","tokens":"Painting,Photography","title":"Wisconsin Death Trip","total occurrences":"2"},"color":"rgb(84,80,68)","size":40.105262756347656},{"x":-1285.1864013671875,"y":-1543.8099365234375,"id":"tt0069342","attributes":{"decade":"1970","color":"#5a544d","Component ID":"0","year":"1972","Degree":"1","country of origin":"Gabon","description":"Abraham is a young sculptor who does not quite understand the changing world in which he lives.

The response, in turn, at first baffles the researchers, until American cartographer David Laughlin deciphers the meaning of the response. In the second, electric company lineman and family man Roy Neary and single mother Jillian Guiler are among some individuals in Muncie, Indiana who experience some paranormal activity before some flashes of bright lights in the sky, which they believe to be a UFO. Roy becomes obsessed with what he saw, unlike some others, especially in some form of authority, who refuse to acknowledge their belief that it was a UFO in not wanting to appear crazy.

Twenty years ago, Duke and Melinda were at the top of the profession as a magician - The Great Duquesne - and his on-stage assistant respectively, they specializing in illusions of the macabre and gore. Cassie reenters the realm of her father\u0027s life when she returns to Los Angeles to attend his funeral, which is as theatrical as his life in that he vowed in his life to emerge from the dead. Beyond this issue, Cassie learns that she is the sole beneficiary of her father\u0027s $300,000 estate, with which those arguably closest to him, Buzz Sheridan and Dolly Bast, his longtime manager and housekeeper respectively, are outwardly all right in Duke\u0027s want to bring Cassie back, she who they state he loved from afar despite Cassie\u0027s belief that he never loved her in not seeking her out in life.

Knowing nothing about Stanley or the Kowalskis\u0027 lives, Blanche is shocked to find that they live in a cramped and run down ground floor apartment - which she proceeds to beautify by putting shades over the open light bulbs to soften the lighting - and that Stanley is not the gentleman that she is used to in men. As such, Blanche and Stanley have an antagonistic relationship from the start. Blanche finds that Stanley\u0027s hyper-masculinity, which often displays itself in physical outbursts, is common, coarse and vulgar, being common which in turn is what attracted Stella to him. Beyond finding Blanche\u0027s delicate hoidy-toidy act as putting on airs, Stanley, a plant worker, believes she may really have sold Belle Reve and is withholding Stella\u0027s fair share of the proceeds from them. What further affects the relationship between the three is that Stella is in the early stage of pregnancy with her and Stanley\u0027s first child. Soon after her arrival at the Kowalskis, Blanche starts to date Mitch, one of Stanley\u0027s friends and coworkers who is a little softer around the edges than most of Stanley\u0027s friends. Mitch does not hide the fact that he is looking in general to get married because of a personal issue, he wanting Blanche ultimately to be his wife. Mitch is somewhat unaware that Blanche has somewhat controlled their courtship to put herself in the best possible light, both figuratively and literally. But in Stanley\u0027s quest to find out the truth about Belle Reve and Blanche\u0027s life in Auriol, the interrelationships between Stanley, Blanche, Stella and Mitch may be irrevocably affected, with any revelation about that life which may further destroy what\u0027s left of Blanche\u0027s already damaged mental state. —Huggo","tokens":"Sculpture","title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","total occurrences":"1"},"color":"rgb(200,176,143)","size":40.0},{"x":-193.6469268798828,"y":-261.579833984375,"id":"tt0137387","attributes":{"decade":"1950","color":"#7b3b32","Component ID":"0","year":"1951","Degree":"1","country of origin":"France","description":"An Arab boy, Abdullah, loves his donkey, Bim, but another boy, Massoud, who also happens to be a prince, is jealous of Abdullah and his relationship with Bim, so Massoud steals the donkey and plays mean tricks on him, such as painting him and trying to cut his ears off.

Frank Gurrmanamana is responsible for preparing the final mortuary ceremonies for his brother who had died six years before. The brother had been buried in Maningrida, but now his remains are being brought back to his home country. Central to the ceremonies is Harry Diama, the senior blood-relative of the deceased man, but Harry lives in Maningrida and is pre-occupied with a pending court-case there involving his son. He is needed to approve each step of the preparations, and is also pivotal in bringing other people to the event, including \"men of importance\" for the dancing. Harry\u0027s continuing absence puts huge pressure on Frank and upon all of the others who must wait at the ceremonial site, including Les Hiatt, Franks\u0027 old anthropologist friend. Harry is also aware that the film crew is waiting to record the event: \"These filmmakers work for us. We\u0027ll see it here - our own film. We\u0027ll all be in it.\" Painting of emblems on the hollow-log coffin proceeds, sand sculptures are made, with Frank expressing his constant concern that it all \"looks good for the film\". Men from Cape Stewart, an area with cultural and traditional trade links to the dead man\u0027s clan, are also needed to make the ceremony work, and further tension surrounds their response to the painting of the coffin. As the day for the ceremony\u0027s climax draws near, Frank grows ever more anxious about the non-arrival of Harry and the people he is supposed to bring. When Harry finally arrives, the final stage of the ceremony is permitted to begin and, though normally performed at night, it is successfully performed in daylight for the benefit of the camera.

We see the difficult conditions in which the vital and charismatic María did her work: the economic crisis, the hunger in the Villa, the bureaucratic opposition and increasing terror of the Senderos. But Coraje is above all a lively and intimate portrait of a fascinating woman who is not portrayed as a inviolable heroine, but as an ordinary woman with two children and a husband who is characterised by doubts and despair as well as courage.

Inspired by the Italian neo-realists, he developed a sensitive style characterized by accurate social observations and poetic verse. This film tells the story of Al and Li, a married couple living in the Prenzlauer Berg district of Berlin. They have only been married for a couple of months but decide to divorce. Alfred, a motorcycle enthusiast, especially pushes for the divorce. He fears losing his independence and freedom to experiment. Alfred takes a couple days off to clear his head, and rides through Berlin meeting friends and strangers. The fact that he ultimately returns to Lisa is possibly a good omen, but the ending remains open. Born in \u002745 was caught in a wave of politically motivated film bans in the summer of 1966 and was not allowed to be shown. The film was described by an official as \"indifferent and insignificant.\" Boettcher chose settings that were \"gloomy, unfriendly, dirty and neglected. Characters and surroundings were created to reflect more a capitalist view of life as opposed to a socialist view of life.\" Only in the spring of 1990, when the film was shown in cinemas, were the true beauties of the film discovered: its rhythm, its lacunae, its disposition. Juergen Boettcher grasped the life of 20-year-olds in Prenzlauer Berg with social and regional exactness and was able to translate it into an elementary world language. —DEFA Film Library","tokens":"Create,Painting,Performance","title":"Born in \u002745","total occurrences":"3"},"color":"rgb(84,80,68)","size":40.21052551269531},{"x":-1100.6004638671875,"y":-309.7497253417969,"id":"tt0140536","attributes":{"decade":"1970","color":"#5a544d","Component ID":"0","year":"1978","Degree":"1","country of origin":"United States","description":"Spins the tale of a woman, her sister, and the man who completes the triangle.

Their mother passed away days after Lorenzo\u0027s birth due to complications from the childbirth exacerbated by illness. With their veteran father still in hospital at the time unable to care for the children, Lorenzo was taken in by Sig. Salocchi, the butler of a wealthy English baron, literally to be raised as his and his wife\u0027s son in privilege, while Enrico remained with their maternal grandmother in relative poverty. The brothers did not truly get to spend time with and get to know each other until 1935 when Lorenzo was on the cusp of adulthood. For Enrico, theirs ended up being a largely strained but still loving relationship. Despite growing up in wealth, Lorenzo, who longed for what Enrico had, namely a history with blood relations, was unable to cope with real life once he no longer had access to that privilege. Although Enrico would admit that his own life was nowhere near perfect, he struggling to discover and thus achieve his own dreams, he tried to get Lorenzo at least to search for his place in life rather than just lament what could or did not be in what cards he was dealt. —Huggo","tokens":"Painting","title":"Family Portrait","total occurrences":"1"},"color":"rgb(216,220,211)","size":40.0},{"x":-888.2316284179688,"y":-937.7177124023438,"id":"tt0070389","attributes":{"decade":"1970","color":"#5a544d","Component ID":"0","year":"1974","Degree":"3","country of origin":"Portugal","description":"Filmed just before the Carnation Revolution of 1974.

Famous Japanese sculptor Matsura (Tatsuo Saitô) creates a new sculpture symbolizing the growing friendship between Japan and the United States. The memorial features an eternal flame. The U.S. High Commissioner to Japan (Larry Keating) is given the honor and he agrees to light the monument\u0027s eternal flame. The Communist spy network in Japan sees an opportunity to sabotage the ceremony and to attempt to assassinate the U.S. High Commissioner. Communist Agent George Underwood (Edmond O\u0027Brien) is entrusted with this task. At the same time, U.S. Intelligence officer Mark Fannon (Robert Wagner) makes a stopover in Tokyo while on a flight to South Korea. Due to the fact that he\u0027s lacking the mandatory Letter of Entry in order to enter or transit Japan, Fannon requests and receives the assistance of Tina Llewellyn (Dame Joan Collins), an English-speaking assistant travel manager of Japan Airlines. In reality, Fannon is on a secret assignment to Tokyo. He checks into a Tokyo hotel and when the bellboy delivers a golf bag with his other luggage, Fannon secretly places a bundle of magazines into its side pocket. Afterwards, he goes to a golf course where he meets Nobika (Solly Nakamura), a Japanese informer, who reveals to Fannon there may be an assassination attempt on the U.S. High Commissioner\u0027s life soon. Fannon delivers the magazines containing coded messages to Nobika. The two men agree to meet again. Unknown to them, Communist Agent George Underwood, disguised as a golfer, is spying on them from a distance. His cover story is that he works as an executive for an American company in Tokyo called the Pacific Coal and Iron Company. Later that night, at the hotel, Fannon bumps into Tina, whose date for the evening is a man whom Fannon recognizes to be Tony Barrett (Ken Scott), an American counter-intelligence Agent stationed in Formosa. The two men are surprised to see one another, but act cool and pretend they don\u0027t know each other, despite Tina\u0027s suspicions. Barrett later ditches Tina and goes to meet Fannon in private. They go to a Japanese steam bath where they can discuss in secret. After exchanging information, Barrett leaves first. Fannon remains inside the steam baths. Not far from him, Communist Agent Underwood decides to eliminate Fannon and jams-shut the steam bath door. He also turns up the thermostat on Fannon\u0027s steam room. Overcome by the intense heat, Fannon collapses. When he regains consciousness, he is in his hotel room and a nurse tells him that a steam room attendant found him in the nick of time and saved his life. Tina arrives with the Letter of Entry, but Fannon reveals to her that he plans to stay in Japan rather than continue his voyage to South Korea. Their discussion is interrupted by a phone call from Japanese informer Nobika, who insists he must pass onto Fannon some very important information concerning the Communist plot to sabotage the U.S.-Japan peace process and to murder the U.S. High Commissioner. Calling from a public phone booth, Nobika is anxious to pass this vital information to the American Agent, but someone following him shoots him dead in the phone booth before he can relay the information. Tracing Nobika\u0027s phone call to Fannon\u0027s hotel room, Lieutenant Afumi (Heihachirô Ôkawa) of the Tokyo Police Department picks up Tina and Fannon as material witnesses. He takes them to the crime scene, and there he shows them a note he found in Nobika\u0027s pocket. Released by the Police, under certain conditions, Fannon decides to investigate his informer\u0027s death himself. For this purpose, he calls his pal in Formosa, counter-intelligence Agent Tony Barrett, who gives Fannon the last known address, in the village of Ogawa, of murdered Japanese informer Nobika. Disregarding Japanese Police\u0027s instructions to remain in Tokyo, Fannon plans to travel to the village of Ogawa and retrieve the magazines containing the secret coded messages he previously passed to informer Nobika on the golf course. Fannon hopes to find out what the coded messages said and to find a clue regarding why and who killed Nobika.

Over the years, however, he changes into a genuine bourgeois with conservative opinions. Anarchy is no more. The disintegrating welfare state has but little to offer, and these young wayward kids easily resort to right-wing radicalism and racist views. This seems to be a major trend in the cities of western Europe. Pinkel is a film about a former punker. He is twenty years old, has a job as a paper-hanger and shares an apartment with his girlfriend and their baby in a Rotterdam slum area. Pinkel (which means something like \u0027little one\u0027) used to be a politically conscious punker. When Pinkel was 14 years old he started working, but gradually he considered the work he was doing dull, and suddenly, as he says in the film, he quit working and became a punker. Pinkel and his friend Geert used to play in the punk rock band The Tändstickorshocks. Pinkel has turned his back on the punk movement, however, and has eventually chosen for a way of life he used to fight against and which he once abhorred and rebelled against. His views concerning women and foreign workers, to name just a few things, are now directly opposed to the ideals which were featured in the radical songs of The Tändstickor-shocks. Anarchy is no more. Nowadays, Pinkel leads a nice and quiet life. This doesn\u0027t imply that there aren\u0027t any problems. Sometimes Pinkel worries about things: how to make enough money to support his family, how to get out of the slum area, and even about life itself. These serious problems notwithstanding, Pinkel is quite confident about the future: he is sure that one day he will make it. This film is representative for a certain group of young people, which can be found in any big city of the west. Part of the film was shot in 1979, during the hey-day of the Dutch punk movement. —Rotterdam Films","tokens":"Painting","title":"Pinkel","total occurrences":"1"},"color":"rgb(145,143,124)","size":40.0},{"x":6.353078365325928,"y":-469.4259338378906,"id":"tt0121703","attributes":{"decade":"1950","color":"#7b3b32","Component ID":"0","year":"1958","Degree":"1","country of origin":"Argentina","description":"Out of the blue, a meek, old painter begins receiving love letters from Rosaura.

Jacobo is interested in the merchandise - a monstrance, a ciborium and other church objects in gold and pearls - and they settle the price.Rita is adapting quickly to the farm life. Carlos explains with pride the pedigree of his mare Stella di Mattino that he will enter in a horses\u0027 contest in a few days.At the King-Kong, Damian offers free drinks for everybody, with the cash received from Jacobo, and the crowd and bar girls start drinking heavily. Alicia takes the stage wearing a long red dress with a slit skirt up to the waist, to sing a love song, the lyrics evocative of infidelity in a relationship (with flashbacks to Alicia smoking alone in a bedroom): \"No es la primera vez / que llego y tu no estás\". Renata, who had had a drink too many, tries to get the attention of Jacobo who rejects her calling her a \"traitress\", as Alicia\u0027s lyrics say, \"I know with whom you\u0027ve been unfaithful\", (with flashes of Alicia\u0027s Boyfriend kissing Renata in bed, with no light on). Renata is wearing a long black skirt and a deep V-neck blue top, and she finally sits by Alicia\u0027s Boyfriend, petting him. She hands him a rolled bank note, which he swiftly puts in his trousers\u0027 pocket but under Alicia\u0027s stare from the stage, he rejects her advances. Renata is not happy with him: \"Why do you do this to me? Don\u0027t I pay you?\" She stands up, and slaps him. Alicia had been boiling on stage already, and now she literally jumps onto the bar girl, turning the table and the chair upside down. The two beauties roll on the floor, clawing and wrestling each other in a leg show for those who are close enough.  Damian enjoys this extra program show: \"Five thousand pesos to the winner!\" (US$ 130 at the 1978 official exchange rate COP/USD)  Alicia has already three nasty scratches on her left cheek, when Renata is straddling her and picks the neck of a broken Johnny Walker Red Label bottle, and menaces Alicia\u0027s face with it. Alicia defends her neck, but ends up being stabbed deeply to the belly. Alicia screams and faints, Renata stops the struggle and starts sobbing.The double-crossing Boyfriend takes Alicia to an adjoining bedroom, while someone calls the hospital. The emergency doctor is not available, so the nurse who takes the call asks Dr. Miguel to go to the King-Kong. Damian recognizes Miguel as \"the man who chopped off my hand\", pulls a dagger and attacks him. Miguel defends himself, while Damian\u0027s bodyguards attack the two male nurses. Lyn May alerts Damian to the arrival of the police, someone turns the lights out to allow Damian and his men to escape.[The Italian version misses all scenes at the King-Kong, and changes Jacobo\u0027s character for a Bald Fencer at a coffee shop in town, to buy the church treasure from Damian and his brother. Damian asks 3 million of pesos for the lot, the man bargains the price down to 2 million (from US$ 78 555 to $ 52 370 at 1978 official exchange rate). In additional scenes, Damian contracts with a man to drug Carlos\u0027 mare, as he creates a distraction for the horse keeper at the stalls. But the plan fails, because Carlos and Antonio are back to the stalls before the man can act. He escapes, and the repenting horse keeper tells Carlos that it was a man with a severed left hand who had paid him a drink... Carlos takes his mare Stella di Mattino to the dressage tournament, and wins, making him and Rita happy.]Damian with his Brother visit Albert, a farmer who\u0027s a friend of his. Damian tells him he has a grudge to settle with Carlos Gomez. Forewarned, Albert had summoned Martin to be present, a farm worker at Carlos\u0027 farm, who is ready to tell Damian what is going on at the farm.Carlos has taken Rita to a night dance outdoors with live music.Martin tells Damian that Carlos is going to sell 200 cattle heads, and Damian decides to rob them before he does.Carlos leaves the dance for a stroll in the park with Rita. Since the place is secluded and the evening hot, Rita decides to take a swim in the river, for which she strips naked, soon followed by Carlos. They return to the shore, and make love on the grass.Damian makes a proposition to a man in a bar with billiards, to sell his 200 cattle heads for 2 millon pesos, plus 500,000 for the horse. The buyer bargains it down to 2,2 millions.Carlos asks Antonio if everything is ready, and is happy that it is so. Rita is already mounting by his side as if she\u0027d always done so.  But Carlos receives a message from the chief of police, and he leaves the ranch to Antonio, warning him not to tell Rita that he went to the police so that she does not worry. At the police station, Carlos knows that the three policemen who had gone out for Damian had been found murdered, and when shown photographs os suspects, he identifies Martin among them, and of course, Damian. The chief of police suspects that Damian also murdered his two companions whose bodies had been found in the jungle.Carlos drives back to the ranch in the evening, while Martin receives Damian and Albert\u0027s men to rob the cattle and the prize winning horse.Antonio picks a rifle from the house and gets out to oppose the robbery, and Rosa stays home, asking Rita to pick a rifle too, to defend the house. Antonio and a few farm hands engage the robbers in a shoot out, and Antonio is wounded to the head.Damian and his brother force the entrance to the house, and easily dominate Rita and Rosa. Damian\u0027s brother rips off Rosa\u0027s shirt, and rapes her. Still he has time to find some sticks of dynamite, and Damian decides to blow up the house and set fire to the farm warehouses.Antonio finds Carlos on the road, and warns him of what is happening. They arrive in time to free Rosa and stop the fuse of the dynamite.Damian and his brother, stopped their jeep by the river, expecting to meet with a man in a canoe - that is not there. Carlos stops in the palm-trees plantation when he sees the fugitives\u0027 jeep, and gives chase on foot with a machete. Damian\u0027s brother tries to ambush him as he did with the policemen, but his shot misses and the revolver jams. A machete duel follows, with Rita, hand\u0027s tied behind her back, shouts for Carlos in despair, until Carlos with a swiping thrust, opens up his opponent\u0027s stomach.Damian sees his brother\u0027s falling like a tree log, throws Rita to the ground and draws his revolver, but Carlos disarms him with a punch.  Both men fistfight for domination. Eventually Carlos knocks Damian back and into the river, where the fight goes on for a while. Carlos stands and walks to the river\u0027s bank, but Damian does not - the piranhas get him first (flashes of Lyn May cross his mind).Carlos unties Rita, and the couple kisses.","tokens":"Create,Photography,Sculpture,Performance","title":"Las muñecas del King Kong","total occurrences":"4"},"color":"rgb(145,143,124)","size":40.31578826904297},{"x":-1383.7919921875,"y":1270.1553955078125,"id":"tt0057977","attributes":{"decade":"1960","color":"#8b6b57","Component ID":"0","year":"1965","Degree":"1","country of origin":"Argentina","description":"CHRONICLE OF A BOY ALONE, is an indictment of a fascist regime running roughshod over its most vulnerable citizens, its children.

Surprisingly, this is exactly the picture he keeps drawing on pen cases as a calling. He is then jolted into realities. The thought of the old man gradually begins to loom over his life and sow the seed of anxiety. The narrator embarks on a journey in search of the ethereal girl and the old man. His journey, however, takes him into a study of history and myths. The narrator comes back and realizes that his uncle has left, leaving the door agape like the mouth of a dead man.

In the MacGruder\u0027s barn, a group of boys are holding a meeting about whether to admit two brothers, Tommy (Chance Michael Corbitt) and Ben (Ryan Todd) to their club, and are dared to climb Thunder Mountain, where it is said a giant lives. Tommy and Ben accept the dare and set out up the mountain. They are caught in a thunderstorm and take refuge inside the giant\u0027s oversized log cabin, and find mysterious carved wooden figures the giant has carved. Suddenly, the giant returns and finds the boys hiding under a table, but they escape with one of the wooden figures and go back to town. When the boys reach home they tell Zeke MacGruder their amazing story, but he doesn\u0027t believe them. The next morning, they set out with Zeke (Daniel Pipoly) to prove to him they have seen the giant. Tommy and Ben\u0027s younger sister, Amy (Noley Thornton) follows the three boys, and almost gets caught in a bear trap. The boys tell her to leave, but she persists and continues following them. The four children watch the giant from the woods moving logs by his cabin, and Zeke is scared and runs back home, but Amy steps out from the woods and introduces herself and her brothers to the giant, Eli Weaver (Richard Kiel). They help him with his chores including helping him plant young fir trees. The boys volunteer to get water for the trees and go in the cabin to fetch a bucket. When they do so, they discover some of Eli\u0027s gold nuggets. Tommy puts a few in his pocket, and they go outside and fill the bucket with water. Eli\u0027s pet wolf shows up to check out the children and after this, the children return to town. Amy discovers Tommy and Ben looking at the gold nuggets in their bedroom, and they allow her to have a nugget with the promise she won\u0027t tell their mother. Amy goes to the general store to buy candy with the nugget, and Hezekiah Crow (Jack Elam) overhears her and says he is an expert in gauging whether a nugget is gold or not, and proclaims the nugget as being \"Fool\u0027s Gold\". In trade, he offers her tickets to his carnival, and she bargains for extra tickets so she can invite Eli. She goes to see Eli and invites him to dinner and gives him one of the carnival tickets. Eli, now clean shaven, comes to the Wilson\u0027s house for dinner, and after dinner, repairs their cuckoo clock. Hezekiah Crow\u0027s circus parades through Weaverton, hosted by Zeke\u0027s father, Mr. MacGruder (Ed Williams). As Eli and Amy watch the carnival parade, which includes an elephant, jugglers, a lion, boa constrictor, clowns, a camel, and an acrobat. The final act, a trained black bear, reminds Eli of the horrible day a grizzly bear (Bart the Bear) killed his parents. At a circus booth, run by one of Hezekiah\u0027s sons, Percey Crow, (William Sanderson), Eli throws balls to knock down stacked pins to win a beautiful doll for Amy. Percey puts a rod through the pins so they can\u0027t be knocked over, but Eli\u0027s final throw breaks the pins and he expects the carnival man to give Amy the doll, but instead he gives her an inferior doll. Amy is disappointed, and Eli grabs hold of the carnival man and lifts him in the air and then drops him on the ground. Eli hands the beautiful ceramic doll to Amy. A crowd has gathered around Eli, and Amy\u0027s mother appears and scolds Amy for causing trouble. The crowd shout insults at Eli and Eli crushes the doll\u0027s head with one squeeze and warns the town to stay off Thunder Mountain. Amy tries to get Eli to stay, but he leaves for his cabin on Thunder Mountain. At a bar in town, several men (including old man Doc) are playing poker. Hezekiah and his two sons plot to go to Eli\u0027s cabin to obtain Eli\u0027s gold. Meanwhile, at his cabin, Eli burns the wooden statuette he carved of Amy. Amy goes to see Eli and says she is sorry for what happened in town, and the two are friends again. Eli and Amy go for a walk in the woods and he shows her the biggest tree in the forest \"The General\". Tommy and Ben go to find Amy and at the cabin are accosted by Hezekiah Crow and his two sons. They kidnap Ben, knock out Tommy, and take Eli\u0027s gold. Hearing the approach of a posse, they escape out a window in the back of the cabin, leaving Tommy lying unconscious on the floor. Meanwhile, in the woods, the grizzly (Bart the Bear) approaches Eli and Amy, and Eli fights the bear and knocks it out with a tree branch. Amy runs for the cabin and Eli limps along after her. Amy arrives at the cabin and runs to her mother. The posse do not ascertain what is going on and assume Eli has taken Amy\u0027s brothers and set out to catch him. While being stalked, Eli is shot and wounded in the leg by a man of the posse. Eli hides under a pile of leaves and surprises one of the men of the posse who has caught his leg in his own bear trap. He takes the man\u0027s gun and takes the trap off the man\u0027s leg. The posse burns Eli\u0027s cabin as revenge for their mistaken belief he kidnapped the children. Amy and her mom return to town with Tommy. The kidnappers go to the MacGruder\u0027s house to steal their belongings and Eli tracks them down and frees the MacGruder\u0027s and Ben. Hezekiah Crow tries to trick Eli and escapes out a window. Eli follows him and Hezekiah comes face to face in the dark with the true Giant of Thunder Mountain, the grizzly. Caught between Eli and the bear, he surrenders to Eli and the posse. The movie concludes with the town asking Eli if he would become their Sheriff, and promise to rebuild his cabin. Eli says he must return to the mountain, but leaves as their friend. —Denis Mortenson","tokens":"Sculpture","title":"The Giant of Thunder Mountain","total occurrences":"1"},"color":"rgb(84,80,68)","size":40.0},{"x":-1380.6004638671875,"y":-794.7239379882812,"id":"tt0068699","attributes":{"decade":"1970","color":"#5a544d","Component ID":"0","year":"1973","Degree":"1","country of origin":"United States","description":"A Stranger (Clint Eastwood) rides into in the dusty mining town of Lago, where the townspeople are living in the shadow of a dark secret.

(\"The baby\", a young woman in the next room, is in fact awakened by the sounds of the moaning.) He caresses her vagina, and she tells him to do the other thing. Robert obligingly tears her panties off and then penetrates both her vagina and anus with his fingers and spanks her.Hearing all of this, the young has gotten up out of bed and gone over to look in a mirror, removing the top of her nightgown and caressing her own breasts as she listens and applies red lipstick to first her mouth and then her nipple.Robert puts all of his fingers into the woman\u0027s vagina. In the other room, the young woman hears her saying that she doesn\u0027t want to come yet. She picks up a brush and runs it through her hair, before going over to a full-length mirror and completely removing her nightgown.Robert puts his thumb into the woman\u0027s vagina, \"fisting\" her to her obvious pleasure as he continues to tell her to be quiet. The young woman is brushing her pubic hair with the brush while listening. She turns out the lights and heads back to bed.The man removes his hand and is then shown to have penetrated the woman and has sex with her for a short interval before ejaculating on her buttocks. He feeds her the ejaculate. After a moment of darkness, they are shown lying in bed as they share a cigarette. She asks if they can do it again, and he wearily suggests another time soon. Turning off the lights, she asks if she was loud, and Robert tells her that she might have woken \"the baby\" up, and that she might be listening right outside the door.The young woman is in bed masturbating with her hairbrush. She apparently achieves orgasm and licks the handle before turning out the light and lying down to sleep ... still wearing her high heeled shoes.Later, a faucet is running, pouring water into the drain of a tub while the young woman (Sandy) dries herself and caresses her leg, before she starts to rub her abdomen and breasts while looking into a mirror. She is startled when Robert, also naked, comes into the bathroom, holding a finger to his lips in a \"shush\" gesture. She stares at him in surprise. He approaches her and begins to kiss and caress her hair and upper back, telling her that they don\u0027t want to wake mommy. Sandy tells him that he shouldn\u0027t be in here, but he shushes her, telling her that it\u0027s all right.Turning her around so that she looks in the mirror, Robert proceeds to slide down so that his face is at the level of her buttocks, he tells her to look in the mirror while he kisses her buttocks. She tells him no, but he convinces her to turn around so that she\u0027s facing him, and spreads her legs. While Sandy tries to cover her vagina, telling him that she doesn\u0027t want him to look, he gets her to reveal it to him. He caresses it, questioning her about whether she\u0027s washed it. She claims that she has. He persuades her to show how she did that, using a cloth. After doing so, she continues to try and cover it with her hand, while he tells to take her hand away, eventually convincing her to do so. He begins to lick her vagina, asking her whether she likes it. She claims that doesn\u0027t, but Robert continues, before standing up and rubbing his erection against it. She pleads with him to stop, before changing her tune and pleading with him to do it now. Before he can penetrate, however, \"mommy\" comes in the door and stares at them.Later, Sandy is in her room, dressed in lingerie, as she makes a phone call. She muses that her identical twin sister, Denise, was right about Robert ogling them, and her claims that Robert wanted her rather than their mother. She wonders if Denise already knows about what\u0027s happened and is waiting for her to come to her. She also wonders if she\u0027ll ever see Robert again, as she\u0027s about to become a runaway just like her sister.Elsewhere, a phone rings as another young woman (Bonnie) bends to pick up a tennis ball, flashing her panties to the man on the other side of the court before smiling at him. She looks at the ringing phone, but dismisses it with a shake of her head. It continues to ring as she serves the ball. Back in her room, Sandy hangs up the phone.At the tennis court, the man (Lyle) tells Bonnie that she\u0027s not cooperating with him, and starts to say something about how if she wasn\u0027t his brother\u0027s girlfriend, he\u0027d do something. She interrupts, telling him that while his brother Jimmy is sweet, she has a problem. She\u0027s very aroused, and just wants to lie down by the pool and cool off. Lyle agrees, ending the tennis lesson. She proceeds to deliberately drop her racket, giving him another look at her panties.Over a shot of a house, Bonnie claims that her analyst has told her she has too much unresolved sexual energy, making her clumsy. While Lyle wants to talk to her about her serve, the phone starts to ring again, and she runs off, telling him that she\u0027ll meet him at the pool. Bonnie picks up the phone.On the other end, Sandy, who has gotten dressed (all in white) and tarted to pack a suitcase, tells Bonnie who\u0027s calling. Bonnie mocks her for thinking that she wouldn\u0027t recognize the voice, then claims that she can\u0027t talk now as Lyle is there. Sandy asserts that her situation is important, to which Bonnie replies that unless it\u0027s life or death, it\u0027s not more important than what she has planned. Sandy asks her whether or not Bonnie is her best friend, then tells her that she\u0027s coming over to Bonnie\u0027s place. Bonnie tells her that she wants at least one hour with Lyle, hanging up while Sandy tries to tell her about what\u0027s happened to her.At poolside, Bonnie strips off her shorts, while Lyle (sitting nearby) asks her about what she\u0027s learning in analysis. Bonnie jumps into the pool wearing just her panties and shirt, which becomes transparent (revealing that she\u0027s not wearing a bra), while telling Lyle that her analyst has told her that she should masturbate.The scene cuts to a living room, with Lyle seated on a couch while Bonnie lies down on the floor, wearing a short bathrobe and a towel on her head, and offers to show him what she\u0027s learned. He hesitates, asks if there\u0027s anyone else in the house. She tells him there\u0027s no one else around, and that he can have anything he likes. He asks for something cold, and she sits up, asking him if he wouldn\u0027t rather have something hot, and gets the rest of the way up.The scene cuts to Bonnie seated in a car with the door open with her legs spread, rubbing her exposed vagina, as the radio plays. Lyle stands in front of the door to the house watching. She tells him to get in and drive. He gets in and tells her that he can\u0027t do what she wants. Irritatedly, she tells him she gets it, that he should just drive. Abruptly, he changes his mind.They go back into the living room and begin kissing. Lyle pulls off Bonnie\u0027s bathrobe and pushes her to her knees, exposing his erection. She begins to lick and caress at it, to his excitement. However, Bonnie begins to have second thoughts about this, which Lyle overrules, telling her to perform oral sex on him, which she does. He lies down on the couch and tells her to play with herself while performing on him. He reaches down and begins to rub her vagina, and she begs him not to tease her. Bonnie is lying on the floor as Lyle, crouched between her legs, starts to perform oral sex on her. He then has sex with her in a number of positions before achieving climax.Later, Bonnie (in her robe) and Sandy are seated on the couch as Sandy asks Bonnie to help her to get to the train station. Bonnie agrees, but says that she has to take a shower to get Lyle\u0027s aftershave off of her. Sandy reflects on what happened with Robert and her mother, and recalls that she wanted Robert; so did Denise, who used to lie awake in her room listening to Robert and her mother having sex. She wonders if Denise is still working for that lady in New York. Sandy hears a car pulling into the driveway in front of Bonnie\u0027s house, and goes to look out a window. She sees that her mother (dressed all in black) has followed her there, and heads out the back way, into the woods.Later, Sandy is sitting on her suitcase on the side of the road when a van drives past then comes to a stop near her. The driver, a scruffy looking man, gets out and asks her if she needs a lift. She ignores him, but he tells her that he is his way to New York, as he has a show there. She replies that she\u0027s going to take a bus. He tells her that this is her lucky day, introduces himself as Harlan, and produces a rose from the air, handing it to her and claiming to be a magician. All this distracts Sandy from the fact that her bus is departing. He repeats his offer to take her to New York, subtly pointing out that if she stays where she is, sooner or later someone will tell her parents where she is so that they can come and get her. That makes Sandy accept his offer. She gets in the van, but realizes that she\u0027s forgotten her suitcase. Harlan magically causes the back door of the van to open, and makes the suitcase move to rest in the back of the van.In a motel room, a woman is waiting on the bed as Harlan and Sandy arrive. She\u0027s introduced as Marie, and agrees that they should take Sandy to New York first thing in the morning. Harlan and Marie embrace, before heading out to get a bite to eat, leaving Sandy alone in the room.Later, Sandy has changed into a baby doll nightgown and is braiding her hair when Harlan and Marie return. They sit down on either side of her, and tell her that she can sleep anywhere she wants. Sandy nervously indicates that she\u0027ll sleep on the cot in the corner. She gets up and heads over there, bending over to expose her naked bottom to them, before getting between the sheets of the cot. Harlan bids Marie to pour him a drink. Harlan speculates about Sandy\u0027s innocence, and then muses that Marie enjoys this sort of thing as much as he does. Marie agrees that she loves to have sex while someone watches. She exposes her breasts, and Harlan, after sucking them for a moment, decides that the time has come to act.He gestures in Sandy\u0027s direction, and the sheets on her cot magically pull away. Another gesture, and her nightgown is also pulled away, leaving her naked. Moving his hands in the air as Marie pulls his pants open, Harlan causes Sandy to levitate in mid-air above her cot. Harlan stands up and moves his hands over and around Sandy\u0027s body to demonstrate that nothing is holding her up. He then carries her over to a chair near the bed.Harlan suckles at Marie\u0027s breast. In a voiceover (telepathically, perhaps) Harlan tells Marie that he\u0027s reaching out for Sandy now, as the girl is in a deep trance. Sandy is also sitting with her legs spread widely and rubbing one of her breasts. Again in a voiceover, Harlan bids Sandy to open her mind and let him in, all the while he performs oral sex on Marie. Sandy masturbates, and, in voiceover, she asks what Harlan is doing; he replies (in the same way) that he wants her to feel everything that they\u0027re feeling. Marie performs oral sex on Harlan while he does the same to her, while Sandy indicates that she\u0027s feeling pleasure. Harlan has sex with Marie while Sandy masturbates wildly. (Harlan doesn\u0027t visibly climax, though both Marie and Sandy apparently orgasm.)Later, a still naked Sandy is alone in a hotel room that shows none of the signs of occupancy that were there last night. She searches it for a moment, in confusion.Sandy is standing by the side of the road, and catches a lift from a passing motorist. They drive into New York city over the Brooklyn Bridge, and we next see her walking the streets of the city. She comes to a park (Central Park, probably) before sitting down in a field. A woman (Lyla) comes by and offers her some balloons, but releases them before Sandy is ready to take them. They soar off into the air as she watches, and the woman walks away, meets with a man wearing sunglasses, and points Sandy out to him. They then both walk away, leaving Sandy alone. She walks to look at her reflection in a creek.Elsewhere, a woman (Rhonda) is taking a shower. A man (Snow) arrives in the bathroom, and wearing a wig, pulls open the shower curtain and fakes a knife attack on Rhonda before handing her a bouquet of flowers and teasing her about how scared she was. Furiously, she drives him out of the bathroom, pelting him with objects as he runs.Later, Snow is lying in bed with just his jeans on, going through Rhonda\u0027s purse (he casually steals some money) before pulling open his pants, calling out to her to come in as he\u0027s got something for her. He turns on the TV. Rhonda, apparently still upset about the whole \"fake attack\" thing, comes in and picks up a long cigarette, and then goes out again, much to Joe\u0027s irritation.Rhonda goes into an office, followed by Snow, who begins caressing one of her legs, putting her in a better mood. The camera lingers on a painting that somewhat resembles Sandy. After a kiss, she tells him that a Mr. Prince is in town, looking for something special. She also says that she found an Italian silk he wanted, and that he can take the money to pay for it out of her bag. He tells her that he already has. Amused by this, she taunts him a bit, and he pulls down his pants and begins to caress her as a thunderstorm begins outside.In the bedroom, Rhonda is performing oral sex on Snow while the storm rages outside. He flips her around and begins having sex with her while she insults him. He moves her over to the bed and they continue to have sex. After a while, he makes her perform oral sex on him again, before resuming sex. (All this is interspersed with shots of various dolls \"watching\".) Snow penetrates Rhonda\u0027s anus, and proceeds to have anal sex with her until he ejaculates on her thighs. He uses one of the dolls to feed the ejaculate to Rhonda.Later, in the office, Rhonda tells Snow that she\u0027ll see him later and sends him off with a portfolio for Mr. Prince. He tells her that he\u0027s not her errand boy, but goes off with the portfolio, opening the door just as Sandy is about to knock. He mistakes her for Denise and pulls her in, asking her what she\u0027s doing here. Rhonda stops him before he can say something about Denise\u0027s whereabouts, and says that this must be Sandy. Sandy asks whether her sister is here or not, and Rhonda tells her that Denise is off on a \"special assignment\" for her. Rhonda shows her the painting, which is apparently of Denise. She tells Snow to apologize to Sandy, and then sends him away. He tries to tell Rhonda something, but she sends him off. Rhonda compliments Sandy on her looks, saying that she can definitely use her in some undefined way, and offers her a glass of brandy.Elsewhere, Lyla is painting while wearing a smock that allows her access to her vagina, so that she can also masturbate, which she does. Snow comes to the door and rings the bell, but the woman is too focused on her pleasure to answer it. He repeatedly rigngs the bell, and she finally comes to the door just as he\u0027s leaving. He tells her that he\u0027s here to see Mr. Prince, but she just stares at him for a while, before telling him that Mr. Prince isn\u0027t here. Snow says that he\u0027ll come in and wait.He does so, and comes over to see what the woman is painting, and we see that it\u0027s a picture of an erect penis. Snow reveals that he knows Lyla\u0027s name, and claims that everyone knows about her, but that only he has what she needs. Lyla bids him show her, and he takes out his erection. She dabs red paint on the tip of it, and runs it up his shirt to dab it on his lips as well. He kisses her, and then picks her up to carry her over to a couch, where he strips naked and performs oral sex on her. She then does the same to him. After some more oral sex on her, he begins to have sex with her, before ejaculating on her stomach.Later, the man we saw with her earlier (obviously Mr. Prince, who is also revealed to be Robert or someone who sure looks like Robert) comes in to find Lyla lying on the couch naked. He stares at her, but without comment, picks up the portfolio and walks away.Rhonda has gifted Sandy with a fancy dress, which she describes as her work. She also tells Rhonda that she\u0027s absolutely perfect, begins to rub Sandy\u0027s back, and says that she\u0027s ready The scene dissolves so that Rhonda and Sandy are standing in a dark room while Mr. Prince stands on a balcony above them, looking down. Sandy looks up, realizes who Mr. Prince is, flashes back to a shot of Robert looking up at her, and tells Rhonda to take her hand off her, as she knows what to do. A series of strange images, intercutting shots of Bonnie with shots of a masked woman, follows. Sandy opens her dress to expose her naked body to Mr. Prince.Rhonda, now looking very different, comes down the stairs to where Sandy is lying on a bed in her lingerie, and begins to kiss her and lick at her breasts, before performing oral sex on her. Rhonda penetrates both herself and Sandy with a double-headed dildo and has sex with Sandy while Mr. Prince watches, with Sandy expressing her delight in voiceover. Then Rhonda pulls away, despite Sandy\u0027s voiced-over pleas. She is left alone, and writhes on the bed, beckoning Mr. Prince to come down to her. Sandy flashes back to peeping on her mother performing oral sex on Robert, and Robert seing her doing so.Snow, standing naked before Sandy, comes over to let her perform oral sex on him, and rubs her vagina. But he also walks away, despite her voiced-over pleas to let her continue. Sandy lies on the bed, and an image of Bonnie flashes on the screen again, followed by a shot of Harlan seen through flames, before the image returns to Sandy. A ghostly image appears to rise from her body and walk away from it. On the staircase, Sandy in her more innocent appearance looks down smugly. Mr. Prince has descended from the balcony and stands before Sandy, before coming to sit down on the bed beside her. In voiceover, she calls him Daddy, and sits up to remove his mirrored sunglasses. She reveals that Robert was her first love, and flashes back to an even more innocent period in their relationship, when he gave her her first kiss. Back in the present, he strips off his clothes, and obedient to her voiced-over request, he begins to have sex with her. He ejaculates on her, and fades to black.Lyla comes down the stairs carrying a pillow, and brings it over to Sandy and Mr. Prince, who are reclining on the bed. Sandy examines her reflection in it for a moment, and then puts it down between her legs, where it reflects a very different face on the man who\u0027s with her. This man is then revealed to be the one who is with her, provoking a voiced-over scream. This person, not Robert, was the one who kissed her, and touched her before pulling away. The innocent Sandy on the stairs smirks down again, and the scene dissolves from a shot of this man.The young woman whose activities we have been watching wakes up in bed, tossing and turning. She opens the top drawer beside her bed, and pulls out an envelope. Within is a photograph of the man who gave Sandy her first kiss, with the words \"I love you, Daddy\" written on it. Also in the envelope is a card, containing a note from Daddy to his daughter, explaining that he can\u0027t be with her for reasons that he can\u0027t explain. As the letter is read aloud in voice over, the young woman flashes back to this man pulling back her covers to look down at her while she lies in her bed, looking up at him. The letter concludes with the message, \"All my love forever, Daddy\".The young woman is in the bathroom, caressing her breasts, when Robert comes in, naked, and shushes her, saying that they don\u0027t want to wake her mother ...","tokens":"Painting,Photography,Performance","title":"Neon Nights","total occurrences":"3"},"color":"rgb(145,143,124)","size":40.21052551269531},{"x":1191.693115234375,"y":1911.376220703125,"id":"tt0093354","attributes":{"decade":"1980","color":"#616c61","Component ID":"0","year":"1987","Degree":"1","country of origin":"United Kingdom","description":"The son of a priest slain by the Mau Mau moves in with a police officer and his wife in 1950 Kenya.","tokens":"Painting","title":"The Kitchen Toto","total occurrences":"1"},"color":"rgb(145,143,124)","size":40.0},{"x":-1500.6004638671875,"y":-586.8778686523438,"id":"tt0407889","attributes":{"decade":"1970","color":"#5a544d","Component ID":"0","year":"1974","Degree":"1","country of origin":"United States","description":"A surreal portrait of the New York subculture.","tokens":"Painting","title":"Injun fender","total occurrences":"1"},"color":"rgb(237,227,182)","size":40.0},{"x":309.0888671875,"y":-1057.673095703125,"id":"tt0139414","attributes":{"decade":"1990","color":"#baa79b","Component ID":"0","year":"1999","Degree":"1","country of origin":"United States","description":"Shortly after the horrifying underwater attack in Maine\u0027s Black Lake, the local Fish and Game officer, Jack Wells, enlists the help of the New York City palaeontologist, Kelly Scott, to investigate.

At the first light of the morning, however, Mario decides and, after killing his wife, entrusts the child to the policemen and surrenders. —Anonymous","tokens":"Sculpture","title":"Fire!","total occurrences":"1"},"color":"rgb(216,220,211)","size":40.0},{"x":-1808.26708984375,"y":-1028.0281982421875,"id":"tt0070842","attributes":{"decade":"1970","color":"#5a544d","Component ID":"0","year":"1973","Degree":"2","country of origin":"Netherlands","description":"Sort of a cross between Love Story (1970) and an earthy Rembrandt painting, this movie stars Rutger Hauer as gifted Dutch sculptor Eric, who has a stormy, erotic, and star-crossed romance with a beautiful young girl. The story follows the arc of their relationship and his interaction with her family. Told in flashback form, initially, Eric is seen as a libertine lothario collector, taking trophies from his sexual conquests and pasting them in a book. He sees a sculpture he made of his lost lover and goes into a flashback of his relationship with his wife. He meets the girl, falls in love with and marries her, and we meet her parents: a charming, well meaning, bumbling father, and his shrew of a wife, who\u0027s convinced Eric is too much of a bohemian to make a good mate for her daughter. Eventually, the petty jealousies, the sexual hijinks, and the climactic vomit scene prove to be too much for the marriage, and Eric and his lady separate. Flash forward several months, and Eric finds the girl back in The Netherlands after an American sojourn. Their reunion is short lived. The somewhat melodramatic ending mirrors Love Story (1970). —\u003ccfidalgo@intrex.net\u003e","tokens":"Painting,Sculpture","title":"Turkish Delight","total occurrences":"2"},"color":"rgb(237,227,182)","size":40.105262756347656},{"x":-1516.5009765625,"y":805.110595703125,"id":"tt0055111","attributes":{"decade":"1960","color":"#8b6b57","Component ID":"0","year":"1961","Degree":"2","country of origin":"West Germany","description":"When the wife of Sebastian Schumann left her family, he told his little daughter that her mother has died, because he thought that this was the easiest way for her to accept that her mother is now gone.
