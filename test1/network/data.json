Arnold does all he can to defend himself from his friend\u0027s blackmail, but Eddie is so determined to have his \"pound of flesh\" that he kills a series of people to show just how serious he is, thus forcing Arnold to reveal his secret on television. —Anonymous","tokens":"Create","total occurrences":"1"},"color":"rgb(219,102,230)","size":20.0},{"label":"Terrified","x":-113.85601043701172,"y":-2364.632080078125,"id":"tt7549892","attributes":{"Out-Degree":"0","decade":"2010","In-Degree":"2","color":"#d0d5be","year":"2017","Degree":"2","genres":"Horror","country of origin":"Argentina","Clustering Coefficient":"0.0","description":"Allbreck, Jano and Rosentock are researchers of paranormal phenomena.

The show tackles tongue-in-cheek re-enactments of horror stories interspersed with interviews with the people who have knowledge or have had experienced the hauntings. Now, GBS Network wants to bring it to primetime- provided that they present an entirely new concept. Carlo takes the challenge and decides to shoot in Siquijor- an Island in the south well-known of its mysticism. But that\u0027s just the beginning of things to come. The network assigns Doreen Jimenez as the executive producer of the new show. She has reputation of developing great shows for the network. But Doreen is Carlo\u0027s former flame. They still have unresolved issues to deal with. And now, she\u0027s breathing behind her neck and has a hand in the creative decisions. She even replaced Carlo\u0027s resident cameraman and writer much to Carlo\u0027s disgust. Alex Alonzo, Carlo\u0027s current girlfriend and the show\u0027s host tries to calm him down and encourage him to ignore Doreen. Together with Alex Yniquez, the show\u0027s new cameraman, Jake Bernal, the writer and Miguel Sarmiento, the production assistant, they travel to Siquijor. During their stay in Siquijor nothing odd happens in the island. So Carlo resorted back to his old ways- he stages a possession in order to get what he wanted because they\u0027re running out of time. But like a catalyst- as soon as they\u0027ve finished shooting the pseudo-possession and went back to Manila- strange things start to happen to each members of the team. It\u0027s as if they\u0027ve been cursed. Carlo tries to investigate what is really happening. He probes into the events and digs deeper into their footages with the help of his editor Neil. As he does, a whirlwind of chilling mystery ensues steadily building up into a hell-raising finale. In the end, the crew learns that truth is indeed stranger than fiction. But is it too late to redeem themselves? —viva","tokens":"Writing","total occurrences":"1"},"color":"rgb(255,88,10)","size":20.0},{"label":"The Blackwell Ghost 3","x":1658.9385986328125,"y":-3102.74658203125,"id":"tt10323214","attributes":{"Out-Degree":"0","decade":"2010","In-Degree":"1","color":"#d0d5be","year":"2019","Degree":"1","genres":"Horror","country of origin":"United States","Clustering Coefficient":"0.0","description":"A filmmaker takes a journey to discover a new haunted house and brings along his cameras to document what happens inside.

In an effort to stop the dreams, Hamilton seeks the aid of Joe\u0027s creator (Marins, as himself), who tries to convince him that Joe is not an actual demon but a flamboyant character he intends to lampoon in his latest film. —Ørnås","tokens":"Create,Performance","total occurrences":"2"},"color":"rgb(192,192,192)","size":20.058565139770508},{"label":"Krokodyle","x":-448.51922607421875,"y":-1893.3572998046875,"id":"tt1662519","attributes":{"Out-Degree":"0","decade":"2010","In-Degree":"3","color":"#d0d5be","year":"2010","Degree":"3","genres":"Biography,Fantasy,Horror","country of origin":"Italy","Clustering Coefficient":"0.0","description":"Kaspar is a young filmmaker willing to develop his projects in cinema. He passes his time drawing, writing and making up his own imaginary world, that day by day seems to be getting more and more real. He shares his thoughts with Helix, a young photographer interested in death and the capture of images, with Schulz, a doll maker who is obsessed by the theories about creation and dummies, and with Bertolt, a fellow filmmaker that never got over the failure of his first movie, destroyed by a short-sighted production team.To fix his ideas, Kaspar begins shooting a movie on himself, a sort of book of cinematic notes, made from drawings, pictures, short animations, sounds, words and music... made of dreams and nightmares.As time goes by, his movie takes shape but Kaspar increasingly grows away from the real world, until he eventually realizes that he himself is just a product of his own imagination, and that all of his pals are really imaginary friends.Nonetheless, before he completely vanishes into his own dreams, he understands that there\u0027s something he can do to leave a sign, a trace in the real world, that will testify to his existence, his ideas, his desires. Kaspar realizes that, just like a real human being is able to give birth to imaginary characters and fantastic worlds, an imaginary being like himself has the power to create real things.Source: twitchfilm.net","tokens":"Create,Photography,Performance","total occurrences":"3"},"color":"rgb(192,192,192)","size":20.117130279541016},{"label":"Wind Chill","x":-5231.47265625,"y":3988.90625,"id":"tt0486051","attributes":{"Out-Degree":"0","decade":"2000","In-Degree":"1","color":"#dcd1ca","year":"2007","Degree":"1","genres":"Adventure,Drama,Horror","country of origin":"United States,United Kingdom","Clustering Coefficient":"0.0","description":"A couple of college students known only as the Girl and the Guy are traveling home to Delaware the day before Christmas Eve.

He goes on to investigate this connection further, but rather than looking to classic horror films, Petty explores the seedy underground genre of fetish films. These movies are basically simulated snuff films where victims are raped and murdered in a variety of fantasy scenarios. The most notorious of these is a series called \"S\u0026Man,\" where voyeurism takes center stage as people are unknowingly followed with a camera. Petty plunges headfirst into this world of bizarre fetish films, and comes up with mesmerizing interviews with the producers and actors of these movies. Much of the footage from these videos will shock and disturb even the most seasoned horror veteran. However, the connection that Petty draws between these films and mainstream horror classics like \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" and \"Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer\" proves even more unsettling. Using interviews with Carol Clover (author off the definitive horror book, \"Men, Women, and Chainsaws), and his personal experience as a horror director, Petty suggests that viewers\u0027 interest in horror films is rooted in the same voyeuristic urge to which these fetish videos appeal. Ulitmately, Petty directly confronts the audience, forcing them to examine their fascination with horror, torture, and violence. And for genre fans, these implications may make S\u0026MAN the most unsettling horror film experience in years. —Brian Clark","tokens":"Writing,Painting,Photography,Performance","total occurrences":"4"},"color":"rgb(192,192,192)","size":20.175695419311523},{"label":"Descention","x":-2279.071044921875,"y":-2726.048828125,"id":"tt3457290","attributes":{"Out-Degree":"0","decade":"2010","In-Degree":"1","color":"#d0d5be","year":"2016","Degree":"1","genres":"Horror","country of origin":"United States","Clustering Coefficient":"0.0","description":"An assignment duty nurse goes in search of her live-in boyfriend, a successful photographer, to the Church run psychiatric institute, after he has a psychotic break.

He is scarcely seated in a quiet corner when a hideous, shriveled-up old man taps him upon the shoulder and whispers vaguely of a big inheritance for Prague\u0027s finest swordsman and wildest student if he will enter into a certain agreement. Balduin rebuffs him, satirically asking his weird companion to procure him \"the luckiest ticket in a lottery or a doweried wife.\" The old man goes off chuckling and thence onward persistently shadows Balduin, exerting a sinister influence over him, while Balduin is still disconsolate under the frowns of fortune. The Countess Margit Schwarzenberg, hunting with her cousin, to whom her father has betrothed her, meets with an accident. She is thrown over her horse\u0027s head into a river, but Balduin, who has been directed to the spot by his evil genius, plunges in and rescues her. Subsequently Balduin calls to inquire as to her condition at the castle of her father, the count, but be makes a hurried departure when Baron Waldis arrives, the contrast in their appearance discrediting him. His desire to win the countess and to humiliate the baron becomes so pronounced that he readily accedes to the compact suggested by Scapinelli, the old man, who has so pertinaciously dogged his footsteps, particularly when he learns that untold wealth and power will be his when he assigns to the other the right to take from his room whatever he chooses for his own use as he desires. The agreement is signed. Balduin receives a shower of gold and notes as his portion; Scapinelli takes Balduin\u0027s soul exposed in concrete form by his shadow. Balduin prosecutes his love affair assiduously and with apparent success, till the baron is informed of it by a jealous gypsy girl. He challenges Balduin to a duel, and the latter, assured of his superiority as a fencer, readily agrees. Count Schwarzenberg learns of the impending duel and appeals to Balduin not to kill \"my sister\u0027s child, my daughter\u0027s future husband, and my heir.\" Balduin gives his promise, but when he goes to the venue of the duel he meets, his own counterpart stalking away derisively wiping his gory sword on his cloak. Balduin turns and in the far distance sees the dying victim of the deed he swore he would not do. He rushes from the spot horror-stricken. When he regains sufficient composure he makes his way to the castle of the count, but is refused admission. Determined to explain that he had no complicity in the death of the baron, Balduin climbs into a room in which the countess is seated. She receives him coldly, but soon succumbs to his ardent wooing. Just as he seeks to leave her she notices he has no shadow and that the mirror gives no reflection of him; and she drops back affrighted, the ghastly apparition of himself which takes shape in the corner of the room sends Balduin scuttling away from the castle in a paroxysm of terror. He makes a frenzied flight through a woodland estate and the streets of Prague, but wherever he stops to recover his breath he is haunted by the counterpart of himself. He reaches his rooms and draws a murderous looking fire-arm from its case. As the phantasmagorical figure strides towards him with a sinister grin, he fires, and in a few minutes the blood gushes from his own side from a fatal wound. —Moving Picture World synopsis","tokens":"Performance","total occurrences":"1"},"color":"rgb(169,141,0)","size":20.0},{"label":"They Live","x":-3784.496826171875,"y":1944.646240234375,"id":"tt0096256","attributes":{"Out-Degree":"0","decade":"1980","In-Degree":"2","color":"#616c61","year":"1988","Degree":"2","genres":"Action,Horror,Sci-Fi","country of origin":"United States","Clustering Coefficient":"0.0","description":"Nada, a down-on-his-luck construction worker, discovers a pair of special sunglasses.

When Gordon is taking his girlfriend\u0027s picture in Hong Kong, several Caucasian thugs led by a Chinese man, Kogan, threaten her, so he beats them up. Elsewhere, Bernard Wong pays his workers extra money to continue digging his land after discovering human bones. The thugs are members of the Black Ninja Clan, whose dead are buried on Wong\u0027s site. One of their operatives strangles Gordon\u0027s girlfriend, believing she knows where Gordon has hidden the Golden Ninja statue that apparently gives him power and won\u0027t say, while another hires Ghost Ninja, a beautiful witch dressed in white to kill Wong, his daughter Fanny, her husband George, and her son, Bobo, for three million dollars. Fanny is frightened by a cat in the house upon move-in, and the Black Ninja leader keeps swinging her sword to hallucinate frogs jumping to their deaths out of her refrigerator and her soup ladle turning into a flying snake (strung on a wire that is highly visible without pausing despite being a split-second shot). The witch keeps spooking Fanny and Bobo, who insists on riding his bike in the living room, but George doesn\u0027t believe either of them. Gordon (sitting in front of a poster of a strangled woman marked \"this could happen to you\" and another poster of a swimsuit model) responds to their complaints (in shot-reverse shot, as they\u0027re obviously not in the same film) and commands Magic Chan, a wizard with a magic mirror he has forgotten, and his obese sidekick, Firecracker, in the same manor, and frequently keeps in touch on the phone after his Caucasian operative living next door, Sara, is murdered by a zombie man. Sometimes he uses a black phone, but more often it is a Garfield phone (which the camera moves and music suggest is supposed to be funny). The Ghost Ninja is more interested in her own desires than killing the family, and masturbates to the couple\u0027s lovemaking before spiriting herself into Fanny\u0027s vagina (there is no full-frontal nudity) in order to lure George away from her, though she makes him physically ill, as she did to Bobo by stuffing his mouth full of handfuls of grass. The Ghost Ninja, once compelled by the Black Ninja leader, calls upon more women like dressed her, plus one impersonating Bobo\u0027s grandmother as a lure for him, and the zombie man, in an all-out assault against the family, while the two bumbling idiots (Firecracker and Magic Chan) are having a drinking contest, and Gordon, in a red ninja suit, who has been offing the Caucasian ninjas, prepares to confront Kogan, the Black Ninja leader. —Scott Andrew Hutchins \u003cscottandrewhutchins@yahoo.com\u003e","tokens":"Photography,Sculpture,Performance","total occurrences":"3"},"color":"rgb(192,192,192)","size":20.117130279541016},{"label":"The Legend of Wasco","x":-5688.0888671875,"y":2807.415771484375,"id":"tt5047424","attributes":{"Out-Degree":"0","decade":"2010","In-Degree":"1","color":"#d0d5be","year":"2015","Degree":"1","genres":"Horror","country of origin":"United States","Clustering Coefficient":"0.0","description":"A clown performer and his future brother in-law create a web sensation by dressing up as the infamous Wasco clown and posting pictures on social media.

Five years later, the abandoned Balfour house comes to life again with the arrival of two sinister-looking tenants: a fiendish-looking man with pointed teeth, bulging eyes and a tall beaver hat, and a pale young woman in a long gown. The presence of the strangers prompts Sir James, who lives next door, to call in Inspector Burke again. Also living in the Hamlin household are the other people who were also present in Balfour\u0027s house the night he died: Sir James\u0027 nephew, Arthur Hibbs; the late Balfour\u0027s now-grown daughter, Lucille; and Williams, the butler. Burke expresses skepticism about Sir James\u0027 suspicions that the new neighbors might have been involved in Balfour\u0027s death, until strange things start happening: Balfour\u0027s body disappears from its tomb. The new maid, Smithson, tells a terrifying tale of being menaced in Lucille\u0027s bedroom by the stranger in the beaver hat. And a man spotted inside the Balfour house by Burke and Sir James looks distinctly like the late Roger Balfour. A skittish Arthur becomes convinced the neighbors are vampires. Burke takes Lucille aside, and tells her he doesn\u0027t believe her father committed suicide. He asks her to trust him. Burke also has a private talk with Arthur. Burke uses hypnosis to put Arthur into a trance, but learns nothing new about Balfour\u0027s death. That night, someone fires a shot into Arthur\u0027s room, but Arthur isn\u0027t there; instead, it\u0027s Burke who\u0027s slightly wounded. Lucille is abducted by the beaver-hatted man and the butler and brought to her former home. Sir James, acting at Burke\u0027s instruction, also shows up at the Balfour house; he\u0027s met out front by the beaver-hatted man, who puts him into a hypnotic trance. Arthur breaks into the Balfour house in an attempt to rescue Lucille; he\u0027s caught by Burke and a couple of detectives and locked away. It turns out the man with the beaver hat and pointed teeth was really a disguised Inspector Burke, who was aided at times by a double; Smithson, the maid, is an assistant detective; the mysterious young woman, a stage performer working for the police. Under Burke\u0027s hypnosis, Sir James re-creates his actions the night Roger Balfour died, with Lucille and the butler, Williams, playing themselves, and Burke\u0027s double playing the part of Balfour. It turns out Sir James shot and killed Balfour and made the death appear a suicide after Balfour rejected Sir James as a future husband for young Lucille. Sir James is brought out of his trance and arrested by Burke. The mystery of Balfour\u0027s death solved, Lucille and Arthur, who have come to realize how much they love each other, are now free to marry. —Eugene Kim \u003cgenekim@concentric.net\u003e","tokens":"Create","total occurrences":"1"},"color":"rgb(219,102,230)","size":20.0},{"label":"The H-Man","x":-5874.26171875,"y":3636.739501953125,"id":"tt0051413","attributes":{"Out-Degree":"0","decade":"1950","In-Degree":"1","color":"#7b3b32","year":"1958","Degree":"1","genres":"Crime,Horror,Sci-Fi","country of origin":"Japan","Clustering Coefficient":"0.0","description":"When a narcotics deal goes sour and a suspect disappears, leaving only his clothes, Tokyo police question his wife and stake out the nightclub where she works.

The pact is made, but within a year, the cocky young music producer, demolishes the estate and builds his \"party palace\". On the night of Jack\u0027s house warming party, friends and family party into the early morning, unaware of the \"monstrous spirit\" who returns to murder them one-by-one, until only his grandson is left to destroy.

Those nightmares and his tragic life were many times the basis for his stories and poems; often he found himself in them as the victim or antagonist. Nightmares from the Mind of Poe brings to life those nightmares with Poe as part of the stories, as he often dreamed and wrote them. In the movie, he struggles with nightmares, insomnia, sadness and despair in his own life as he creates his stories. The film includes four of the most well-known tales from Edgar Allan Poe, the master of suspense and horror - \"The Tell-Tale Heart\", \"The Cask of Amontillado\", \"The Premature Burial\" and \"The Raven\"; all of which are word for word the way Poe wrote them, except \"The Premature Burial\" which was adapted from his narrative story. In \"The Tell-Tale Heart\", Poe takes us to the mind of a mad man as he struggles with the thoughts that caused him to do the unthinkable and kill the old man in-trusted to his care. \"The Cask of Amontillado\" is the story of ultimate revenge as Montresor punishes Fortunato for insulting him by walling Montresor behind a stone wall while he is still alive. In \"The Premature Burial\", Poe deals with one of his greatest fears, being buried alive. \"The Raven\", which was written through Poe\u0027s suffering for his dying wife, deals with the dread of death and the \"impending doom\" of losing a loved one. In the end, Poe realizes that out of his nightmares and tragic life would come his legacy, his stories for future generations. —Ric White","tokens":"Create","total occurrences":"1"},"color":"rgb(219,102,230)","size":20.0},{"label":"R-Point","x":-29.512474060058594,"y":-2439.811767578125,"id":"tt0417072","attributes":{"Out-Degree":"0","decade":"2000","In-Degree":"2","color":"#dcd1ca","year":"2004","Degree":"2","genres":"Action,Horror,War","country of origin":"South Korea","Clustering Coefficient":"0.0","description":"On 07 January 1972, the South Korean base in Nah-Trang, Vietnam, receives a radio transmission from a missing platoon presumed dead.

Against all odds, Pearce escaped from the most feared penal settlement of the British Empire - Sarah Island - and disappeared into the impenetrable forests of Western Tasmania. Seven convicts escaped with him, yet Pearce was the only one that emerged... along with chunks of human flesh in his pockets. The legend of Pearce was born. An extinct species... a long forgotten legend... both had a desperate need to survive; both could now have living descendants within the Tasmanian bush. Many sightings of the tiger have been reported. Many hikers have gone missing. Hundreds in fact. Zoologist Nina is convinced there are still tigers remaining in the Tasmanian wilderness, and she has proof - a photograph of a paw print snapped by her sister just before she met with a fatal accident in the bush eight years before. Unable to attain funding for an expedition, Nina fears her wish to finish her sister\u0027s work (and perhaps lay to rest recurrent nightmares she has about her sister\u0027s death) will never happen. Her partner, Matt, manages to persuade an old mate Jack to help finance the trip - at a price. Jack brings along a girlfriend, Rebecca, who uses the trip as an escape from her stifling real estate job. On their quest to find the extinct tiger, the group venture deep into isolated territory and into the domain of \"Pieman\" descendants. \"Sarah\" is a small township that passionately upholds its cannibalistic heritage in honour of the convict patriarch that gave birth to it. It needs to stay hidden to survive... but it also needs fresh \"stock\" to breed. The four hunters become the hunted. —Jody Dwyer","tokens":"Photography","total occurrences":"1"},"color":"rgb(223,70,110)","size":20.0},{"label":"I Spit on Your Grave","x":-12.838044166564941,"y":-1490.08447265625,"id":"tt1242432","attributes":{"Out-Degree":"0","decade":"2010","In-Degree":"3","color":"#d0d5be","year":"2010","Degree":"3","genres":"Horror,Thriller","country of origin":"United States","Clustering Coefficient":"0.0","description":"The writer Jennifer Hills rents an isolated lakeside cabin in the woods of the peaceful Mockingbird Trail for two months to write a novel.

The Princess goes for the locket and finds it has been stolen. Carmencita, her maid, has stolen it and, being jealous of her rival, Juanita, for Jose\u0027s affections, has sold it to Gaines, an American art collector. Juanita, during a fit of jealousy, stabs Carmencita, and Carmencita, on her death bed, tells the Princess and her brother she sold the locket. The Duke D\u0027Alva overhears the conversation and starts in search of it, as does the Princess and her brother. In a southern town a feud has existed between the Jarvis and Markam families, and Markam kills Judge Jarvis. Warren Jarvis, his son, follows Markam to New York. Markam goes along the street and sees the locket brought from Spain by Gaines, the collector, and buys it. The Princess enters and finds the locket has been sold. She starts to find Markam. The Duke enters the store and asks about the locket, and he also starts to find Markam. The Princess gets the locket from Markam, who is at the same hotel that she is staying at. Jarvis, in search of Markam, finds him and kills him. While trying to escape he enters the Princess\u0027 room and tells her the story. Her trunk is nearly packed to go on the boat for her return to Spain. She hides Jarvis in trunk and he is taken on board the boat. In the meantime, Jarvis has telephoned to Rusty, his colored servant, to procure tickets. Two detectives enter and search for Jarvis, but fail to find him. He goes to Spain to help the Princess recover her treasure. Before the Princess goes to America, her father, who enters the castle which is supposed to be haunted, but in reality the ghosts are only the tools of the Duke dressed in armor and as ghosts, is killed by the Duke\u0027s men who also capture her brother and hold him prisoner. Jarvis, upon his arrival in Spain, starts with Rusty, his servant, to explore the castle. While at the inn near the old castle, the Duke steals the locket from the Princess\u0027 bag and tells Robledo, his tool, to keep Jarvis away from the castle. The Princess learns that the locket has been stolen and tells Jarvis. Jarvis starts to go out, when Robledo appears with drawn gun. He and Jarvis both fire. Jarvis seriously wounds Robledo who, on his death bed, tells the Princess about the castle and also about her brother. The brother, who has escaped by diving into the same place where the Duke\u0027s tools killed the Princess\u0027 father, swims the moat and escapes on the horse Jarvis rode to the castle. He notifies the police, who come to the castle. They are about to seize the Duke when he jumps down the trap and is killed. Jarvis and the Princess then each discover a mutual desire to possess the other and the story ends with the pair pledging their troth. —Moving Picture World synopsis","tokens":"Art","total occurrences":"1"},"color":"rgb(10,170,0)","size":20.0},{"label":"Noriko\u0027s Dinner Table","x":-2184.55322265625,"y":379.5918884277344,"id":"tt0468820","attributes":{"Out-Degree":"0","decade":"2000","In-Degree":"3","color":"#dcd1ca","year":"2005","Degree":"3","genres":"Drama,Horror","country of origin":"Japan","Clustering Coefficient":"0.0","description":"A teenager called Noriko Shimabara runs away from her family in Tokoyama, to meet Kumiko, the leader of an Internet BBS, Haikyo.com.

When a member of the party mysteriously disappears, Zandra fears there is a more sinister presence trapped on the island with them.

By weaving through the ethnography of Poe\u0027s dreams and nightmares, particularly the dying moments of himself and his loved ones, a complex plot line of past and present intermingles while Poe hovers near death in his hospital bed. We open with Poe lying unconscious in an alleyway in Baltimore. It is October 3, 1849 and the Congressional elections have just ended, and Poe has been discarded into the alley, after being used by a press gang to cast multiple false ballots for a crooked political campaign. Poe is discovered by his cousin Neilson and brought to Washington College Hospital where he remains until his death five days later, which is the focus of the story. In the hospital, Poe floats in and out of consciousness. Various visual cues transport Poe to intense moments in his past which inspired many of his phantasmagorical stories. There is always a connection made between the writing and the experience. For example when Poe\u0027s bride Virginia ruptures a throat vessel while playing a harp, The voice-over from Poe\u0027s sorrowful \"Annabel Lee\" underscores. Poe\u0027s first impressions of life are those as a backstage theater baby. Young Poe watches in horror as his Mother commits suicide on stage, establishing Poe\u0027s and the script\u0027s leitmotif of [all that we see or seem is but a dream within a dream]. The sub theme of reincarnation plays an important part of the film, as part of the story takes place in modern times where the actor playing Poe in a stage production begins to experience unusual psychic connections to the past, and characters from Poe\u0027s life appear in a Jacob\u0027s ladder like ripping of reality, causing the actor to lose his sense of self and reality and the veil rends as to who is the real Poe and who is the actor, as both call to each other through the timeless space of consciousness. The mystery reaches a climax with Poe\u0027s wife\u0027s death timed in sequence with his own demise. (He experienced the death of his Mother, his foster Mother, his foster Father, his first love, his brother, and his wife (all to consumption). Throughout the film, there is a subtle theme of repressed sensuality, that Poe\u0027s own emotionally, immature sexuality manifests. —brent fidler","tokens":"Writing,Painting","total occurrences":"2"},"color":"rgb(192,192,192)","size":20.058565139770508},{"label":"30 Monedas","x":1836.1514892578125,"y":-4166.9248046875,"id":"tt3604740","attributes":{"Out-Degree":"0","decade":"2010","In-Degree":"1","color":"#d0d5be","year":"2014","Degree":"1","genres":"Drama,Horror,Mystery","country of origin":"Spain","Clustering Coefficient":"0.0","description":"A filmmaker watches his savings disappear on a failed project and loses his house.

He lives in Mallou, a decaying and abandoned small village in the middle of the mountains, along with his parents and his dearest pig, Martiño. It\u0027s been a long time since the last time he spoke. Something happened when he was a child that shut him up for good.Jacinto spends his days playing in the woods, going to church on Sundays, watching old vampire movies and visiting his secret spot: an abandoned Seat 127 hidden in the mountain. His mother, Maruja, adores him and makes sure he has everything he needs. His Father, Amancio, is a retired legionnaire that wants to maintain the discipline at home. And Millan, his younger brother, left the village to live in town some years ago, and only comes back when he is looking for money. They are the Becerra family.Jacinto\u0027s world is turned upside down when two new neighbors arrive at the village: Alex and Ana, two black metal artists that arrive from Sweden looking for a peaceful place to record the new album for their band, \"Tardigrades\". Someplace free from distractions. Alex comes from a galician family, and they occupy the house that belonged to her grandmother. Soon they become friends with Maruja, that is excited to see new faces in the area. Jacinto, however, having seen so many vampire films, is convinced the girls are vampires and will bring disgrace to his family. Amancio, that still has an antiquated mentality, can\u0027t understand what two girls are doing living together, and doesn\u0027t approve of the new neighbors. Both families have to face also an important language barrier and some cultural differences that don\u0027t ease the situation.The Swedes refurbish the old house to make it livable, and Alex takes advantage of the situation to record some videos for her Youtube channel, talking about survivalism and rural life. She becomes every day more obsessed with succeeding as a youtuber, and she starts forgetting about music. This becomes a problem between her and Ana. In the meanwhile, Martiño, Jacinto\u0027s pig, is becoming a grown-up. Slaughtering time is close, and Jacinto releases him to save him from the knife. His heroism gets him beaten by his father and, in the end, is useless. The Swedes find Martiño by chance and get him back to Amancio, that starts liking the girls much better. Jacinto, on the other side, ensures that they are the Devil himself.Jacinto has enough reasons to hate the newcomers. They don\u0027t know it, but everything they do has fatal consequences to the poor guy. They capture Martiño and foil its escape from being killed. They also destroy Jacinto\u0027s secret spot when they mistake it for some junk.

The communal forest is their main source of income, and they are not willing to share it with some \"outlanders\". Amancio, who has a life-threatening heart condition, suffers a heart attack while arguing with the girls, and dies instantly. Jacinto and Maruja can\u0027t help but blaming them for his death.With Amancio dead, Millán comes back to Mallou willing to be the man of the house, inherit his parents\u0027 estate and convince the girls to give up about sharing the money. He has too many debts from gambling and drugs and needs fresh money as soon as possible.  However, neither Maruja nor the Swedes want to be guided by him. Millán, angry and crazed by the drugs and the lack of scruples, decides to undertake an insane plan: killing his own mother, convincing Jacinto that it was the girls who did it and use his fears about vampires to make him avenge Maruja and kill the girls.The plan seems to work. Millán drowns his mother at the laundry. The authorities are confident that it is a suicide, but during the wake, Millán convinces Jacinto that all their fantasies are true: the swedes are not but vampires, and they are guilty of their parents\u0027 deaths. If he wants to become the family hero, he has to hide behind a mask and kill them. Jacinto, encouraged by his brother\u0027s words, succeeds at killing Ana, but faints at the sight of blood. Millán disappears during the wake to assassinate Alex before she runs out and ruins his plan. When the time is right to hide the corpses, Jacinto faces his brother. The traumatic experience he has just lived make him lose his innocence. He is not a child any more, he speaks again and is unwilling to be led by anyone.

He then brutally hacks up the young woman with a pair of scissors. Miguel is institutionalized at a mental asylum for five years. Afterward, he is released into the care of his sister, Manuela. Along with their wheelchair bound mother, they operate a boarding school for young woman, called Europe\u0027s International Youth-Club Boarding School of Languages, on the Spanish resort of Costa Del Sol. Miguel is intrigued by Angela, a long-haired brunette, whom he first saw on the train ride from the sanitarium. The creepy Miguel follows her around. Miguel meets with Manuela to request that they resume their incestuous relationship. She reminds him that it was this relationship that made him emotionally unstable five years earlier. She says they cannot because nobody understands them: \"Only if we could get rid of everyone, then things could go back to the way they were.\" Then Angela\u0027s friends are killed one by one. One, while topless, is skewered from behind by a 12-inch knife that exits her right nipple. Another is coerced by a romantic masked Spaniard who insists on tying her up in an abandoned lumber mill (which according to her is \"kinky,\" but OK) and is decapitated quite nicely with a large power saw, complete with squirting blood from her neck. A young boy is run over mid-section by a Mercedes. Another friend is strangled by smoldering fireplace tongs. There is also the real decapitation of a snake. When the girls start to turn up missing, nobody believes Angela that there\u0027s a killer on the loose. She had seen the corpse of one girl, and it was gone as soon as she went for help.

One night, while preparing to record a demo, the girls started to hear the creepy laughter. Next morning, when they replay the recording, they discover that the laughter was also captured in the background of the song. Thinking it would not really matter, they decided to upload it on YouTube and unexpectedly, the song becomes a runaway hit. Feeling great about their hit song they decided to compose another song. Unfortunately, the second song flops even though it is a great song. The girls try again with a third song but it also flops despite having a more developed sound. In frustration, the girls brainstorm on why their first song was such a big hit while their subsequent songs bombed. They realized that it was the creepy laughter that made their song a hit and that it came from a Langsuir. After much contemplation, they decided to look for the Langsuir. After searching hi and low, they decided to go back to their flat. On the way back, they took a wrong turn and stumbled upon the Langsuir at an old shack. With a pull of courage they decide to ask for the Langsuir\u0027s help. The Langsuir, after hearing their request, surprisingly agrees to have her laughter recorded. Her only stipulation is that if the songs they record with her voice become hits, she will seek them out for her payment...the girls with much hesitation agreed.

A horror film where the cream of the crop of the Dutch film world had been working on. It was one of the biggest films of the year, won prizes at international film festivals, was released worldwide and even managed to acquire a cult status in the US. But few people know the history of the film and that it is actually a miracle that it has ever been made. The Johnsons was originally a collaborative effort of an American film writing duo. The script they wrote was a black comedy horror which can be best described as a mix of Deliverance meets Crocodile Dundee. The film never got off the ground. From there the script made its way to the Netherlands and into the hands of a Dutch production team. They saw something in the story, something that was unique for their country. They hired a director that had proved himself in making black comedy blockbusters. But it turned out he was impossible to work with. So much that he got fired three weeks before shooting the film. The project was shut down. There was no one to take over the job so the producers turned to an old friend, best known for documentaries and art-house dramas. He got carte blanche and rewrote the whole thing. The dark humor disappeared and in its place came an anthropological structure with a supernatural myth and an underlying coming of age story. Genre experts still find it the scariest and best horror film the Dutch soil has to offer, but many others still look down on it. Xangadix Lives. as a documentary doesn\u0027t only dives in the peculiar history of the Johnsons, but also shows that it is indeed an important film that has influenced and still influences people to this very day.

A company called Zomcon has been able to control the zombie population. Zombies can be temporarily neutralized by being shot, but can only be permanently neutralized by their brain being destroyed. Their ultimate disposal is through cremation, or burial, the latter which requires decapitation with the head being buried separately from the body. Conversely, Zomcon has created the domestication collar, when activated and placed on a zombie makes the zombie controllable, and thus an eternally productive creature within society. Because all dead initially become zombies, the elderly are viewed negatively and suspectly. And all people, adult or child, learn to shoot to kill to protect society. Zomcon is the go to organization for all things zombie. In the town of Willard, the Robinsons - father Bill (Dylan Baker), mother Helen (Carrie-Anne Moss), and adolescent son Timmy (Kesun Loder) - are one family who don\u0027t own a zombie as a domestic, since Bill is afraid of zombies, as, when he was a child, he had to shoot his own zombie father, who tried to eat him. Bill has thus become fascinated with funerals to see zombies put away permanently. But Helen feels pressured to get a zombie when Zomcon\u0027s new head of security in Willard, the officious Jonathan Bottoms (Henry Czerny), moves into the neighborhood with his family. Never having had to deal with a zombie directly, Timmy is initially wary of their zombie. But as a lonely child who has no friends and is often bullied, Timmy eventually befriends their zombie, who he names Fido (Sir Billy Connolly), as he treats the zombie much like a faithful pet dog. Timmy protects Fido at all cost, even after Fido, due to no fault of its own, is implicated in some deaths, which creates a mini-wave of loose zombies unknown to Zomcon. But Fido may play a larger role within the family as a companion for Helen, who is largely neglected by Bill, since he sees human affection as ultimately resulting in such difficult issues as what happened between him and his own father. With Timmy and Helen treating Fido with kindness, Fido, in turn, may prove that not all zombies, even when without their domestication collar, are out to kill anyone and everyone in their path. —Huggo","tokens":"Create","total occurrences":"1"},"color":"rgb(219,102,230)","size":20.0},{"label":"I rec u","x":234.05384826660156,"y":-3451.18701171875,"id":"tt2773034","attributes":{"Out-Degree":"0","decade":"2010","In-Degree":"2","color":"#d0d5be","year":"2012","Degree":"2","genres":"Comedy,Fantasy,Horror","country of origin":"Italy","Clustering Coefficient":"0.0","description":"Neve, 19 years old, suffers from a unique eye disease: he sees all women out of focus.

He\u0027s out for revenge on a \"clique\" of four vampires who are traveling across country in search of \"pure blood.\" The human blood stream has become polluted by drugs, alcohol, Aids, Diabetes, anti-depressants, cigarettes, anything that changes the blood even a small amount makes it undrinkable for Vampires, who, like hi-performance automobiles need \"hi test\" fuel\u003d Blood in order to survive. This has started a sort of underground civil war between various groups of vampires and vampires themselves have mutated due to the pollution of their life blood. Live Evil is what is written on playing cards left behind on the bodies of dead vampires that this mysterious Priest/Hunter leaves in his wake as he gets closer and closer to our main group of vampires. He\u0027s out for revenge and the real reason for this is not revealed until the very end. He\u0027s as cold blooded or more than the vampire he seeks, because he has to be. The Leader of the group of Vampires is Benedict, the \"oldest\u0027 of the group he\u0027s seen the rise and fall of the vampires and is out to protect his small family of vampires. He\u0027s also in love with one of the two females in his group, Sydney. Sydney is a sexy but equally ravenous vampire who is becoming more and more out of control. Yael is the youngest of the group and the most enthusiastic and inexperienced, of these vampires; her recklessness could threaten their group\u0027s existence. Also part of the group is the acerbic Baxter, an Irish former silent movie star, who became a vampire in order to stay young forever only to have his career ruined when sound films came in. His bitterness and Yael\u0027s young enthusiasm create more tension for Benedict to try to control. This clique is constantly trying to find pure bloods for food and also on the run from The Priest who gets closer and closer to them with every mile as they travel to Los Angeles to find a Blood Dealer, Max, a man who \"pushes\" blood stolen from hospitals to vampire clients. In a wild opening sequence car chase the Priest\u0027s car flips over and his right leg is injured so severely that he must hijack a ride from Roxy. A tough woman who doesn\u0027t know if the Priest is just insane or if there really are vampires. As the two grudging companions get to know each other The Priest learns that Roxy is a \"pure blood\" and realizes that he must do more than just seek revenge, he must not care for another human being for the first time in his life. Neither Vampires, nor Vampire Hunter Priest take prisoners in this increasingly frenzied cat and mouse game.

Culture shock seems to be the least of the group\u0027s worries as they get to know more of the people from the sleepy little town, but once they get to the forest, everything begins to fall into place.

As they fight for their very survival, unexpected twists further complicate matters, leading to an ending that is as shocking as it is disturbing.

These interpretations are woven through the relationships of three people, a gunshot victim(James Higginson), a woman(Marie Larizza) and her daughter(Morgane Kelly).WILLFUL BLINDNESS is a mesmerizing story of a man as he crawls home after being shot, a story of a mother supporting her daughter and a story of a daughter who has been a passive recipient of the fruits of evil. On the films surface, the man reflects on what has brought him to this moment and to his relationships, on a deeper level, the film questions the materialistic, imperialistic and self-centered values of our time.A nonlinear, circuitous story that borders stream of consciousness, an expansive abstract journey that harvests the memories and fuses the projections of the subconscious, WILLFUL BLINDNESS is a film respectful of and referential to film history yet dwells on the edge of a dreamscape. This non-verbal experimental art film is a bold and stunning visual interpretation that pivots on the struggle of trying, a kaleidoscopic rollercoaster ride through the madness of the mores that consume our contemporary society.

High school senior Carrie White is a social outcast, largely due to being unwise to the ways of the world based on her upbringing. Her mother, Margaret White, is a religious fanatic, her extreme views primarily targeted against sex, which she believes is a sin. She even believes natural associated processes such as menstruation are a sin, about which she has refused to mention to Carrie. Mrs. White\u0027s beliefs were taken to that extreme largely because of her own failed marriage and her husband Ralph long ago having run off with another woman. The only adult authority figure who tries to help Carrie with her life is her phys ed teacher, Miss Collins, who is nonetheless warned not to get too close to go against how Mrs. White chooses to raise Carrie, Mrs. White whose beliefs are well known in the community. An impromptu event that happens among Carrie\u0027s phys ed classmates against her leads to her classmates being punished. One of those students, self absorbed Chris Hargensen, vows revenge against Carrie for that punishment, the method of the revenge associated to the phys ed class incident. Another student however, the popular Sue Snell, begins to feel sorry for Carrie. In wanting to help her get out of her shell, Sue asks her boyfriend, the equally popular Tommy Ross, to take Carrie to the senior prom instead of her. This move does not sit well with Mrs. White, who in her extreme view believes Carrie will fall prey to sin. All these competing issues lead to Carrie deciding on an impulse to use a newfound skill to free herself from the figurative chains that have long been placed around her, with tragic consequences. —Huggo","tokens":"Performance","total occurrences":"1"},"color":"rgb(169,141,0)","size":20.0},{"label":"Less Than a Whisper","x":1318.759765625,"y":5375.91748046875,"id":"tt2402673","attributes":{"Out-Degree":"0","decade":"2010","In-Degree":"3","color":"#d0d5be","year":"2015","Degree":"3","genres":"Drama,Horror,Mystery","country of origin":"United States","Clustering Coefficient":"0.0","description":"Robert and Taylor Usher expect to be happy in their new house in Northridge, California where years ago, murder and mutilations destroyed the former residents.

Camiel scrapes out with some difficulty, hitching a ride with a doomed truck driver on a relentless trip to the heart of suburbia. He passes by two odd women, Brenda and Ilonka, with whom he seems to share a history. When a dirty Camiel arrives at the door of artist Marina and media executive Richard\u0027s expansive, designer-chic home, the shifting perceptions of Van Warmerdam\u0027s screenplay begin to displace and disorient the audience.

Cornish), Louise and John plan their futures in pursuit of a formula to restore life to the dead. Bob and Louise wish to remain independent and pursue medical research free of corporate ties. John tries in vain to convince them that by joining him to work at Arnold Research Laboratories they could achieve more research in a year than they could in five as an independent research team. John leaves his friends for corporate pharmacology only to find the pace of his research is not progressing fast enough nor seems practical enough to suit Mr. Arnold. The final blow comes when he is told to turn his attention to creating a treated pig bristle brush to restore hair and prop up his bosses investments in pig processing. Disillusioned Dr. John Kendrick faces public ridicule as he promotes his theory to his peers and falls into a deep depression that costs him his private medical practice. Five years later the sudden passing of his wife, drives in into a paralytic depression and loses custody of his only son, Danny. Danny runs away with his dog scooter in tow to avoid being a ward of the state and hoping to return to life with his father. Danny is befriended by an east-side gang and allowed to stay in their club house with Scooter serving as watch dog. The gang tries to help Danny get his dad a job but the best they can come up with is as an elevator operator in a research lab. When his dad turns the job down, Danny takes it as a sign that his father is unwilling to get back to a state of normalcy and regain custody. Meanwhile Louise and Bob continue their research on life after death when they learn of John\u0027s fate from his former boss at Arnold Research. Louise visits John to share the success of Dr. Bob Cornish\u0027s own research. John takes this as ridicule and drives her off with self-righteous indignation. Danny\u0027s dog scooter is captured by the dog catcher and the gang tries to spring all the dogs to cover a rescue attempt. Danny and Scooter are caught but Danny gets away only to find one of his friends has broken a leg while running from the pound. Afraid to go home to his father, the injured boy is taken to the clubhouse and Danny enlists his father to help. Dr. John is too far gone and refuses to treat the boy, leaving the gang to think Danny has lie about his father being a great doctor. Danny begins to doubt his father himself when he learns that Scooter is being gassed by the dog catcher in retaliation for the rescue attempt. Danny again implores his dad to help revive Scooter to no avail. Danny runs away again vowing he no longer wishes to see his father. Upon reflection of how he has let down himself and Danny, Dr. John collects Scooters body and enlists the help of Dr. Bob Cornish and his team to revive him. The gang brings in their dogs as blood donors to create the resuscitation fluid. The gang then find Danny on the verge of jumping out a window in despair. What follows is purported to be an actual reanimation sequence performed by the real Dr. Robert Cornish and his team*. The result restores the faith of Dr. John in science and Danny in his father. *The story opens with a signed affidavit as follows: TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN: The actual experiment of bringing the dead back to life, which is part of the motion picture \"Life Returns\" was performed by myself and staff on May 22, 1934 at 11:45 P.M. in Berkeley, California.

She came across the work of Cassandra Sechler, director of \"Wireboy\" and leader of Dreams For Dead Cats productions, and thought it would be fun to combine forces for a feature film. Though both have a distinct style, Heidi and Cassandra both love 70\u0027s and 80\u0027s horror films, trash \u0026 cult cinema, low budget filmmaking, and practical fx, so it comes as no surprise that a collaborative effort is in the works for them. Dolly Deadly is sure to be a little creepy, a bit silly, and a lot of fun (think Troma meets John Waters). The story of Dolly Deadly revolves around the warped psychology of a tormented young boy who can only relate to his doll collection, and the only relief from the pain in his life comes with slaughtering those he has learned to hate the most. Everyone in his trailer park! The film is to be a whirlwind of vengeful deaths, elaborate dream sequences, and crazy characters.

Hutter\u0027s trek is an unusual one, with many locals not wanting to take him near the castle where strange events have been occurring. Once at the castle, Hutter does manage to sell the Count the house, but he also notices and feels unusual occurrences, primarily feeling like there is a dark shadow hanging over him, even in the daytime when the Count is unusually asleep. Hutter eventually sees the Count\u0027s sleeping chamber in a crypt, and based on a book he has recently read, believes the Count is really a vampire or Nosferatu. While Hutter is trapped in the castle, the Count, hiding in a shipment of coffins, makes his way to Wisbourg, causing death along his way, which most attribute to the plague.

The future. Renowned photojournalist JENNIFER PRESTON is investigating the aftermath of a terrible explosion that ripped through the city on New Year\u0027s Eve. Known simply as \u0027The Catastrophe\u0027, this shocking tragedy has left behind a festering wound. The city is on edge, thousands have evacuated and a sprawling, militarized Quarantine Zone has been erected around the epicentre of the blast. The \u0027QZ\u0027, as it becomes known, is a network of empty buildings and abandoned streets, shrouded beneath clinical plastic and fenced in behind impenetrable barricades. Heavily armed security units ensure that nobody goes in and nobody comes out. As unexplained and increasingly bizarre acts of violence erupt across the city, Jennifer begins to notice strange, ephemeral phantoms in her photographs. What begins as an artistic documentation of The Catastrophe\u0027s lingering aftershock soon becomes an obsession with \u0027The Phenomenon\u0027 - a seeming paranormal phenomenon gripping the perimeter of the Quarantine Zone. Jennifer slowly but surely becomes convinced that The Catastrophe and The Phenomenon she is uncovering are not disconnected. And when her theories eventually incite interest, not all of which are welcome, Jennifer learns that the reality is more complex, and dangerous, than even she imagined.

Berdella was also notable for his work mentoring troubled youths, and was even assigned as the probation officer to many of these teens.

His shop was setup like any normal flea market, but his taste of goods were different than the rest of the merchants at Westport Flea Market. Bob had real human skulls, witchcraft and occult books, jewelry, knives and swords, and practically anything that would be classified as bizarre. Berdella, after his arrest, was known for keeping precise notes on his torture and killing methods. Investigators found these notebooks under his mattress with over 1,000 Polaroid pictures taken of his victims at various stages of their torture.

Sundance/Cannes filmmaker Mike Costanza helped pave the way for films such as PARANORMAL ACTIVITY, HOST, AND UNFRIENDED. THE COLLINGSWOOD STORY stars Stephanie Dees (HALLOWEEN IV), Johnny Burton, Grant Edmonds, and Diane Behrens (GAS FOOD LODGING, BIG LOVE, MONEYBALL.). COLLINGSWOOD screened at festivals including Frightfest in London and The Fearless Tales Film Festival in San Francisco and won the Best Cast and Best Indie Film Awards.","tokens":"Create,Performance","total occurrences":"2"},"color":"rgb(192,192,192)","size":20.058565139770508},{"label":"The Invisible Man vs. The Human Fly","x":1115.171875,"y":-2911.7080078125,"id":"tt0204691","attributes":{"Out-Degree":"0","decade":"1950","In-Degree":"1","color":"#7b3b32","year":"1957","Degree":"1","genres":"Crime,Fantasy,Horror","country of origin":"Japan","Clustering Coefficient":"0.0","description":"A ruthless serial killer with a peculiar method of stalking and killing his victims comes face to face with a police officer turned invisible by a scientific experiment.

To hunt for ghosts. They found what they were looking for. And now the school in the woods is going to teach them a lesson in fear.

When his girlfriend Elizabeth Williams returns to the island after spending six months in New York, a bizarre series of events begin to occur, including several gruesome deaths and the presence of a mysterious fog. When Elizabeth slips in Nick\u0027s boathouse and falls into the sea, she finds an old journal from 1871, written by Patrick Malone, one of the town\u0027s founders. It tells how a man named Blake bought half the island for use as a leper colony. While bringing his people to Antonio Island in their clipper ship, the Elizabeth Dane, Blake is betrayed by Castle, Wayne, Williams and Malone. The four men locked Blake and his people in the vessel, stole their money and possessions, and then set fire to the ship, killing everyone aboard.

Lawrence is excited to have his baby sister living close again. Lena is hopeful this could be the move that helps her bury the past. As she settles into another new apartment she quickly becomes very close with her neighbor, Toni Crawford. Toni is a 27 year old flamboyant, transitioning gay male who is thrilled to have someone new in his phone that can be introduced to Los Angeles with him as tour guide to the good and the unsavory. Through her new job position Lena meets a 32 year old African American business owner and motivational speaker, Scotty Sharpe. Scotty sweeps Lena off her feet from moment one. It\u0027s not long before the two are lovers and everything in her life for the first time in a very long time is good. She\u0027s even able to sleep at night, most nights, without waking in a cold sweat. The last time Lena approached this feeling was two years prior. She was ready to trust again until she caught her man cheating with a white woman named Kelly in their bed. While out with Toni, Lena spots Scotty with another woman, a white woman. Scotty and the lady are having drinks together at a restaurant/bar. Lena confronts the two and without giving Scotty time to explain she walks away breaking it off between them. The woman Scotty is with is a real estate agent. He\u0027s trying secure a property for Lena as a surprise to help her achieve another business dream. He tried telling her that but in a split second Lena\u0027s perception became her reality. A reality with soon to be deadly and regrettable consequences. \"Why get over it, when you can get it back!\" - Toni Crawford Toni introduces Lena to a world she is unprepared for and shocked he knows anything about, let alone practices - voodoo and his priestess, MaMa Ti\u0027Mun. Lena is reluctant at first but desperation wins over. As angry as she is at Scotty she doesn\u0027t want to lose out to another woman again. Consequences be damned - and they will be. Lena follows the instruction given by MaMa and after Scotty accepts her invitation for an \"I\u0027m sorry\" dinner, Lena makes his favorite meal, Spaghetti but after feeding her man a plate of pasta and tomato sauce mixed with voodoo spells and minstrel blood he\u0027s no longer the reason she sleeps peacefully at night, he\u0027s the reason she can no longer close her eyes. —Markice Moore","tokens":"Create","total occurrences":"1"},"color":"rgb(219,102,230)","size":20.0},{"label":"Monsters in the Woods","x":898.8442993164062,"y":-2763.763671875,"id":"tt1686902","attributes":{"Out-Degree":"0","decade":"2010","In-Degree":"1","color":"#d0d5be","year":"2012","Degree":"1","genres":"Horror","country of origin":"United States","Clustering Coefficient":"0.0","description":"Low budget filmmaker, Jayson has made the movie of his dreams... but to his dismay, it can\u0027t sell in Hollywood.

With only the company of the recently departed and an ailing widow who expresses cryptic reservations as to the man\u0027s ability to carry out the task, he soon finds himself exposed to a terrifying haunting within the claustrophobic confines of a home that has become host to a malevolent entity. In what is essentially a one-man show, Dave Davis is profoundly affecting in his portrayal of the hesitant sentinel, exuding an empathetic combination of frayed nerves and timid weariness. Throughout this uncanny night, his vigil gradually transforms into a harrowing spiritual investigation of both his cursed surroundings and his pitiable past - a journey in which the very recesses of his community\u0027s collective trauma is confronted. By the surreal and unnerving climax, under the assured auspices of writer-director Keith Thomas - making his feature film debut - the plentiful, hair-raising scares give way to poignant catharsis with a specter of dread that is sure to stick with audiences and occupy their subsequent nightmares. Operating within the parameters of a horror sub-genre that more commonly trades in Christian mysticism, The Vigil uniquely unveils a supernatural domain less trodden.

The words take on even more provocative implications as the title of Jeff Barnaby\u0027s sophomore feature, which grimly depicts an apocalyptic scenario where in an isolated \"Mi\u0027gmaq\" community discover they are the only humans immune to a zombie plague. As the citizens of surrounding cities flee to the \"Mi\u0027gmaq\" reserve in search of refuge from the outbreak, the community must reckon with whether to let the outsiders in - and thus risk not just the extinction of their tribe but of humanity, period. The severe and scathing portrait of post-colonial Indigenous life and culture that Barnaby previously captured in the acclaimed Rhymes for Young Ghouls here deftly collides with the iconography and violent hyperbole typical of the zombie genre. The Undead are spectacularly and gruesomely dispatched via samurai swords, chainsaws, shotguns, and makeshift axes, while the living - a terrific ensemble cast led by Michael Greyeyes (Woman Walks Ahead and Fear the Walking Dead) - endure the paranoid pressures that such dire straits foment. In this iteration, however, Barnaby takes full advantage of the canvas zombie films regularly afford for cultural critique, exploring racism, colonialism, and the very real threat of extinction that Indigenous communities have experienced for generations. Further accentuated by arresting animated chapter breaks that instill a cool comic-book aesthetic to its horrific proceedings, Blood Quantum is as powerful an entry into the annals of zombie cinema as the devastating conclusion to George Romero\u0027s 1968 original Night of the Living Dead, and a meaningful demonstration of how marginalized voices - when given the opportunity - can resurrect a tired genre with incendiary new life. —Toronto International Film Festival","tokens":"Painting","total occurrences":"1"},"color":"rgb(70,125,189)","size":20.0},{"label":"Deimosimine","x":-5873.03076171875,"y":4751.23828125,"id":"tt4622666","attributes":{"Out-Degree":"0","decade":"2010","In-Degree":"1","color":"#d0d5be","year":"2017","Degree":"1","genres":"Horror","country of origin":"United States","Clustering Coefficient":"0.0","description":"A heroin addict undergoes a radical new kind of treatment for her condition; but the drug \u0027Deimosimine\u0027 instead creates for her a world of horror and blood.

Now charged with the hospice care of Amanda, a retired dancer ravaged by cancer, Maud\u0027s fervent faith quickly inspires an obsessive conviction that she must save her ward\u0027s soul from eternal damnation - whatever the cost. Making her feature-film debut, writer/director Rose Glass cannily lures the audience into this disturbed psyche, steadily setting up her veritable diary of a country nurse for an unnerving and ultimately shocking trajectory. Morfydd Clark (also at the Festival in The Personal History of David Copperfield) portrays the sanctimonious Maud with an intense stoicism that belies a disquieting vulnerability, as Maud desperately vies for absolution and solidarity from her embittered patient (an enthralling Jennifer Ehle, also at the Festival in Beneath the Blue Suburban Skies). Glass tenderly captures this relationship with an empathetic gaze that first assumes an ethereal, dreamlike atmosphere - but it isn\u0027t long before Maud\u0027s dogmatic candor incites an irreconcilable friction that spirals her mind into a suffocating confluence of creeping doubt and paranoia. As Glass tightens the screws on her misguided martyr, well-placed nods are made to religious horror forerunners like William Friedkin\u0027s The Exorcist, further contributing to the film\u0027s increasingly dread-filled malaise. And when this insidious fever climatically breaks, the consequences are devastating and terrifying in equal measure. —Toronto International Film Festival","tokens":"Writing,Performance","total occurrences":"2"},"color":"rgb(192,192,192)","size":20.058565139770508},{"label":"Slender Man","x":-6195.52001953125,"y":3919.17236328125,"id":"tt5690360","attributes":{"Out-Degree":"0","decade":"2010","In-Degree":"1","color":"#d0d5be","year":"2018","Degree":"1","genres":"Horror,Mystery,Thriller","country of origin":"United States","Clustering Coefficient":"0.0","description":"When their friend mysteriously disappears, a group of teenage girls explore whether the culprit could be the creepy internet urban legend character Slenderman by summoning him with a ritual.

Francis, the team behind the commercially unsuccessful Zombie Night 1 and 2, have found the climate for Zombie movies has changed significantly after the \"real\" zombie invasion begins. Hedging on the fact that the Zombie mayhem that has taken a grip on the nation is only a temporary problem, the film makers realize that once normalcy has returned, demand for Zombie product (now outlawed) will be at an all time high. The filmmakers seize an opportunity to do something they were never able to before on their meager budgets, make a memorable zombie film. This time, however, through using real zombies, the film will have an authenticity and production value previously unattainable. They set about \"bringing the gang back together\" and assemble several key cast and crew members from their past productions (the ones that aren\u0027t already dead). With a full crew and a documentarian following them all the way, Masters and Francis embark on the production of their masterpiece. Film production at the best of time is wrought with peril, and for these intrepid film makers, it is no different this time around. From the challenges of safely shooting with and wrangling the hoards of untrained zombies to creative differences over what the film is ultimately to be about - the filmmakers face new challenges and production gets more precarious at every step. The entire process is documented, complete with interviews, behind the scenes footage of production meetings and shooting challenges, as the filmmakers struggle with cast and crew being eaten by their hungry zombie extras. A lack of resources to finish the film, and an increasingly high level of zombie activity cause them to reconsider their previous notion that \"things will soon be back to normal.\" Despite it all, the filmmakers\u0027 resolve to finish the film at all costs leads them down some dangerous paths, and forcing them to make some difficult creative choices to keep the cameras rolling at all times. It\u0027s all the challenges of shooting a low budget zombie film, mixed with the perils of surviving in a Zombie infested world. Will they finish the film and get their long deserved accolades as pioneers in the Zombie film industry, or will the making of documentary be all that\u0027s left of their attempts to bring something innovative, fresh and devastatingly real to the screen? —Anonymous","tokens":"Performance","total occurrences":"1"},"color":"rgb(169,141,0)","size":20.0},{"label":"The Evil Eye","x":1963.325927734375,"y":7364.25048828125,"id":"tt0057443","attributes":{"Out-Degree":"0","decade":"1960","In-Degree":"1","color":"#8b6b57","year":"1963","Degree":"1","genres":"Horror,Mystery,Thriller","country of origin":"Italy","Clustering Coefficient":"0.0","description":"Nora is a young tourist traveling through Rome which takes a sudden turn when she witnesses a murder by a serial killer that the police have sought for years for the so-called Alphabet Killings, and Nora soon finds herself in way-over-her-head trouble when the police want her cooperation to catch the killer while the mystery killer soon targets her for his next victim. —Anonymous","tokens":"Writing","total occurrences":"1"},"color":"rgb(255,88,10)","size":20.0},{"label":"Fatal Frame","x":-1213.715087890625,"y":-2933.73828125,"id":"tt3684484","attributes":{"Out-Degree":"0","decade":"2010","In-Degree":"2","color":"#d0d5be","year":"2014","Degree":"2","genres":"Horror","country of origin":"Japan","Clustering Coefficient":"0.0","description":"Michi a student in a conservative all-girls school, must resolve the mysterious disappearances and deaths of her fellow classmates after they found an intriguing but haunting photo of Aya, the best singer of class, who apparently is being held locked in her room, physically but not spiritually...

Two weeks later, with Lazarus now a missing person, his heart-sick fiancee Bethany Loomis (Natalie Victoria, Dead Head) and Chip (Kevin Eugene Franklin) undertake the task of finding him.

The correspondence includes a photograph of Rowan. Upon his arrival on Summerisle, Howie finds that the locals are a seemingly simple minded lot who provide little information beyond the fact that they know of no Rowan Morrison and do not know the girl in the photo. Mrs. Morrison admits to having a daughter, seven year old Myrtle, but no Rowan. As Howie speaks to more and more people, he begins to believe that Rowan does or did live on the island, but that the locals are hiding their knowledge of her. He also begins to see that the locals all have pagan beliefs, their \"religion\" which centers on procreation as the source of life. That procreation does not necessarily need to be within marriage, and openly flaunts the act of sex, both in private and in public. These beliefs do not sit well against Howie\u0027s strict Christian morals, he who regularly attends church, prays, and accepts communion. Everything that happens on the island seems to be dictated by Lord Summerisle, whose ancestors bought the island generations ago. Howie begins to believe that Rowan was murdered, she a sacrifice by the islanders to their higher power to ensure a bountiful apple crop - the main crop of the island - which did not materialize last season. With May Day approaching, Howie not only tries to find out if Rowan was indeed murdered/sacrificed, which includes trying to locate her body, but if there will be another sacrifice on this important day within the cycle of life. —Huggo","tokens":"Photography,Sculpture","total occurrences":"2"},"color":"rgb(192,192,192)","size":20.058565139770508},{"label":"The Final Storm","x":-6176.60400390625,"y":2967.54052734375,"id":"tt1331329","attributes":{"Out-Degree":"0","decade":"2010","In-Degree":"1","color":"#d0d5be","year":"2010","Degree":"1","genres":"Action,Horror,Thriller","country of origin":"Canada,Germany","Clustering Coefficient":"0.0","description":"A stranger named Silas flees from a devastating storm and finds refuge with Tom and Gillian on their farm.
