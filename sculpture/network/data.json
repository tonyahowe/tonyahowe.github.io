Below they are listed by their real Italian names.**Muriel Hampton Arrowsmith (Barbara Steele) has entered the lab of her husband Dr. Stephen Arrowsmith (Paul Muller) with a drink. He chastises her for entering without permission, commenting on her drinking. She acknowledges that he is leaving for a scientific conference where he will be with other fanatical good-for-nothings like yourself she taunts. He tells her not to speak to him like that. She reminds him that she is his wife and would like to spend the night with him. They kiss. Muriel notices that this has been observed by Solange (Helga Liné), who is waiting to see him off on his long journey. They say their goodbyes and he tells her he will only be a couple of days gone. The carriage is brought up by David (Rik Battaglia) who asks about the new plants. He is told to water them in the greenhouse. Dr. Arrowsmith leaves.Muriel goes to the piano and plays music. Hearing this, David drops what he is doing and heads into the house to meet her. Muriel disrobes, puts on her nightgown and perfume and begins passionate kissing with David, which progresses to the bed. She stops, suggesting they are too near Solanges room and they should go to the greenhouse. Once there, they lie down and begin passionate kissing.Outside we see Dr. Arrowsmith waiting and watching for a signal from Solange. From an upstairs window we see a light flashing back and forth. Holding his cane, he enters the greenhouse and confronts the lovers. He strikes David in the face with his cane, then his wife. Next we see both of them strung up on a wall with Stephen whipping them. He uses a heated poker on David. Next we see Stephen pouring a glass of water from a pitcher. Both look thirsty and Muriel begs for a sip. He brings it close, then pours it out. She curses him with her hatred, but then confesses that she recently remade her will, leaving all her wealth to her step-sister Jenny.Stephen is pouring through a book, presumably a law book, as he plans what he will do. Solange tells him he will have to keep her alive, but that Solange wants her share of the money that he has promised her. He reassures her that he will win and Solange will get what is coming to her. Then he says Jenny will inherit the money, but everyone knows Jenny is mad. She will be confined to a mental hospital and he will discover the cure.Next we see Muriel and David in the bedroom with Muriel chained to the bed and David chained to a chair. Stephen drips acid onto Muriel from a contraption and she cries out. David cries out as well, seeing her suffer. Stephen releases him from the chair and he rises, to be pushed onto the bed with her. Still shackled on his feet with wires connected, Stephen turns on a switch which electrocutes them both in bed. They cry out.Stephen is seen removing her heart from her corpse, which he places in a water tank along with the heart of David. Next we see her ashes placed in an urn with a strange plant.Stephen arrives at the castle with Jenny, who he has just married, having gotten her from the asylum. Solange is annoyed that he married her against their plan. He consoles Solange (who appears years younger) that once Jenny is insane enough to commit that he will be named over her estate and then Solange will get her money. In the meantime, he will see to it that Jenny goes mad.He prepares a hallucinogen to be added to Jennys drink which Solange adds. That night Jenny hears two hearts beating and gets up. She opens a door to find wind and a laughing woman\u0027s voice. Seeing the plant, which has almost bloomed, she notices drops of blood beside it. She gets back in bed with Stephen, who pretends to be asleep. Later she tells him about her dream and the blood. He tells her it is only a nightmare.Jenny and Stephen are seen at a fountain with white doves. Jenny asks questions about Muriel and Stephen fills her in. She apologizes to Stephen for her outburst last night. He tells her if could be nothing other than delirium, which he hopes will not happen again. Solange comes to tell him that the lab is ready. He goes with her, leaving Jenny at the fountain.In the lab, he finds that one vial is still present in the cabinet: the vial of hallucinogen that Jenny was supposed to have received last night. Solange apologizes and says it couldn\u0027t be. He insists otherwise, but tells her that regardless, Jenny seems to not need the drug to go over the edge. He kisses Solange.Jenny finds the sheet music on the piano and asks if Muriel wrote it. She is told that Muriel occasionally did write music. Jenny attempts to play the theme. As the music plays, she seems to become more like Muriel and asks for a drink. The servant brings it, and she remarks that she likes it. Stephen throws down a medical journal that he doesn\u0027t care for and complains about the doctor who wrote it. After the music has stopped, he notices that Jenny is gone. He and Solange go to her room, but she is not there. Then a scream is heard. Solange says that it comes from below. They head toward the passage leading down to the crypt. Another scream is heard before they reach it. At the bottom of the stairs, they push open a door to find Jenny white as a ghost, collapsing. Stephen carries her up to her bed. They discuss what happened and she cannot remember parts of it, only that her hands were bloody and she tried to remove the covering to the crypt. He tells her it was all in her imagination. She insists that the door to the crypt was locked, but he says no, it was easily opened when he pushed on it. He tells her that her condition frequently causes things to seem impossible. She begs him not send her back to the asylum and he agrees, but tells her he wants her to get better. Dr. Joyce (Marino Masé) will come and take care of her, since he did for so many years at the hospital.When Dr. Joyce arrives, he is greeted by Stephen and Jenny, who tries to sweep him away to the woods. Stephen intervenes, suggesting that the doctor has just arrived. Dr. Joyce says it is all right, but Jenny agrees that her husband is right, leaving and going inside.Dr. Joyce talks to Jenny about remembering all that has happened to her. He says Stephen has told him everything that has happened recently. She remembers something about David but gets confused. He asks what happened. She tells him that someone else takes over her mind and that then she gets confused. She remembers the crypt and the greenhouse, so they go there in an effort to remember. She says someone was kissing her, but she cant remember who. Someone else came in and struck him. She tells Dr. Joyce that she lost an earring which should be in the leaves below. When he finds it, she seems to recognize it but then when questioned further becomes confused. He suggests maybe she lost it another time. Then she admits that it is not her earring and she has never seen it before.In Dr. Arrowsmiths study, Solange breaks a bottle and he chides her, telling her he was able to restore her youth but not her mind. She reminds him that it is not her mind that he needs. Dr. Joyce comes in to discuss Jennys condition, showing him the earring that she found in the greenhouse. Stephen tells Solange to go find the other earring in Jennys room. Going to a secret location, Solange gets the other earring and goes to Jennys room (which Stephen says has changed per Dr. Joyce). She slips it into the jewel box and tells Jenny the Doctor wants to see it. When Jenny shows her jewelry to Dr. Joyce, she finds the other earring and becomes confused. Stephen brings over the other one, explaining that they are Muriels earrings and that Jenny has never worn them. Confused, she leaves the room.At dinner, Dr. Joyce is discussing wizards and witches of Africa who made contact with the dead, when suddenly Jenny rises, announcing she is tired and will turn in. Stephen tells her he will follow immediately. Jenny leaves and the doctors discuss her condition. All at once Solange cries out, having apparently cut herself. Stephen attends to her, telling Dr. Joyce he will have to take her to the lab to prevent a hemorrhage. He explains that she has a rare blood disorder but that it is nothing. As they leave the room, Dr. Joyce notices her place at the table, looking closely at it. The butler comes in and asks if he wants anything, to which he replies no. Announcing that he will go to his room, he leaves. The butler also looks at the place he was looking.Upstairs, Dr. Joyce finds his room locked and knocks, asking who is there. Behind him there is a noise and he looks around to find a passageway opening in a panel in the wall. He goes through.In the lab, Stephen tells Solange that they will need new blood. He draws some from a container and gives her an injection. He says this worked for now but soon they will need some new solution.Jenny awakens to the sound of the hearts beating. She hears Muriels voice telling her that her blood is being used down in the laboratory and to hurry. Jenny gets up and begins to go.Dr. Joyce finds himself in the crypt looking at graves. He finds Muriels crypt and the lid slides over, revealing it to be empty.Jenny enters the lab and picking up a scalpel, he goes to attack Stephen, who is attending to Solange. Solange cries out as she sees her coming. Striking his face with the scalpel, Jenny renders a cut on Stephen just as Dr. Joyce enters. He takes Jenny back to her room. Solange tells Stephen that it was not the face of Jenny but Muriel.In her room, Jenny draws Dr. Joyce to sit in bed with her. He speaks to her and she looks strangely at him, asking who he is. She tells him she is not Jenny, but Muriel and kisses him. Again he calls Jenny and she kisses him again. Suddenly the doors fly open and a breeze blows through. Seeing no one, Dr. Joyce returns to Jenny, who asks if he saw what she saw. He tells her that he will find out what it was. In the greenhouse, Jenny asks the doctor what Muriel wants with her. He tells her that she must leave these surroundings in order to get better.Solange tells Stephen that the doctor is now a threat and cannot be allowed to leave the castle. He agrees with her. At that moment Dr. Joyce enters and asks to speak to him. Solange leaves. He tells Stephen that he will take Jenny back to the clinic in the morning so she can get better. Stephen agrees and Dr. Joyce retires to his room, beginning to write. Next he calls the butler to prepare his bath. Meanwhile Stephen drills a hole in the wall in the bathroom and connects wires to electrocute Dr. Joyce when he steps into the tub. Before Joyce can do that, the butler returns with towels and fixes them on a rack by the tub. As he brushes by the tub, he accidently knocks the soap bar into the water. Hearing activity, Stephen prepares to throw the switch and does. When he reaches for the soap he cries out as he is electrocuted. Dr. Joyce removes him and next they are seen discussing his death. Joyce pronounces a heart attack and Stephen tells Solange to take Jenny away.Stephen asks Joyce to prepare a death certificate and help move his body back to his room. When that is done, Joyce wants to light a candle for the dead while Stephen leaves. After they both leave the room, the butlers hand falls to the side, revealing a burn on his wrist from the electric shock.Solange meets Stephen in the hall, confessing she is frightened and uncertain of what to do now. He reassures her everything will go as planned. He goes to speak to Jenny, telling her she has been through a shock. She says she is anxious to leave in the morning with Dr. Joyce. At this point he turns on her, accusing Dr. Joyce of manipulating her because she is weak, beautiful and rich. She swears he has done nothing wrong and that they have been friends for many years. He tells her he saw them holding hands in the greenhouse and that he doesn\u0027t want to lose her. He persuades her to come with him to Spain or Italy and she agrees.Next we see Dr. Joyce reluctantly telling Jenny that it will be good for her to go elsewhere. She acts as if he might be talking down to her. He tells her he will be leaving in the morning, but that he is very fond of her and if she ever needs anything for her to call upon him. She cries.That night she is dreaming as Muriel again and Dr. Joyce comes in and observes her as she writhes. He asks if it is Muriel and asks where her body is and who killed her. When Stephen comes into the room, he hides behind draperies. Jenny screams when she sees Stephen.Solange begs Stephen for the blood of Jenny to replenish her, saying that Muriels blood is heavy within her, like mercury. He promises that Jennys blood will be available soon.Next morning Dr. Joyce is saying goodbye when Jenny approaches and asks why he is leaving. She asks him if he likes the Hampton Crest which is at the base of a statue of two lovers. She seems more like Muriel. He bids them goodbye and leaves. Solange seems in pain waiting for the new blood.Jenny is seen in her room, packing. Thunder is heard outside. Jenny approaches Stephen and calls him. He comes toward her with a murderous look and slaps her down. Grabbing her, he tells Solange to come to the lab. Meanwhile in the rain we see Dr. Joyce who has returned and enters the castle. Inside, he looks at the Hampton Crest, finally turning it clockwise, which opens a cabinet door. Inside is the container with the two hearts of Muriel and David. He carries it to the desk and removes the dagger. The cries of Muriel and David are heard by Dr. Joyce and seen looking down from a high position.In the lab Stephen tells Jenny that her sister is calling her and that we will no longer have to deal with hearing her cries anymore. Solange cries out that she cant stand it. Stephen brings cotton dipped in ether and puts Jenny to sleep. Solange is told to lie on the other berth. After they are connected with tubes, Stephen tells Solange it will take about two hours and for her to remain still while he prepares for the trip the three of them will make.Stephen comes out and sees Muriel and David with their wounds, facing Dr. Joyce. Stephen hits Joyce from behind with a candlestick, knocking him out. Muriel takes Stephen aside, telling him she will help him see the ecstasy of pain and death that she has. As he pulls her hair aside, he sees her hideously deformed face. She laughs and secures him in the chair, throwing a candle and setting him on fire. Meanwhile David enters the lab and Solange, seeing him, screams. He cuts the blood line, laughing, and it drips on the floor. Next we see Stephens chair with his body completely burnt up. Muriel stops laughing. Solange is shown back in her old body again as David laughs, destroying the lab equipment. Next we see Solange as only a skeleton.Dr. Joyce recovers and stands up. David approaches Jenny on the table and shakes her. She awakens and screams. At this point Dr. Joyce comes in and pulls David away into the lab which is filling with smoke. He picks Jenny up and carries her out. Upstairs they lock the doors to keep David out and turn to run. Jenny is horrified to see Muriel coming toward them. David breaks the doors open and comes in. At this point Dr. Joyce takes the two hearts and throws them into the fire. As they burn, Muriel and David disappear. Dr. Joyce and Jenny run outside into the rain. As they pause and look back, he tells her she is safe now and will have no more problems from Muriel. The two hearts are shown again burning in the fireplace.","Weighted Degree":"1.0","numvotes":"2404","productioncompany":"Cinematografica EmmeCi","countriesoforigin":"Italy","averagerating":"5.7","originaltitle":"Amanti d\u0027oltretomba","size":"1","genres":"Horror Only","storyline":"A sadistic count tortures and murders his unfaithful wife and her lover, then removes their hearts from their bodies.

A small village nestled between steep mountain peaks. The camera pans slowly to the top of Trollenberg Mountain\u0027s rugged face. A single small cloud clings to the side .Two climbers (Jeremy Longhurst and Anthony Parker) huddle together on a ledge overlooking the valley below as a third climber,  (Jack Taylor), calls to them from above. complains to them of a sudden bitter cold and a fog that has abruptly reduced visibility. He calls out to them that someone is coming in his direction, but that he can\u0027t make them out in the fog. He screams and falls past his fellows on the ledge below. Acting quickly they secure his rope and begin to pull him back up. As his motionless blood-stained body comes in view one of them Anthony Parker falls mute, staring in horror at what he sees. He falters, and as the other climber, Jeremy Longhurst, continues to pull against the weight the rope wears thin against the jagged rock face. The body falls unseen down the face of the cliff. Jeremy Longhurst, shouts at Anthony Parker, \"you idiot, we nearly had him.\" Anthony Parker stares frozen and pale, \"Didn\u0027t you see? His head... it was torn off!\"In the valley below a train speeds by through tall fir trees. As it approaches a tunnel mouth the film title races out of the tunnel toward the viewer, \"The Trollenberg Terror (1958),\" in jagged text, as the train plunges into the blackness of the tunnel. Stanley Black\u0027s music crescendos in suspense as the opening credits flash across the screen. The train emerges into daylight at the far end of the tunnel as the credits end.Two attractive young women,  and  (Jennifer Jayne and Janet Munro) on their way to Geneva, nap together in a non-descript cabin car aboard the train as a gentleman,  (Forrest Tucker), seated opposite them reads his newspaper. Anne stirs and Sarah wakes her from her nap, apparently disturbed by a dream she doesn\u0027t quite recall. Sarah directs Anne\u0027s attention to the mountain view outside the train cabin window. As she looks out toward Mount Trollenberg her cheerful smile melts into a seeming trance. She turns away from the window inexplicably shaken by something she has apparently seen and collapses into the arms of Alan Brooks, leading to an awkward introduction.The train\u0027s conductor wanders by, as they converse, announcing the next stop as Trollenberg. Anne announces that they must get off there to her sister\u0027s amazement. More shocking still Anne seems to know the town in great detail, though she has never been there, even naming the Hotel Europa as their destination, seemingly without having any way of knowing the hotel even exists. Sarah protests, but Anne insists, yet still completely unable to explain her knowledge of the town or the reason she feels compelled to stop there. Mr. Brooks retreats into an uncomfortable silence at the oddly tense exchange, as the train rolls into the station.A man enters the Trollenberg train station strolling briskly past scenic tourist wall posters of a lush valley overlooked by snow capped mountains. In the station lobby,  (Frederick Schiller), the proprietor of the Hotel Europa and the Mayor of Trollenberg, introduces himself, as Alan Brooks introduces him to the Pilgrim Sisters, Anne and Sarah. Sarah apologizes for and then thanks Herr Klein for him accommodating them without a reservation at the Europa and Herr Klein becomes uncomfortable with a nervous attempt to explain why his hotel isn\u0027t fully booked during his peak season, On the drive from the train station to the hotel Anne becomes distracted, and begins describing the recent death of the climber on Mt. Trollenberg. She seems to be babbling details she couldn\u0027t possibly know, yet Herr Klein is noticeably shaken by statements she pulls out of thin air. Herr Klein stumbles through a clumsy apology for both the death of the young climber and then an account by Anne of the mountain folk leaving the area in the belief that it is in some way cursed. It is revealed that this recent tragedy is not the first death on the mountain, and that it has become a common occurrence for those who venture there to disappear without a trace.The car approaches the hotel along a picturesque tree lined road. A balcony overlooks an immaculate garden at the front of a quaint gabled chalet with a small mazot outbuilding in the background. The scene is framed by the alps, half shrouded in mist. Amidst the beauty of the scene Alan Brooks and the Pilgrim Sisters exit the car. Anne seems unnerved by Mt. Trollenberg, looming above them in the landscape.Journalist,  (Laurence Payne), sips on his beer and smokes at the small bar as the group enters the hotel lobby.  (Colin Douglas) tends the bar and excuses himself to unload the car as Truscott introduces himself to the group. He seems to recognize the sisters from somewhere, though he is unable for the moment to place them. The sisters retire to their room, and Sarah opens the window on a view of Mt. Trollenberg. Anne looks out upon the scene and once again becomes transfixed, describing details of a hiking shack, and cable car of which she has no prior knowledge, as though looking out on the scene she is able to see features to distant to be visible, in more detail than mere description or memory, but as though she were there. She becomes frustrated with the reasons the mountain seems so familiar to her, electing at Sarah\u0027s suggestion to believe that she must have read about it in a travel brochure, rather than as Anne suspects, that she remembers it from scenes in a dream. Anne gazes out again at the mountain, this time silent but still haunted by her attraction to it and something terrifying that she is unable to recall.Truscott pays Mr. Brooks a visit in his room, exchanging pleasantries and small talk as Brooks unpacks his bags. Truscott\u0027s banal seeming banter gives way to subtle interrogation as Brooks\u0027 answers become more curious to him. As Brooks finishes unpacking his revolver is plainly visible, and Truscott\u0027s curiosity is whetted. Truscott suddenly recalls where he has seen Sarah and Anne before and reveals to Brooks\u0027 amusement that they are performers with a mind-reading act. Truscott, excuses himself to his own room down the hall, but fails to close the door to his room. As Brooks leaves his own room he overhears Truscott on the telephone, requesting that Brooks be checked out. Brooks shrugs it off, but puzzles for a moment. As he enters the lobby his contemplation is broken as he\u0027s greeted by geologist  (Stuart Saunders) and his mountain guide,  (Andrew Faulds) who are finalizing their plans to climb \"The Trollenberg.\"  is intent on finding the reason behind the rash of deaths on the mountain and suspects that some peculiar mineral formation must be the problem, while  remains skeptical. Dewhurst buys a round of drinks for everyone as they wander down from their rooms, all except Anne, who has remained behind to have a quiet nap, Sarah seeming to be of the impression that her sister\u0027s strange behavior is the result of stress and over-work.Truscott admonishes Brett to \"mind his roping,\" and they begin an exchange concerning the terrible and peculiar death of the young climber the previous week. Truscott suggests that the rope had become tangled around the climbers neck, and had decapitated him. Hans reluctantly disagrees, and tells the room that the matter is more mysterious still, that the rope had been tied around the young climber\u0027s waist, and that the villagers did not share the opinion that it had decapitated him, but something else, something evil.As the gathering breaks up, Brooks hitches a ride with Brett and Dewhurst on the cable car on his way to \"The Observatory.\" On the long cable-car ride up the mountain, Dewhurst explains his theory that chemical changes in the mountain rocks could be loosening or cracking them, making climbing the mountain a dangerous enterprise as Brett looks on unconvinced.The cosmic ray observatory is an imposing structure, more like a bunker than an academic facility. Massive, windowless concrete walls taper upward like the battlements of a fortress. The handrails of a long twisting stair can be seen winding up the ragged slope.In the laboratory  (Warren Mitchell) pours over the observatory\u0027s cosmic ray detector and flusters impatiently when interrupted by his assistant,  (Derek Sydney) informing him of a visitor. He greets Brooks at the observatory\u0027s entrance, a heavily reinforced steel door befitting the robust construction of the observatory itself. Even the observatory\u0027s single window is shielded by a huge steel shutter which the professor demonstrates. TV monitors provide the exterior view from a console inside, making the observatory proof against the worst avalanche imaginable.A cryptic conversation ensues between Brooks and the professor concerning the death of the student mountain climber, and many many other similar incidents in which, as the professor explains, no bodies had ever been found. Mysterious disappearances all in the same area of The Trollenberg. Brooks discounts them as the unfortunate but inevitable result of inexperienced climbers underestimating the dangers of the treacherous peak. The professor argues that Mt. Trollenberg has a single small cloud on its south face, which should not be there. Brooks is unimpressed but one senses that there is a hidden significance to the presence of the small cloud, \"where there are mountains there are always clouds,\" Brooks says, almost as though he is trying to convince himself. At least he seems skeptical until the professor reveals that this cloud never moves, and is radioactive. He demonstrates to Brooks using the observatory\u0027s cosmic ray detector, scanning the mountain, and each scan registering high radiation levels as the scanner passes the cloud. Their past association is revealed as the conversation turns to an incident three years prior in the Andes, where a similar pattern emerged. They shroud the nature of the incident as though reluctant to say in plain terms that they suspected a sinister cause. The professor urges Brooks to alert the authorities, but he\u0027s reluctant. The incident in the Andes damaged his credibility and was still an embarrassment to him. If no evidence were found to support him this time, he would look like a fool, and his career would likely end abruptly. Concerned but uncertain of a course of action he hesitates. \"This can\u0027t be the same. There are too many things missing,\" Brooks exclaims, \"mental compulsion...\" He stops in mid-sentence suddenly recalling Anne Pilgrim\u0027s strange attraction to Trollenberg and her odd behavior.Wilde interrupts, shouting across the laboratory room, \"there\u0027s climbers on The Trollenberg!\" His statement alarms Crevett and Brooks and they turn there attention to the climbers immediately. Professor Crevett activates the TV monitors and zooms in on the climbers as they ascend the mountain toward a small cabin. Brooks recognizes the geologist, Dewhurst and his guide, Brett.The professor presses Brooks to act on the situation, but Brooks is still reluctant. \"...I\u0027m not going to stick my neck out again like I did in the Andes,\" he murmurs. \"...they practically accused me of dreaming the whole thing up. If I was to take a hand here, I\u0027d have to have a list of documented facts, and they\u0027d have to be pretty conclusive.\" Brooks appears troubled. He seems to know that Crevett is right, yet his experience in the Andes has made him leery of the repercussions of making their theory public.Dewhurst and Brett arrive at the cabin without incident to the great relief of Brooks. The small cabin is little more than an eight foot by ten foot wooden shack of rough hewn planks set against a landscape of snowy mountain ridges. Brett enters followed by Dewhurst and after stowing his pack on the upper bunk at the back wall, begins a casual examination of the cabin\u0027s facilities, a few small pots and pans, an oil burning portable stove. Brett uses the cabin\u0027s primitive telephone to ring the Hotel Europa to inform Herr Klein of their safe arrival. It seems to reinforce the notion that the accidents have simply been a coincidence caused by a large number of careless climbers. Brooks and Crevett share his relief, but they obviously hold some doubt in reserve.Evening comes as Brett and Dewhurst settle in. Brett busies himself with notes of some kind as Dewhurst dozes in the lower bunk. Brett opens the cabin door and notes that visibility has declined. A small cloud has moved down the mountain and brought with it both thick fog and an intense chill.Meanwhile, in the lobby of the Hotel Europa, the Pilgrim Sisters are entertaining the guests with there mind-reading act. Anne correctly identifies a bank note reading off the serial number without ever seeing the note, to the delight of the onlookers. A second object is introduced. Anne correctly identifies it as a snow globe, describing the scene inside the small glass dome. As she begins to detail the small cabin in the scene, her trance becomes dark and disturbing. She is no longer describing the cabin in the snow globe but the cabin on the slopes of The Trollenberg where Brett and Dewhurst have camped for the night. She describes the two men in the cabin, as Brett himself seems to fall under some sort of trance. He leaves the cabin as if sleep walking, seemingly oblivious to having left the door open he walks off into the distance. Anne describes him coming up the slope and Dewhurst sleeping in the bunk. The guests become alarmed and her sister, Sarah becomes fearful of her sister\u0027s unexplained deviation from their act. Anne collapses as Brooks rushes to the phone. He calls the cabin and wakes Dewhurst. As Dewhurst assures Brooks that everything is quite alright and that Brett must have simply stepped out for a bit of air.Anne awakens in her bed with her sister, Truscott and Prof. Crevett watching over her. Crevett takes Sarah aside and insists that she must take Anne away from the area in the morning. Anne is sedated and left to sleep as the others return to the hotel lobby. Crevett comments to Brooks that in her trance, Anne had described Brett from the perspective not of the cabin, but from outside the cabin, as though observing him from further up the mountain slope.Crevett briefly interrogates Sarah and confirms that Anne is genuinely telepathic. He again insists that Sarah remove Anne from the area first thing in the morning, but is less than candid when she presses him for an explanation. The phone rings in the hotel lobby, and Crevett is called to speak to his assistant, Wilde. He alerts the professor that the strange radioactive cloud has begun to move slowly down the face of The Trollenberg toward the cabin and that its radioactivity has begun to increase. Crevett informs Brooks that the cloud has moved into the vicinity of the cabin and Brooks rushes to the phone. Dewhurst answers and confirms that Brett has not yet returned but that he can\u0027t see far outside do to the heavy fog. It has also become bitterly cold. As they converse he hears something outside the cabin. He checks the door, locking with door with a bar from the inside. However, it looks like the unseen danger has entered the cabin from a back door as Dewhurst begins to scream and Brooks cannot do anything but for listening to the screams in horror. The phone line goes dead leaving all at the Hotel Europa in panic and suspense.Once again the phone rings in the hotel lobby, as Wilde informs the professor that the cloud has begun to move away from the cabin again.Mayor Klein, Brooks, Truscott and several villagers gather just before dawn in the hotel lobby and prepare packs and ropes for a rescue expedition. Herr Klein calls for a search plane, but doesn\u0027t expect that it will arrive until later that morning.Anne stirs restlessly shortly after dawn, tossing in her sleep and muttering. She describes men coming up the mountain to the hut. Crevett and Sarah attempt to calm her. She returns to sleep and Sarah presses the professor once again for an explanation for her sister\u0027s behavior. This time hew does explain in closely guarded words that Anne is sensitive to the mental images that Sarah transmits to her during their act, but that like a radio receiver, her mind is now overwhelmed by the mental images projected by a much stronger mind.On the slopes of The Trollenberg, the rescue party arrives at the cabin. The door bolted from the inside. Herr Klein knocks and calls to the men he is certain must be inside. Brooks breaks the door in and finds the interior of the cabin frozen. Ice crystals glitter on the blankets on the bunks. They find Dewhurst under the bottom bunk, his head mysteriously missing.Sarah serves her sister breakfast in bed as she makes her intentions known that they depart Trollenberg immediately. Anne argues at first but appears to relent when Sarah insists. Sarah excuses herself to the lobby to make the arrangements and Anne once again falls into a trance in her absence. She gazes out the window at The Trollenberg, the small odd cloud clinging close to its face in the distance. She dresses in haste, as though possessed by a purpose.The search party prepares a litter and carries Dewhurst\u0027s body, Truscott discovers the broken phone lines, and Brooks examines them closely. They crumble at his touch crystallized by intense cold.Anne sneaks out of the hotel, leaving Sarah behind. She holds her head with her hands as if fighting off enormous pressure. She gazes up again to the cloud.as the search plane passes overhead. She heads off in the direction of the mountain.Two members of the search party  (Richard Golding) and  (George Herbert), greet the approaching search plane with a portable radio. They exchange map coordinates with the  (Garard Green) and begin their search for Brett.Sarah returns to the hotel room to find Anne missing along with her coat. As she searches for her out the window the cable car passes in the distance. Sarah rushes from the room to catch her as Anne stands in the cable car, her gaze locked ahead at The Trollenberg. Sarah rushes to the phone to alert the professor at the observatory that her sister is on her way up in the cable car.The search plane circles high above the slopes and the pilot radios the search party that he has sighted Brett, waving below. He reports Brett\u0027s position and heads off into the distance.Wilde meets Anne at the cable car platform and escorts her there under weak protest. (Richard Golding) and  (George Herbert) head to Brett\u0027s location and find his pack, but Brett himself doesn\u0027t seem to be around. As they examine the contents of the pack they find Dewhurst\u0027s severed head. Brett appears suddenly with a look of crazed homicidal lust in his eyes, wielding a climbing pick he attacks them, killing each of them in turn.The professor and Wilde busy themselves with measurements at the observatory as Anne sits quietly. She rises unnoticed and slips past them, sneaking to the massive steel entrance door. On opening the door however she is met by Brooks, Hans, Truscott and the returning members of the search party. She attempts to leave, but Brooks prevents her.Later back at the Hotel Europa, after returning Anne to her bed, Brooks and Professor Crevett discuss the strange radioactive cloud. Truscott interupts, and during the conversation that ensues reveals himself to be a journalist, investigating the mysterious deaths and disappearances. He also knows something of the incident in the Andes.   He confronts them both about stories that they had attributed the strange events in the Andes to alien creatures. Brooks himself then reveals that his role in his position at the UN is part of a special taskforce to investigate possible alien invasions.Brett to everyone\u0027s amazement, wanders in as though nothing has happened. No longer crazed, but seems exhausted and complains that the temperature is too hot. Weak and uncoordinated his motor skills terribly damaged somehow, he attempts to pour himself a drink and spills brandy all over the bar. Anne wanders down from her room, and at the sight of her Brett resumes his crazed state, drawing a knife from his belt and lunges for her. Brooks punches him soundly and sends him spinning backward. His head strikes a bronze statue of a wolf, howling which gashes his head deeply. He collapses to the floor, but to the shock of Truscott and Sarah, the wound doesn\u0027t bleed. Brett is carried into the wine cellar where Professor Crevett stitches his forehead. They leave, locking him in the wine cellar while they discuss informing the UN of the situation and Brett\u0027s zombie like condition.Brett awakens and hides against the wine cellar door as Mayor Klein approaches. Herr Klein peers in through the small window in the door and Brett grabs him by the neck, killing him and retrieving the mayor\u0027s keys from his pocket. Hearing the commotion, Sarah stirs from her sleep and goes to investigate. Brett finds a large clever in the kitchen and shuffles toward the stairway to the bedrooms on the upper floor just as Sarah reaches the top of the stair and sees him, alerting Alan Brooks. Brett enters the sister\u0027s room as Sarah pounds on Brook\u0027s door in panic.   Brooks appears behind Brett in the doorway as Anne awakens, Brett standing over her bed with the clever raised to strike. Anne screams as a single shot rings out and Brett falls to the floor, Brooks standing in the doorway, revolver in hand.Crevett and Brooks begin an examination of Brett\u0027s body noting a peculiar cast to his skin. Crevett instructs Hans to hold his oil lamp lower to allow a better view and as he does so the flesh of Brett\u0027s arm seems to vaporize, leaving only skeletal remains. Truscott bursts into the room and announces that the observatory has phoned to tell them that the radioactive cloud has begun to move down the mountain again, this time directly toward the village.Brooks decides that they should all head for the observatory due to the heavily fortified structure, but Hans panics and speeds off toward the valley straight into the path of the oncoming cloud. Brooks gathers the party and a number of villagers together and they head off to the cable car. As they leave, a  (Caroline Glaser) drops her toy ball in the hotel lobby.From the platform they watch the cloud pour down from The Trollenberg into the village below. It stops in front of the hotel. The toy ball lies on the floor in the middle of the lobby as wisps of frosty mist can be seen under the lobby door.The cable car arrives at the platform and as they party rushes to the car, a  (Anne Sharp) realizes her daughter is nowhere to be found. Brooks instructs Truscott to leave him behind if he doesn\u0027t return before the cloud heads toward them, and he heads back down toward the village and the hotel in search of the child.In the hotel lobby, the doors begin to shake and finally break inward revealing the horror outside. A massive bulbous creature with long sinuous tentacles and a single enormous eye presses against the frame of the door, peering and reaching about inside the lobby with its tentacles. The young girl enters the lobby from the side entrance unaware of the danger lurking a few meters away and retrieves her toy ball. The alien seizes her with a tentacle as Alan Brooks bursts in through the window pick-axe in hand. He severs the tentacle holding her and rushes her away as the alien wails in pain. They return to the cable car and begin the ascent to the observatory as mist begins to filter onto the cable car platform below. Frost begins to form on the cable car pulley and the cable car lurches violently as the mechanism begins to freeze. The cable car arrives at the observatory platform and Brooks rushes the passengers out, fearing the cable could snap at any moment.The thick steel door of the observatory opens and Wilde ushers the party inside, rushing Brooks and Truscott to the main laboratory while the villagers huddle in the entry hall. In the laboratory Crevett informs them that the cloud has broken up into separate clouds, four, then five, all moving toward the observatory.On the video monitor Hans appears at the door. Wilde goes to let him in and asks him what happened. Hans explains that he ran into the cloud on the road and turned around. He seems mildly confused and disoriented and complains that the room is too hot, grasping at the collar of his sweater. They leave Hans in the entry hall and return to the lab. Hans peers around the corner and meets Anne\u0027s gaze. A crazed look comes over him as Anne retreats quietly to the professor\u0027s office at the rear of the lab. (Theodore Wilhelm) the professor\u0027s other assistant sits at a large console and alerts the professor of a sudden drop in temperature on the platform outside. Brooks begins to puzzle out the need for cold by the creatures as well as those who have come under their control. He mentions that Brett complained of the heat in the hotel before attempting to kill Anne, and Wilde interupts that Hans also complained on the heat upon his unexpected return. The party rushes to locate Hans and find him in the office, his large hands wrapped tightly around Anne\u0027s neck. Truscott leaps onto Han\u0027s back and pries him off of her as Brooks enters the office. The two struggle with Hans as Anne lies motionless on the professor\u0027s desk. Finally Brooks stabs Hans with a letter opener and he collapses.In the lab Brooks orders an airstrike of firebombs to be dropped on the observatory, in the hope that the thick concrete structure will resist the intense heat. The party begins constructing improvised malatov cocktails as the mist begins to gather outside. The hideous aliens can be seen outside creeping slowly up the rocky slope toward the observatory.The professor calls Brooks to the video console as the aliens make their appearance. Brooks grabs one of the molotov cocktails and steps outside. Launching it at one of the creatures as it sheiks in a high pitched unearthly tone. Truscott follows suit and is grabbed from above by an alien tentacle. As he dangles above the ground Brooks launches another of the homemade incendiaries up toward the roof of the observatory. Truscott falls to the ground and the creature retreats with a piercing wail. Brooks and Truscott rush inside and seal the door.As the creatures freeze the cameras, rendering them blind, the UN airstike arrives and contacts the observatory for instructions.Sarah tends her still unconscious sister in the office as one of the creatures lurks outside the heavy wall. Behind them the wall begins to crack from the intense cold and a door sized chunk of concrete falls inward revealing the creature outside, tentacles waving trough the opening, grasping for Sarah and Anne. Brooks rushes in at the commotion, heedless of the danger in an attempt to rescue them from the clutches of the alien and is caught by a tentacle. Truscott follows ushering Sarah and Anne to the relative safety of the main lab as Brooks struggles.   Truscott rushes to the lab and returns with another maltov cocktail which he hurls through the opening and Brooks frees himself from its grasp. They hasten to the lab and close the door.Hugo (uncredited role), another of the professors assistants, monitors the communications station and alerts Brooks to the approach of the fighter plane. He instructs the pilot to bomb the cloud covering the observatory.Overhead, \"Jolly Rodger\" squares his fighter plane up for his first pass and begins dropping his fire bombs.   They frame the building in flames as they strike the roof and surround the building. The aliens shriek and lash about with their tentacles. He returns for a second pass and the creatures are engulfed in flame, blackening and crisping. The wailing subsides as the creatures perish in the flames.The building\u0027s once pristine exterior is piled with the blackened remains of the immense alien bodies, smoking in ruin, but still distinct enough in form to provide Alan Brooks and Professor Crevett with the validation of their theory. Disaster averted the townfolk have been saved from gruesome death and the Earth from alien invasion.The steel window shutter slides up, permitting sunlight into the lab once again, the smoking husk of an alien poised on the roof above it. From inside the lab the view of The Trollenberg is once again visible. Anne and Truscott scamper out the steel door together as if, suddenly relieved of the terror they have found a romantic interest in each other, as Brooks and Sarah remark in jest on whether Anne will be safe in his company. The sky is clear and the party rejoices. Crevett observes that for the first time in three years, The Trollenberg is free of clouds, and Brooks expresses his hope that it stays that way.The Trollenberg stands majestically in the background...The closing credits role.","Weighted Degree":"1.0","numvotes":"4161","productioncompany":"Tempean Films","countriesoforigin":"United Kingdom","averagerating":"5.1","originaltitle":"The Trollenberg Terror","size":"1","genres":"Horror,Sci-Fi","storyline":"A remote mountain resort in Switzerland is invaded by horrible alien creatures that like to decapitate humans.

Her daughter Clare (Raegan Revord) goes to ride her bicycle with her dog Max. Johanna goes into the house looking spaced. When Clare comes home, she goes into the attic to find Johanna hanging herself.Teenage Clare (now played by Joey King) wakes up from this nightmare. She gets ready to go to school. Clare rides her bike to school and sees her Uncle August (Victor Sutton), whom her father won\u0027t let her speak to for some reason. Clare is distracted and nearly gets struck by popular girl Darcie Chapman (Josephine Langford). Clare just scrapes her knee and rips her legging.When Clare gets to school, she sees her father Jonathan (Ryan Phillipe) dumpster-diving with his friend Carl (Kevin Hanchard). Embarrassed, she goes to tell him to go away. Clare then joins her friends June Acosta (Shannon Purser) and Meredith McNeil (Sydney Park) while we see that Clare has a crush on popular guy Paul Middlebrook (Mitchell Slaggart). Darcie also takes an opportunity to be a bitch and hit Clare with her drink.Back home, Clare returns to see her dad has found a large music box. Clare takes it inside and reads that the box will grant seven wishes. She scoffs it off.The next day, Clare is at school with June and Meredith when they are giggling as Darcie and her clique of mean girls walk by. Darcie questions Clare as to why she\u0027s laughing, and Clare says that she called Darcie \"ultimate smegma\", which is some kind of genital secretion in both males and females. Darcie smacks Clare, who smacks her back. Clare then gets knocked over, and she retaliates by tackling Darcie to the ground and engaging in a girl fight.When Clare goes home, she takes the music box and makes what she thinks is a hypothetical wish for Darcie to \"go rot\".The following morning, after an apparently crazy party in her home, Darcie wakes up to find part of her hands, feet, and face looking grotesquely rotted. The news spreads around the school that Darcie got necrotizing facilities from a spa, and that means Clare\u0027s wish has come true. However, the next morning, Clare goes to look for Max and finds his dead body under the deck in the house. She and Jonathan bury their dog.After spending a good part of her day pining for Paul, Clare decides to make her second wish be that Paul would fall madly in love with her. When she goes to school again, Paul approaches her and shows clear interest, even in front of his girlfriend Lola Sanchez (Daniela Barbosa).In Uncle August\u0027s home, the old man is preparing to take a bath. He fills his tub with water and steps in, only to clumsily slip and hit his head on the side of the tub. He regains consciousness, only to bang his head on the nozzle and die.Upon learning of August\u0027s death, Clare wonders to her father if August left his inheritance to anyone. Jonathan doubts he or Clare would have been mentioned. Considering that they aren\u0027t very financially stable at the moment, Clare goes to her room and tells the music box her third wish, which is that August had left her everything.Clare wakes up the next day to Jonathan telling her that August apparently left Clare his entire inheritance. Soon, the two move into a mansion and start driving flashy cars. Jonathan gives Clare his credit card so that she can treat June and Meredith to a shopping spree.Paul officially breaks up with Lola and immediately proceeds to ask Clare out. She takes some time to think about it.The Shannons\u0027 former neighbor Mrs. Deluca (Sherilyn Fenn) is in her home cooking dinner. She drops something down the garbage disposal and sticks her hand in there while precariously leaning close to the switch. Meanwhile, her pots on the stove appear to be burning. Mrs. Deluca pulls her hand out and turns off the stove. She then moves back toward the sink. Her ponytail goes down the disposal and she accidentally turns it on, causing the disposal to yank her hair and break her neck.Clare is still annoyed that her dad goes dumpster-diving for knick-knacks. She uses her fourth wish for Jonathan to be less embarrassing. Jonathan then becomes a smooth saxophone player that even Clare\u0027s friends find hot.Clare asks her friend Ryan Hui (Ki Hong Lee) for help in figuring out the phrase on the music box, as well as its history. They visit his cousin Gina (Alice Lee) in her loft. They find that the box has been passed down for decades, but they cannot translate the phrase. Gina sends the phrase to someone for an answer.That night, Gina is alone in her loft when she receives an email with the translation. She says it\u0027s messed up and it starts to freak her out. She tries to call Ryan outside but he doesn\u0027t answer the phone. The door behind her slams and causes her to drop her phone. She goes back inside as the power is out. In the darkness, she trips and falls face-first onto a the horn of a bull statue.At school, Clare is now Paul\u0027s girlfriend, but all of his friends don\u0027t care to hang out with her since Paul dumped Lola for her. Clare then wishes that she would become the most popular girl in school. She then gets invited to a party with Paul where they have a good time and go to his car to hook up, only for Clare to realize Paul is talking to other girls behind her back, as well as spying on her and taking pictures. She leaves Paul.Ryan finds Gina\u0027s phone on the ground and runs up to her loft to find her dead. He finds Clare at school and tells her that he learned the phrase on the box translates to \"When the music ends, the blood price is paid.\" He tells Clare that Gina is dead. Ryan also tells Clare that he\u0027s learned more about the box\u0027s history. Those who have used it all ended up dead. He refers to a man (Jerry O\u0027Connell) who used the box\u0027s wishes to make his life better, only for his wife and children to perish. He burned his house down with himself and the box inside, but the box survived. Clare and Ryan do what they can to destroy the box themselves (burning it, hitting it with sledgehammers, etc), but nothing works.Clare goes to Mrs. Deluca\u0027s home and enters to a horrible smell. She then finds Mrs. Deluca\u0027s dead body still lingering by the sink.Clare tells June and Meredith about the box and how she\u0027s been making wishes. Meredith chides her for not using wishes on good things instead of using them on herself. June encourages Clare to get rid of the box. Clare goes to do so, but then decides to keep the box just in case.While Clare is sleeping at night, she finds Paul has broken into her room. He asks her if it\u0027s over between them. Clare makes it obvious that it is, and he slits his wrist. He is later taken to the hospital.The girls hang out at a hotel. Clare gets a phone call from Jonathan saying he\u0027s going to a gig, and he soon gets a flat tire. The scene jumps between Jonathan changing his tire and Meredith going off by herself to play a phone app. Clare admits to June that she didn\u0027t get rid of the box. Meredith then sets foot in an elevator to rejoin her friends. Jonathan is nearly struck by two drag racers. He goes under the car to grab a missing piece, with the car jack nearly loosening itself. Finally, he knocks the spare tire loose, which gets hit by an oncoming car and nearly tears Jonathan\u0027s head off. The elevator that Meredith is on then malfunctions before dropping completely and crashing to the bottom, killing Meredith. June blames Clare for this.Clare struggles with the result of her wishes and the thought of undoing them. Eventually, the wishes are undone when Clare and Jonathan have their money taken because Uncle August never paid his taxes. They move back into their old home. Darcie returns to school with her skin healing and she\u0027s still a bitch to Clare. Clare finds out that June took the box from her room to try and get rid of it but Clare takes it back.Utterly frustrated and losing her mind, Clare tries to resist making another wish, but she makes her sixth wish be that her mother never committed suicide. Seconds later, she hears Johanna\u0027s voice. Clare embraces her mother for the first time in years. It also turns out that in this new time line, Clare has younger twin sisters. The happiness is short-lived Clare sees Jonathan outside under a tree as Carl is trying to chop off a branch with a chainsaw. Clare runs outside to warn her dad, only for Carl\u0027s ladder to wobble, causing him to accidentally swing the chainsaw down and decapitate Jonathan. Clare runs up to the attic and among her mom\u0027s paintings, she finds one of the same box, leading her to realize her mom once had the same box and it was responsible for her suicide. Clare screams at the box that she wants to use her last wish to go back to the day that her dad found the box.Clare wakes up on that fateful day. Max is on her bed. She calls Meredith to hear her voice, though she\u0027s annoyed that Clare woke her up. Clare asks Jonathan if she can join him and Carl as they go looking for things. Clare finds the box in a bin and wraps it in a sheet, taking it with her. Before going to school, she tells her dad she loves him.Clare finds Ryan and gives him the box, saying how she knows Gina and that she can figure out what the box says and that they should get rid of it. She also makes dinner plans with Ryan and kisses him in front of June and Meredith. Clare walks off happily... and then Darcie accidentally hits her with her car, sending Clare\u0027s body flying several feet and crashing onto a windshield. All the students look on in horror as Clare lays dead on the windshield of the other car.In the after credit scene, Ryan is seen finishing digging up a hole to bury the box. Then he looks around and takes out the box from the bag in which Clare handed it over to him saying never to open to see what\u0027s inside and to bury it so nobody could find it. He removes the dirt around the box and reads the Chinese letters and says, \"Seven wishes\" and looks around with a mischievous smile on his face.","Weighted Degree":"3.0","numvotes":"20262","productioncompany":"Broad Green Pictures","countriesoforigin":"United States, Canada","averagerating":"5.0","originaltitle":"Wish Upon","size":"1","genres":"Drama,Fantasy,Horror","storyline":"A teen girl discovers a magical box that will grant her seven wishes.

A solitary figure walks down the street holding an umbrella. We enter the Wax Museum with various tableaux of crimes of the past, and then enter the workshop where Prof. Henry Jarrod (Vincent Price) is working on a sculpture. His business partner, Matthew Burke (Roy Roberts) enters and walks partially upstairs when he is hailed by Jarrod. He tells Jarrod he\u0027s there to study the account books. They have a philosophical difference between their approaches to business. Jarrod proposes a buyout arrangement, and Burke either eager or desperate for the money agrees in principle. A potential investor is scheduled to see Jarrod that very evening.Bruce Allison (Phillip Tonge) and Sidney Wallace (Paul Cavanagh) arrive and are given a brief tour of the wax museum. Wallace is impressed, but Jarrod explains that he\u0027s never satisfied with certain aspects of the finished products. Wallace explains he\u0027s going to Egypt for three months, so no decision on investment can take place prior to his return. Allison and Wallace depart. Burke was eavesdropping from the upstairs room and heard everything. He is impatient for a financial settlement and proposes an insurance fire. The place is insured for $25,000--$12,500 each. Jarrod is horrified by the proposal, and opposes it categorically. Burke lights the Marie Antoinette wax figure\u0027s dress with a match. It starts a fire that Jarrod quickly extinguishes. Burke starts a few more fires, with Jarrod quickly working to save his wax figures. Burke and Jarrod fight, and at one point Jarrod is knocked out. Burke douses the workroom and display area with a flammable liquid and turns on the gas light spigots. He goes upstairs as the place begins to catch fire. He returns to the workroom and continues his fight with the now revived Jarrod. Jarrod works desperately with buckets of water to douse the fire, but it is a losing battle. He is knocked out again by Burke and left in the burning building. The gas ignites blowing out the front of the building. The police and fire departments respond.At a dance Burke is entertaining a young lady, Cathy Gray (Carolyn Jones). He tells Cathy he and Jarrod were friends and no trace of him was found after the fire. He confides to Cathy the insurance settled with a check this morning and he\u0027s already cashed it. Burke returns to his office, opens his safe and pulls out the money. Jarrod is there, horribly scarred from the fire wearing all black. He turns off the lights then attacks Burke with a rope. He takes the money, but before he can exit he hears the cleaning lady on the stairs. She continues down the stairs. Jarrod has something dramatic planned. He rigs a rope in the elevator, carries Burke to the elevator door, ties the loose end around Burke\u0027s neck and throws the body down the elevator shaft. The cleaning lady (Ruth Warren) screams when she discovers the dead body. It is meant to look like a suicide.At their boarding house Sue Allen (Phyllis Kirk) is helping Cathy get dressed for her evening out. Cathy expresses no sorrow for Burke, as she has found a new sugar daddy. Mrs. Flannigan (Riza Royce) confronts Sue upon her return from a job interview to get her back rent. Sue goes up to her room to get some money from Cathy. Cathy is dead and Jarrod is there in the room. She screams which brings the household upstairs. Sue leaves through an open window out onto the roof. Jarrod chases her down the street. She manages to slip him and calls for help at a house of an old friend. Mrs. Andrews (Angela Clarke) and her son Scott Andrews (Paul Picerni) bring her inside and she tells them Cathy was murdered and she saw the horrible visage of the murderer.The police investigate the murder at the rooming house. Lt. Tom Brennan (Frank Lovejoy) is lead and he is assisted by Sgt. Jim Shane (Dabbs Greer). The coroner (Frank Ferguson) determines Cathy\u0027s cause of death was strangulation. The surgeon (Grandon Rhodes) adds that she was drugged. Her body is taken to the morgue storage room where Jarrod is waiting under a sheet pretending to be a corpse. He\u0027s there to steal Cathy\u0027s body. With two accomplices below, he lowers her body out of a window with rope into a waiting hearse.The next morning, Mrs. Andrews, Scott and Sue come to the police station to give her report. Lt. Brennan tells them Cathy\u0027s body was stolen from the morgue. Before that, Mathew Burke\u0027s body and a few others were stolen from the morgue. He tells Sue not to leave town, but she is free to leave.Sidney Wallace is back in New York. He stops at a shop and is greeted by Igor (Charles Buchinsky/Bronson), a deaf-mute, and is escorted inside. Jarrod, looking as he did before the fire, greets Wallace sitting in a wheelchair. He tells Wallace he\u0027s rebuilding his exhibition from the ground up and will give the public what it wants, \"sensation, horror, shock.\" He adds, \"Crimes of violence will be reproduced in wax and exhibited while they are still fresh in the public mind.\" He is searching for a model for his new Marie Antoinette. He shows Wallace the basement with the wax body dip machinery. He asks Wallace to invest. He needs $30,000.The House of Wax opens for its debut. A man exits the lobby to work the crowd. The Barker (Reggie Rymal) has two paddle ball games. (Note: This was originally released as a Color 3-D movie.) He works the crowd into a frenzy by knocking things with the balls on the elastic. Jarrod greets Wallace and escorts him into the museum. He gives him the tour, along with some paying customers.Scott Andrews accompanies Sue on a tour of the Wax Museum. Wallace sees and recognizes Scott--he has been sponsoring him as a talented sculptor. Wallace wants to introduce Scott to Jarrod. While Sue wanders around she is surprised to see a Joan of Arc wax figure that looks exactly like her friend Cathy Gray. She climbs up on the tableaux to get a closer look. Jarrod sees this and approaches in his wheelchair. Sue asks, \"But why should it be so like Cathy?\" Jarrod responds, \"I think I can explain that.\" He tells her that he copied her face from newspaper clippings. Jarrod offers Scott a job, then tells Wallace he sees Marie Antoinette as Sue.Jarrod, without his makeup, goes to see Sue. He spies on her through her open window. She goes to bed. Jarrod steals into her room, but Sue wakes up and screams. Jarrod departs as Mrs. Andrews comes into her room to comfort her.Sue and Scott are at a Can-Can show having lunch. She is convinced there is something wrong about the Joan of Arc figure. Cathy had one ear pierced as does the wax figure. Such detail seems inconceivable. Scott tells Sue they\u0027ll talk to Lt. Brennan. Brennan listens to the story. To humor her, he agrees that the Police will investigate. He does confirm that someone matching Jarrod\u0027s description (with makeup) did ask to look at the photographs of Cathy\u0027s body. Brennan tells Sgt. Shane to check on Jarrod and his employees. They visit the Museum and examine the Joan of Arc. Sue stops by and climbs up on the wax figure again to touch the face. Jarrod catches her again. Jarrod shows Sue a wax head of herself. He tells her he needs her to model for his Marie Antoinette. Before Brennan and Shane leave, they notice some of the wax figures resemble people who have recently died. Shane also thinks he recognizes one of Jarrod\u0027s sculptors, Leon Averill (Nedrick Young).Wallace was waiting outside Brennan\u0027s office for Brennan and Shane to return. They arrive and ask him some questions about Jarrod. Before he leaves he vouches for Jarrod. Shane then remembers Leon as an artist imprisoned at Sing-Sing. He was then known as Hendricks and was an alcoholic. Brennan tells Shane to bring him in. They search his belongings at the station and find a watch that belonged to one of the bodies stolen from the morgue. Brennan tells Shane to book him on suspicion of murder.Jarrod sends Scott on an errand after he tells Jarrod Sue will be stopping by later. Sue enters the darkened Museum. Igor locks her in then follows her as she wanders around looking for Scott. She is drawn to the Joan of Arc and climbs back on the tableaux. She pulls back the black wig and finds Cathy\u0027s blond hair beneath. Jarrod tells her, \"You shouldn\u0027t have done that, my dear.\" Sue tells Jarrod, \"It\u0027s Cathy\u0027s body under the wax. I knew it. I knew it all the time.\" Jarrod gets up out of the wheelchair and walks towards her. She runs straight into Igor. She hits Jarrod about the head and his wax face breaks off revealing the scarred face below. She is taken to the basement where Jarrod fires up his wax machine.At police headquarters they are questioning Leon with alcohol as a bribe. He spills his guts and tells the police, \"The whole place is a morgue.\" The police race over to the House of Wax. Sue is shackled in a box with the hot wax shower threatening. Scott returns to the museum looking for Sue. Igor blocks the door to the workshop and he and Igor fight. Scott is knocked out. Igor places his body on the guillotine, but before he can operate the machine the police stop him. The police break down the door to the cellar. They fight with Jarrod on the bridge above the boiling vat of wax. Jarrod is knocked into the liquid and dies. Brennan moves the box Sue is shackled into away from the hot wax as the machinery explodes.The next morning Scott, Sue, Brennan and Shane meet in Brennan\u0027s office. We close with Brennan holding up the wax head of Igor.","Weighted Degree":"9.0","numvotes":"17867","productioncompany":"Bryan Foy Productions","countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"7.0","originaltitle":"House of Wax","size":"3","genres":"Horror Only","storyline":"Professor Henry Jarrod is a true artist whose wax sculptures are lifelike.

On the night of her arrival there is a torrential downpour. She arrives at the school by taxi, and before she can enter, she witnesses a young blonde girl (Eva Axén) fleeing the building in a panic. Suzy hears the girl shouting to someone just inside the door of the school, but the intense thunder obscures most of her words. When the other girl is gone, Suzy talks to an unidentified person on the school\u0027s intercom, but they refuse to let her inside. Unable to gain access to the school, Suzy gets back into her cab and has the driver take her away. As the cab drives through a nearby forest, Suzy sees Pat running alone through the trees that separate the school from town.The frightened girl is Pat Hingle, and she flees to a friend\u0027s apartment in the nearby town. While alone in the bathroom, she becomes transfixed by a pair of shining eyes outside the window, and a decidedly inhuman arm smashes through the glass, grabbing her. She is pulled out of the window onto the roof, stabbed numerous times, and then hanged by a cord when she falls through the sky light. The huge pieces of glass and metal that break out of the skylight fall on Pat\u0027s friend, killing her by impaling her body and her head in numerous places.Suzy goes to the school the next day and is greeted by Ms. Tanner (Alida Valli), an instructor, and Madame Blanc (Joan Bennett), the vice directress. Madame Blanc is very friendly to Suzy, especially when she realizes she knows Suzy\u0027s aunt Carol. Detectives are there investigating Pat\u0027s murder, and although Ms. Tanner tries to hurry Suzy away, Suzy volunteers a few bits of information. It seems as if there is something that she cannot remember, some realization that she can\u0027t put her finger on. Suzy meets a few other odd characters, including a strange looking handyman named Pavlo (Giuseppe Transocchi) and a blind pianist named Daniel (Flavio Bucci).In the changing room, Suzy meets two other students, Olga (Barbara Magnolfi) and Sara (Stefania Casini). Sara and Olga are not friends, and Olga taunts Sara a little. Although Suzy has requested to board at the school, the rooms are all full and it\u0027s been arranged for Suzy to live with Olga in her off-campus apartment. Although Olga initially seems very bitchy, she and Suzy get along well and have a conversation about Pat. Olga tells Suzy that Pat was a \"busybody\", and that she was always trying to find out things about other people. Suzy thinks back to seeing Pat the night before, and she suddenly remembers Pat shouting the words \"secret\" and \"iris\".The next day, Suzy sees Madame Blanc before classes, and she tells Suzy that her dorm room is now free. Suzy, however, tells Madame Blanc that she\u0027d rather live with Olga. Madame Blanc seems offended by this and walks away in a huff. Ms. Tanner sarcastically tells Suzy that she is happy she\u0027s so \"strong willed\". On her way to class immediately afterwards, Suzy passes by the cook, who is sitting in the hallway with Madame Blanc\u0027s small nephew Albert (Jacopo Mariani). The cook is polishing some silver, and she reflects a beam of sunlight at Suzy, who immediately begins to feel ill. In class, Ms. Tanner keeps pushing Suzy to dance, and Suzy passes out, bleeding from her nose and mouth.The school doctor (Renato Scarpa) puts Suzy on a restricted diet that includes cheese, fruit, and a glass of red wine. Suzy also finds that she\u0027s been moved into the dorms without her consent. Her dorm room is next to Sara\u0027s, and the two of them become friends. As the girls dress for dinner, hundreds of maggots start to fall from the ceiling. Ms. Tanner investigates the upper floor and finds that crates of spoiled food have caused the maggot infestation. Madame Blanc apologizes to the girls, and arranges for all of them to sleep in the practice hall. A wall of sheets separates the girls from the teachers, who are staying with the girls for the night. Suzy asks Sara if the teachers live in the school, but Sara tells her that they leave at 9:30 every night. When the girls sleep, a shadowy figure lays down on the other side of the sheet behind Suzy and Sara. The person has a very distinct, raspy, whistling snore and it frightens Sara, who wakes Suzy up. Sara tells her about a time last year when she had to sleep in a guest bedroom: late that night, she had heard the same snoring in the next room. Madame Blanc later told Sara that the school\u0027s directress stayed in that room, so the weird snoring means the directress is now here. This seems suspicious to Suzy and Sara, since all the girls have been told that the directress would not return to the school for weeks.The next morning, Sara asks Ms. Tanner if the directress showed up last night, but Ms. Tanner denies it. As classes start, Madame Blanc\u0027s young nephew, Albert, is attacked by Daniel\u0027s guide dog. Enraged, Ms. Tanner interrupts class and tells Daniel never to bring the dog back or she\u0027ll have it put to sleep. Daniel yells at her and insists his dog would never harm anyone. Ms. Tanner throws Daniel\u0027s cane to the floor and tells him to get out, humiliating him as he fumbles around trying to find it. Daniel is enraged, and makes a veiled threat to Ms. Tanner: he is blind, but not deaf. Ms. Tanner is furious.That night, after Suzy eats her meal Sara comes into her room and they listen while the teachers supposedly leave. However, Suzy notices that the footsteps are going away from the front door; therefore the teachers are not really leaving the school at all, but going someplace inside. Sara begins to wonder where they go, but Suzy becomes extremely drowsy and can hardly stay awake. Sara takes out a notebook and writes down the number of footsteps as the instructors walk by.Daniel, who has been out at a bar, leaves with his dog. While in the middle of an empty piazza, his dog begins to bark at something. Daniel tries to calm down the dog, but he just gets more restless as they walk. Daniel begins to become frightened and stops, hearing strange sounds that indicate to him someone else is there. We can also see shadowy figures moving in the distance. As Daniel waits silently in the piazza, his dog suddenly attacks and kills him, tearing out his throat.Suzy is troubled by the sudden number of deaths and approaches Madame Blanc. She tells Blanc that she heard Pat say something the night she died. Although Pat had said more, Suzy only heard \"secret\" and \"irises\". Madame Blanc says she will inform the police about Suzy\u0027s information, but Sara later gets angry that Suzy told this to Madame Blanc. Sara worries that Suzy\u0027s revelation has put the teachers on a hunt for whoever Pat was talking to that night, and that the teacher will obviously identify that person as herself. As the two go for a swim in the pool, Sara tells Suzy all about her friendship with Pat, and how Pat had been taking notes for months about strange occurrences at the school. However, when Sara is going to show them to Suzy that night, the notes are gone; now she knows that the evil forces in the school are onto her and her time is short. The only thing she has left is the list of footsteps she made. Sara tries to get Suzy to help her, but once again Suzy cannot stay awake. Sara begins to hear footsteps and flees Suzy\u0027s room just before an unseen person enters. Sara escapes to the attic, where she is attacked but hides in a room and latches the door shut. Her stalker tries to use a strait razor to unlatch the door. With nowhere else to go, Sara cowers away from the door when she notices a small window near the ceiling. Stacking several boxes on top of each other, she leaps through the window and into the next room; unfortunately, the small room is filled to the brim with large, unruly bushels of razor wire. She tries to escape to an open door a few feet away but keeps getting tangled and cut. Just as she is near the door, the killer slices her throat.The next morning, Suzy finds Sara\u0027s room empty. Ms. Tanner tells Suzy that Sara left early that morning without telling anyone. Suzy meets with a friend of Sara\u0027s, who turns out to be Sara\u0027s psychologist. He tells Suzy that Sara became troubled when a friend put the notion of witches in her head. Sara also found out that the school was founded by Helena Markos, a Greek émigré, who people thought was a witch. Markos was persecuted wherever she went, and she founded the school for the study of occult sciences and arts. However, Markos died in a fire, and the school was passed down to her favorite pupil who turned it from a school for the occult to a dance academy. Suzy talks to a colleague of Dr. Mandel who specializes in witches, Professor Milius. Milius explains to Suzy that witches are negative forces that change events only to do harm, and their goal is to gain personal wealth that can only be achieved by injury to others. He also tells her that a coven of witches can only do magic with the power of their queen. Otherwise, they are harmless.Back at school, Suzy finds out that all the students are gone. She asks a servant, who tells her that all the students went to the theater, and that Ms. Tanner got the tickets. Suzy tries to call Frank Mandel, but a storm knocks out the phones. In her room, Suzy dumps her food out, and throws the wine down the sink, which looks suspiciously like blood. Afterwards, she is attacked by a vicious bat that flies in the bathroom window. She begins to hear the teachers footsteps, and remembers counting them with Sara. Following the count, Suzy traces their path and ends up in Madame Blanc\u0027s empty office, where the footsteps stopped. With only one door, she knows the teachers exited somehow. Glancing into a mirror, she notices irises painted on the wall in the elaborate grotto illustration that adorns Madame Blanc\u0027s office. Suddenly Suzy remembers what she had forgotten. When exiting the school, Pat said \"The secret! I saw behind the door! Three irises! Turn the blue one!\"Suzy turns the blue iris and a hidden door pops open. She sneaks down a hallway and, hiding behind a curtain, she sees the entire coven meeting with Madame Blanc, who is sitting on a throne. She and the others discuss how they will kill Suzy. Conducting a black mass ritual, Madame Blanc partakes of some kind of communion wafer and says \"Queen Helena, give me power!\" Afraid they might find her, Suzy backs away and stumbles upon Sara\u0027s corpse. She flees into a connecting room, which turns out to be a bedroom. Asleep in the bed, obscured by sheer white curtains, is a shadowy figure, snoring loudly--the same weird snoring of the directress, whom Suzy now realizes is Helena Markos. Frightened, Suzy knocks over an ornamental statue which wakes up Helena Markos. In a horrible, raspy voice, Helena speaks to Suzy: \"The American girl! I knew you\u0027d come. You want to kill me!\" Suzy picks up one of the sharp glass feathers from the statue and pulls back the curtain of the bed only to find it empty. Confused, Suzy looks around while Markos taunts her. A door slowly opens, and Sara\u0027s corpse, back to life and wielding a knife, approaches Suzy. As lightning strikes, Suzy notices a slight outline of Markos still sitting there on the bed; she is simply invisible. Suzy stabs her through the neck. Sara disappears, and the burnt features of Markos become visible as she dies; the weapon has penetrated through her entire neck, and she chokes to death. Things in the bedroom begin to explode, and Suzy rushes out. As she passes by their meeting room, she sees Madame Blanc, Miss Tanner, and the others, all collapsed and bleeding due to the death of Markos. Suzy runs away, and everywhere she goes, power exudes from her, destroying all in her path. Doors explode outwards before she can touch them, and walls crack and break as she passes. Finally she reaches the exit and walks out into the rain as the house burns behind her. Suzy smiles cryptically as she walks away from the school. Perhaps she is simply happy to have escaped, or perhaps it is as the legend goes, that whoever kills a witch inherits her power.","Weighted Degree":"2.0","numvotes":"90183","productioncompany":"Seda Spettacoli","countriesoforigin":"Italy","averagerating":"7.4","originaltitle":"Suspiria","size":"1","genres":"Horror Only","storyline":"Suzy Bannion travels to Germany to perfect her ballet skills.

The next morning the cat is dead on the floor when Delia enters, Beth is asleep. Delia picks up the cat and takes it downstairs to Lachlan and shows him the dead cat. Beame is told to deal with Beth after breaksfast and get her ready. Delia \u0026 Lachlan talk about their religious beliefs, he looks at a portait on the wall and we are shown a flashback of him and his Grandfather (Christopher Lee) by the river talking about the Laddie and fate. Delia and Lachlan finish talking and the hunt for the Laddie begins. Beame (wearing traditional kilt) is climbing the stairs carrying a needle, he enters Beths room, but she wakes up as he approaches, she see the needle and struggles picking up some of the broken glass and stabbing in his testicles, he yells and she runs away knocking over the cook, through the house and outside. The hunt continues while Beame is having his injury seen to by the cook and they discuss where she\u0027d go. The hunt is still going and Steve is making good headway until his stirrup breaks (having been cut) making him fall from the horse. He gets up and begins to ride away, but Lolly has caught up and is calling to him. We see Beth running down a deserted road where she comes across Jack. She goes into his house and tries to use the phone but he is too incoherrent to help her. Suddenly Beame walks in, grabs her and takes her away. Lolly tels Steve it\u0027s a trap and to follow her, but he thinks it\u0027s just a so he ignores her. Steve arrives at the Castle just as the others are catching up. Beth is laid out face down, unconcious and naked on the kitchen table being brushed with oil by Cook. Beame, the cook and another villager (Mary?) talk amongst themselves about Beth and why she is being brushed in oil as the conversation carries on it is apparent that Sir Lachlan intends to eat her raw. Cook says she is sedated as Lachlan like them to be fresh as possible, then Beame gets upset as somebody has been messing with his collection of May Queen eyes. Steve is just getting to the castle, and Beth is being put in a store room still unconcious on a table. She begins to wake up and looks around. In the meantime Lanchlan and the other villagers enter the Castle where Steve is sitting on the throne as he was told. Steve is cocky at first, but starts to lose his bravado as the villagers surround the throne. As this is going on Beth puts on the May Queen dress and explores her surroundings. Lachlan begins to talk as the villagers start to strip off. Beth sees what appears to be statues of previous May Queens, but it starts to become apparent to her that they are not what they seem and she calls out. Lachlan and the villagers start to sing as the continue to strip in front of a confused Steve who doesn\u0027t seem to realise what is going on, suddenly realisation dawns as Lachlan begins to give praise to the Sun as the villagers descend. It is too late as the villagers grab Steve and begin to eat him alive, Lolly is outside sobbing and we see the villagers dancing and feasting in praise.As Beth looks at the statues, the Cook is listening to the radio and rather drunk, you can hear Beth calling and banging to be let out. Delia is seen after bathing Steves blood off and hears Beth yelling. Beth touches a statue and the outside cracks away revealing a skeletal hand underneath, she runs for a door that leads her outside, it\u0027s locked but she manages to escape through a window. She runs and bumps into Lolly, who tells her Steve is dead, Beth can\u0027t beleive it and Lolly tries to get her to go away with her she refuses even though Lolly makes it clear to her that she will be killed. Beth walks on up a hill to where the Wicker Tree stands, Lachlan is singing as the villagers dance around in praise. Beth walks through them and them seem not to see her and suddenly Lachlan is made aware that the Queen is there, he looks surprised but begins to explain when she asks about Steve. She asks Danny (a villager) who confirms he is dead, very quickly as Lachlan continues to talk Beth shoves him into the Wicker Tree where he burns alive. She tells the villagers to sing, they join in and then disperse back to the village. Beth is left alone and trying to find a way out of the village when she comes across the little boy who offers to lead to the next village. As they walk, the villagers start to appear behind her. She is suddenly grabbed by them. Lolly gives birth to a baby, they proclaim as their little cowboy.The end shot is of Beth in full May Queen regalia - despite her efforts she has suffered the same fate as the other May Queens before her.","Weighted Degree":"4.0","numvotes":"2672","productioncompany":"British Lion Film Corporation","countriesoforigin":"United Kingdom","averagerating":"3.8","originaltitle":"The Wicker Tree","size":"2","genres":"Drama,Horror","storyline":"Young Christians Beth and Steve, a gospel singer and her cowboy boyfriend, leave Texas to preach door-to-door in Scotland .

As a means of coping with these recurring nightmares and at the request of his girlfriend Lori (Anne Bobby), Boone is seeing psychotherapist Dr. Phillip K. Decker (David Cronenberg), who convinces Boone that he has committed a series of gruesome murders. In reality, Decker is a serial killer who dons a grotesque mask and has been murdering several families, all whom he sees as disgusting \"breeders\". Decker attempts to pin the blame for his killing spree on Boone. He gives Boone a bottle of lithium (actually a hallucinogenic substance) and twenty four hours to turn himself in. Boone wanders the streets in a hallucinogenic haze. He is hit by a truck and taken to a hospital.In the hospital, Boone overhears the drug-addled cries of Narcisse (Hugh Ross), who is waiting for the monsters to take him to Midian. Narcisse, led to believe Boone is a messenger from Midian sent to test him, tells Boone the way, before tearing the skin from his face with a pair of razors, in order to show his \"true face\". Boone escapes the hospital and makes his way to Midian, an entire city standing under a massive graveyard. Boone encounters two supernatural creatures named Kinski (Nicholas Vince) and Peloquin (Oliver Parker) who inhabit the city. Kinski says they should take him below but Peloquin states that whereas they are \"Nightbreed\", Boone is a \"natural\" and thinks he should die. Boone pleads with them, claiming he is a murderer and hence belongs with the monsters, but Peloquin says he can smell innocence. Peloquin transforms himself into a more monstrous state and bites Boone on the shoulder intending to devour him, but Boone manages to escape and leaves the graveyard, only to run into an entire squad of police officers waiting outside the gate with Decker. Decker tries to get Boone to surrender and suddenly yells that Boone has a gun. Boone is then gunned down by the police. At the morgue, Boone comes back to life due to Peloquin\u0027s bite becoming a Nightbreed. He makes his way back to Midian where Narcisse has also returned to. Boone is schooled in the laws of Midian and is inducted into Midian\u0027s society by Dirk Lylesburg (Doug Bradley), the leader of the Nightbreed. Lylesburg dips his hand into blood of Baphomet (the deity of Midian) and presses it to Boone\u0027s chest, completing his induction ceremony.Lori, seeking to understand why Boone left her, resolves to investigate Midian for herself. She befriends a woman named Sheryl Anne (Debora Weston) and drives out to the cemetery. She wanders into the cemetery, leaving Sheryl Anne waiting at the car. She finds a dying creature out in the sunlight and at the pleading request of a Nightbreed woman named Rachel (Catherine Chevalier), picks it up and takes it into the shadows, where it transforms into a little girl who happens to be Rachel\u0027s daughter Babette, who is sensitive to sunlight. Lori asks after Boone, only to be rebuffed by Lylesburg, who assures her that Boone is now Nightbreed, and hence no longer part of her world. Lori tries to make her way into Midian but is scared off by Peloquin. As she leaves the cemetery, she is greeted by the sight of Sheryl Anne\u0027s dead body and her new boyfriend, who reveals himself as Decker. He tries to kill Lori in an attempt to bring Boone out of hiding. Decker chases Lori back into the cemetery where he knocks Lori unconscious. Before he can kill her however, Boone appears. Decker stabs him only to learn that Boone cannot be killed due to his supernatural transformation. Decker manages to escape and Boone takes Lori into Midian, where she regains consciousness deep inside the city. Lori is told of the history of Midian by Rachel: the monsters of lore were peaceful beings, hunted to near extinction by frightened and superstitious humans. Boone and Lori are then banished from Midian by Lylesburg. Meanwhile, Decker interrogates a local mechanic who once wanted to join the Nightbreed and learns how they can die. He then murders the residents of the hotel where Boone and Lori are staying. Boone finds the murder scene. Unable to control his thirst for blood, Boone takes a taste. The police find him and take him into custody. At Decker\u0027s urging, the local police and militia led by a bloodthirsty police captain named Eigerman (Charles Haid) form up a small army to attack Midian. They release a drunken priest named Ashberry (Malcolm Smith) to serve them as God\u0027s servant in the battle. Lori, Rachel, and Narcisse race to the jail to release Boone. Lori shows Boone that she loves him even as a \"monster\". The four head back to Midian where Boone convinces the scared Nightbreed to fight back.During the battle, Ashberry is horrified to learn that there are women and children among the Nightbreed and tries to stop the attack, but is roughly beaten down by Eigerman. Ashberry then finds the statue of Baphomet. He drops his cross and Bible and moves forward to swear allegiance, but is splashed and severely burned by the blood of Baphomet and transformed. The Nightbreed manages to fight back, but Boone learns from Lylesburg that Baphomet is going to destroy all of Midian. He tells Lylesburg to release the Berserkers, a monstrous, feral breed that were imprisoned due to their sheer insanity. Lylesburg attempts to open the cages but is killed, leaving Boone to release them. The Beserkers attack the humans furiously, turning the tide of the battle as the humans flee in fear. Boone and Decker then face each other in the burning wreckage of Midian. The two fight and Boone kills him. Boone then goes to Baphomet (Bernard Henry), who says that he has caused the end of Midian, but also that this was foretold. Baphomet charges Boone with finding a new home for the Nightbreed and renames him \"Cabal.\" Boone makes his way out of Midian with Lori. The remaining Nightbreed meet in an old barn. Boone says his goodbyes to Narcisse promising that he will not forget the Nightbreed and that he will find a place where they will all be safe.Meanwhile in the ruins of Midian, Ashberry stands in front of Decker\u0027s corpse and states that he wants to exact vengeance on Baphomet and the Breed. He takes some of the blood of Baphomet and pushes it into Decker\u0027s chest wound. Decker suddenly springs back to life with a scream as Ashberry chants \"Hallelujah\" over and over again.Alternate endingIn an alternate ending (as used by The Cabal Cut of the movie), the Nightbreed await Boone in a barn whilst Boone says his goodbyes to Lori as he must venture the world to find a new home for them, but he promises to return to her. Lori, fearing she will be elderly when the time comes whilst Boone will retain his youth, stabs herself and dies. Boone is forced into resurrecting her into another Nightbreed. At first the revival doesn\u0027t seem to work, but it is eventually successful.Elsewhere, Captain Eigerman wanders the underground remains where he stumbles upon the transformed Ashberry who desires revenge. Eigerman shares this desire, but Ashberry rejects him and kills Eigerman and begins his hunt for the Nightbreed.","Weighted Degree":"3.0","numvotes":"22535","productioncompany":"Morgan Creek Entertainment","countriesoforigin":"United States, United Kingdom, Canada","averagerating":"6.5","originaltitle":"Nightbreed","size":"1","genres":"Action,Fantasy,Horror","storyline":"A community of mutant outcasts of varying types and abilities attempts to escape the attention of a psychotic serial killer and redneck vigilantes with the help of a brooding young man who discovers them.

Six unruly prep school students are forced to serve Saturday detention for eight hours at Crestview Academy, where psychologist Dr. Day (Jeffrey Schmidt) conducts psychological testing on the students to examine their personalities and trigger their demeanors, recording each session in the process. Despite receiving an expulsion notice from Headmaster Nash (Judd Nelson), a new low-income student Matt Clark (Cameron Deane Stewart) plans to compensate for his poor behavior by joining the awkward Tarek Ahmed (Marc Donato), the jock Craig Cook (Roger Edwards), the sly Goth girl Veronica Harmon (Augie Duke), the prissy and asthmatic Megan McDurst (Amanda Alch), and the popular girl Tricia Wilkes (Ali Faulkner) in detention.   After giving them the task to complete a school history assignment, Dr. Day restricts their internet reach and takes away many of their phones, leaving the students imprisoned alone in the library, remodeled by the janitor, Max (Ben Browder), with Native American portraits and an Apache statue. The students believe the library is haunted. They realize they have mutually dysfunctional family lives, though they have their differences with each other, sparked from prior encounters which have been recorded on camera. They all try to break out of the library, but they are sealed in. Behaving mischievous, Veronica hides Megans inhaler and frames Tarek, leading to Megan having a shortness of breath and dying before its found.   Getting the internet to work, Veronica does her research. They discover an old, deceased Indian, Jacob Rainwater, once owned land that was stolen from the Apache tribe in the 1870s by a General, Andrew Winston Clarke, before it was taken over by the city of Crestview to build the school. As the students argue on-and-off, they find a vent to navigate to different rooms that have its doors locked on both sides. Thereby, they learn Matt has an undisclosed criminal background and become suspicious of him. After Tarek goes missing and they return to the library through the vent, they discover Tricias powerful mother is the Governor, Craigs father is the city councilman, and Megan\u0027s father co-owns the property of which Tareks father is responsible for building the library, all of who made an agreement with the school to ensure their spoiled kids would be guaranteed to graduate in exchange for the construction of the library.   A dark storm rages on outside the school, tampering with the lights and electronics inside, increasing the students fear of the paranormal. In an accident, Craig falls down the steps in the library and is mysteriously staked by one of his crutches, dying instantly. Not long after, Tricia admits her mother was the reason why Jacob lost his house, and Veronica secures evidence on Craigs camera showing that Tricia, Craig, Megan and Tarek had killed Jacob at his home to vacate the ownership of the property, leaving no next of kin to take over. Deeply believing in ghosts, they attempt to contact Jacobs spirit so that Tricia can call a truce, but the spirit rebels and seemingly harms Veronica. The spirit then appears, and she uses a nail gun to commit suicide due to fright.   Shortly after, Dr. Day emerges to reveal his alliance with Veronica. The whole time, they masterminded everyone\u0027s paranormal delusions and emotional outbursts, triggered by psychological tests (inkblots), all to sell the story and make money. Killed by Dr. Day for trying to escape through the vent, Tarek\u0027s dead body is what was used as the ghost. Before Veronica can shoot Matt using the nail gun, Dr. Day abruptly kills her with an axe for poisoning him and causing his diarrhea earlier. Matt is framed for all the murders, as an unexpected booby trap involving the statue severs Dr. Day\u0027s head, killing him. A SWAT team barges in to find Matt armed with an axe in the middle of the carnage. Matt is subdued and placed in a straitjacket. Max arrives, revealing his Apache ancestor, Jacob Rainwater, owned the house where the school now stands, which at one time was also taken by General Clark and his army over a century ago. In the closing credits, Matt is driven away in an ambulance and Tricia\u0027s Governor mother, Tareks father and Craigs father pay off Max in order to clear them of any involvement in the incident.","Weighted Degree":"3.0","numvotes":"3705","productioncompany":"BKGTH Productions","countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"4.5","originaltitle":"Bad Kids Go to Hell","size":"1","genres":"Comedy,Horror,Mystery","storyline":"The Breakfast Club meets The Grudge in this sexy, dark comedy-thriller!

Merrin has a sense of foreboding and encounters a number of strange omens, including the unearthing of a series of confusing items, a near miss with a runaway horse drawn carriage, and a clock that stops ticking in mid-stroke. Finally, Merrin discovers a statue of a bizarre demonic figure; although the film does not mention it, it is a representation of a demonic figure known as Pazuzu.Back in the United States, in Washington D.C.\u0027s upscale Georgetown neighborhood, a successful actress named Chris McNeil (Ellen Burstyn) begins experiencing strange phenomena. Chris lives with her twelve-year-old daughter Regan (Linda Blair), her personal assistant Sharon (Kitty Wynn), and two housekeepers. Regan\u0027s father is estranged for reasons unknown. There are mysterious, unexplained sounds in the attic of the house, which Chris attributes to rats. Regan slowly begins to exhibit strange behavior, undergoing behavioral changes much like depression and anxiety. She turns up in Chris\u0027s bed one night, complaining that her own bed was \"shaking\".Chris is working on a new movie in Georgetown with a director known as Burke Dennings (Jack MacGowran). While filming a scene one day, she notices a young Catholic priest watching her; his name is Damien Karras (Jason Miller). Father Karras has a background in psychology and counsels parishoners at a nearby church; Chris also notices him while walking home from the shoot one day.Karras is a thoughtful, conflicted man. He discusses his vocation with a superior and asks to be transferred because he feels he is losing his faith. He also has an elderly mother who lives alone in a slum in New York; he visits her and is reminded of how lonely her life is, and he feels guilty that she has to live in such poor surroundings.The strange occurrences in the McNeil house begin to increase. Regan reveals that she has been playing with a Ouija board and claims that she has the ability to communicate with a spiritual entity all by herself. A nearby Catholic church is desecrated, a statue of the Virgin Mary painted crudely and adorned with conical clay additions made to resemble breasts and a penis. Regan also works with clay and paint, making small animal sculptures.Meanwhile, Father Karras\u0027s mother falls ill and, due to a lack of funds, she is placed in a very shabby hospital and resigned to a ward full of mental patients. Father Karras is distraught when he visits her and she seems to blame him for her situation. Later, she passes away under these conditions, adding to his sorrow.Chris has an elaborate party at her home with a number of affluent guests. One of her guests is another Jesuit named Father Dyer (Rev. William O\u0027Malley), and Chris asks him about Karras, having noticed him and referring to him as \"intense\". She finds that Karras and Dyer are good friends. During the party, Regan appears happy and social, but she reappears after being sent to bed, dressed in her nightgown and urinates on the carpet in front of the guests while making an ominous statement to a prominent astronaut (\"You\u0027re gonna die up there\"). After the guests leave, Chris bathes Regan and puts her to bed, but is startled by a loud sound from Regan\u0027s bedroom. She rushes back down the hall and discovers Regan\u0027s bed shaking violently, rising up off the floor with Regan on it. Chris jumps on the bed and it still levitates.Chris subjects Regan to a series of medical tests to discover what the problem is. The doctors are unable to discover anything, despite putting Regan through some grueling, painful procedures. The best they can come up with is that Regan may have a lesion on her brain, but ultimately they are frustrated when nothing appears on her brain scan. At Chris\u0027s house, Regan suffers what appears to be a seizure, and two doctors visit to assist. They find her rising and falling up and down on the bed in a way that seems impossible for a human being. When they try to sedate her, she hurls them across the room with abnormal strength, speaking to them in what seems to be a male voice: \"Keep away! The sow is mine!\" Eventually they sedate her.Out of options, they advise Chris to search for a psychiatrist, but they also reluctantly discuss another possibility: they mention the phenomenon of demonic possession and the rite of exorcism. While they seem to hold professional contempt for it, they do admit that it has been known to solve problems such as what Regan is going through. Chris is skeptical, having no real religious affiliation of her own.The situation worsens when Chris is out one evening; she returns to find the house deserted except for Regan, who is alone in her bedroom and appears to be in deep sleep. The bedroom is freezing cold, the window standing wide open, and she is uncovered. Sharon returns and Chris is furious with her for leaving Regan unattended, but Sharon explains that she left Regan in the care of Burke, who was visiting the house, while she went to the pharmacy to get Regan\u0027s medication. Burke\u0027s absence is unexplained until the doorbell rings and an associate of Chris\u0027s breaks the news that Burke has just died on the steps outside Chris\u0027s house.Shortly after this, Chris is visited by a kindly detective named Kinderman (Lee J. Cobb), who seems suspicious of Burke\u0027s death. He questions Chris about the events of that evening, and Chris is nervous, hesitant to tell him about Regan\u0027s problem. While he is visiting, he notices a few small animal figures that Regan has crafted; they are similar in style to the desecration of the statue in the church. Kinderman leaves and immediately a violent disturbance comes from Regan\u0027s bedroom. Chris hears a deep male voice bellowing at Regan to \"do it\", and Regan screaming in protest. In the bedroom, Chris finds Regan plunging a crucifix violently into her vagina. When Chris tries to stop her, Regan assaults her with impossible strength, and furniture around the room starts to move on its own. As Chris watches in horror, her daughter\u0027s head turns completely around backwards, and she speaks to Chris in Burke\u0027s voice, saying to her \"Do you know what she did? Your cunting daughter??\" Chris then realizes that Regan is responsible for Burke\u0027s death.Desperate, Chris arranges to meet with Father Karras, and when she mentions the notion of exorcism, Karras is almost amused. He tells her that exorcism is nearly unheard of, and that he doesn\u0027t know anybody who has ever performed one. Chris is distraught and convinces him to meet with Regan anyway. Karras is shocked by the girl\u0027s appearance; she is tied to the headboard of her bed, her face misshapen and covered in lesions, her voice deep and gravelly. Regan announces that she\u0027s the devil, and toys with Karras in a number of ways, seeming to make a drawer next to the bed open all by itself, then speaking to Karras in a number of languages. She also conjures up the voice of a subway vagrant that Karras has encountered alone earlier. Karras remains unconvinced, and when Regan claims \"Your mother\u0027s in here with us\", Karras asks her what his mother\u0027s maiden name is. Unable to answer, Regan vomits spectacularly all over him.Chris cleans Karras\u0027s sweater and discusses Regan with him. Karras is still not convinced that Regan is possessed, especially because Regan says she\u0027s \"the devil\", and he recommends psychiatric care for her. Chris pleads with him to help her obtain an exorcism, swearing that the \"thing\" in the bed upstairs is not her daughter.While Karras thinks it over, he is approached by Kinderman, who questions him about the fact that the desecration of the church could be connected to Burke\u0027s death; what he was unable to tell Chris was that Burke\u0027s body was found with his head turned completely around backwards, and the police department considers it a homicide. Kinderman knows that Karras suspects something unusual about the McNeil house, but his confidentiality as a priest prevents him from discussing it with Kinderman.Karras visits Regan again and records their conversation, during which he sprinkles Regan with water. He tells her it is holy water and she begins to writhe in pain, seemingly going into a trance and speaking in a strange language. Later he tells Chris that it will be difficult to make a case with the Bishop for possession; the water he sprinkled on Regan was simply tap water, and was not blessed. The Bishop, and Karras himself, would consider Regan to be mentally ill and not possessed. Chris confides in Karras and tells him that Regan was the one who killed Burke Dennings. Later, Karras uses his tape recordings of Regan\u0027s seemingly incomprehensible babble to discover that she is really speaking backwards, in English. A phone call from Sharon interrupts him; she summons him to the house to see Regan, not wanting Chris to see that\u0027s happening: as they look at Regan\u0027s unconscious body, the words \"help me\" begin to materialize on her stomach, rising up in her skin like scar tissue.Karras reluctantly agrees to try and get an exorcism for Regan, although he seems to have more in common with the doctors who recommended it as a form of shock therapy. The church calls in Father Merrin to perform the exorcism, with Karras assisting. Merrin has performed exorcisms in the past, including a difficult one that \"nearly killed him\", according to the Bishop. When Merrin arrives at the McNeil house, Regan bellows his name from upstairs, as if she knows him, and she makes strange animal sounds. He warns Karras about conversing with the demon, and reminds him that the demon will mix lies with the truth to confuse and attack them.When they enter Regan\u0027s bedroom, she immediately begins with a string of obscenities. Merrin and Karras recite the ritual of exorcism and Regan manifests strange phenomena such as levitation, telekinesis, an abnormally long tongue, and strange vomiting. She constantly curses the priests and emits evil laughter and verbal abuse. Regan begins to talk to Karras in the voice of his mother, and he starts to break down. Merrin sends him away; when he returns, he finds Merrin dead on the floor, the victim of a heart attack. Regan cackles gleefully, infuriating Karras, who grabs her and shouts at the demon, \"Come into me! Take me!\" The transference works almost immediately; Karras begins to transform and Regan returns to her normal self. Before Karras can harm her, his \"normal\" personality breaks through for a split second and he commits suicide, hurling himself out Regan\u0027s window. Just as Burke did, he tumbles down the stairs outside Regan\u0027s window and lays dying in the street below. By chance, Father Dyer happens upon the scene and administers the last rites to his friend.In a brief epilogue, we see Chris and Regan as they prepare to leave the house in Georgetown. They are visited by Father Dyer. Chris speaks with him privately and tells him that Regan doesn\u0027t remember anything about the possession or the exorcism. Regan then appears and greets him cheerfully, transfixed by Father Dyer\u0027s white collar. Before they leave, she suddenly hugs Father Dyer and kisses him. As Chris pulls away in their car, she orders the driver to stop for a moment and gives Father Dyer the religious medallion that belonged to Father Karras; in their struggle, Regan had torn it from his body and it was in her bedroom all along.","Weighted Degree":"3.0","numvotes":"387907","productioncompany":"Warner Bros.","countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"8.1","originaltitle":"The Exorcist","size":"1","genres":"Horror Only","storyline":"A visiting actress in Washington, D.C., notices dramatic and dangerous changes in the behavior and physical make-up of her 12-year-old daughter.

The next day, the woman is found murdered. The third mysterious killing in several months.Sam Dalmas (Tony Musante) is an American writer currently living in Rome with his model girlfriend Julia (Suzy Kendall). Sam meets with Carlo (Renato Romano) who gives him a check for his most recent gig. But after two years of not writing anything, Sam is practically broke. He tells Carlos that he plans to leave Italy and return to the USA with Julia. On his way home that night, Sam passes a small art gallery where he witnesses the attack of a woman (Eva Renzi) by a mysterious black-gloved assailant dressed in a raincoat. Attempting to reach her, Sam is trapped between two mechanically-operated glass doors and can only watch as the villain makes his escape after stabing the woman.Eventually the police arrive and Sam discusses what he saw to Inspector Morosini (Enrico Maria Salerno). Sam says that he knows where was something odd about the scene, but he cannot place what\u0027s wrong about it. The police take Sam to the police station where they interrogate him all night. In the morning, Sam is permitted to leave, but Morosini takes his passport because he considers Sam an important witness and must not leave Italy. Morosini tells Sam that they have been three unresolved murders and that a \"dangerous maniac\" is loose in Rome. Sam phones the airport to cancel his airplane reservation and heads back to his apartment. On his way back, someone swings a meat cleaver at his head, but an elderly woman on the street warns him just in time. The black raincoat killer flees before Sam can identify him.Later that day, Sam goes back to the police station to report his attack and he is told that a black-leather glove was found at the crime scene and has been analyzed. Apparently, the attacker was left-handed and a smoker. Sam goes to the hospital to visit the woman who was attacked whom is Monica Ranieri (Eva Renzi), the wife of the gallery\u0027s owner Alberto Ranieri (Umberto Raho). Alberto asks Sam for a cigarette and Sam tosses his pack to Alberto who catches it with his left hand.A few days later, the unseen killer is seeking out additional women to kill by staking out the local racetrack. Meanwhile, Sam and Julia research the previous victims. Sam visits an antique shop where the first victim worked, and the flamboyantly gay owner tells Sam that a painting was sold that night of the woman\u0027s disappearance. The owner lets Sam borrow a black-and-white copy of the painting which consists of a woman being attacked in the snow of a local park.Morosini visits Sam at his home and tells him about the most recent murder and takes him to the police station. There, Morosini returns Sam\u0027s passport. By now, Sam has decided to stay and investigate the killings by himself. Morosini tells Sam that he will have a police detective follow the writer around for protection since the killer now is after him for seeing the attempt on Monica Ranieri. After Sam visits Alberto again at his home near the art gallery, Monica is there having returned home from the hospital and thanks him for saving her life. Next, Sam goes to a local prison where the second victim\u0027s pimp is there serving time where he asks information about the killer.That evening, Sam and Julia are walking down a dark street with the police detective tailing them, a black car appears and runs over the detective. While the black-clad unseen driver heads off, the car\u0027s passenger, a strange-looking man in a yellow jacket (Reggie Nalder) jumps out and pursues the couple with a gun. Julia gets away, but Sam is chased by both the yellow jacket assasin on foot and the black-jacket killer in the black car. After a chase through the streets and a local junkyard, Sam runs out onto a busy street. Sam realizes that the yellow jacket killer will not kill him with witnesses around, Sam then becomes the pursuer. But he loses the yellow jacket assasin who ducks into a hotel meeting room full of yellow jacket men.The next day, Sam visits the pimp in jail again who tells him that he knows a man who can help. Soon after, another man arrives at Sam\u0027s apartment and after he is given money, says he will contact Sam later to find out the idenity of the yellow jacket man who chased him. Then, the killer phones Sam and Julia at their apartment and threatens to kill them. The killer also phones the police station and taunts Morosini with planing to do more killings. Sam and Julia visit the police station where they listen to the recorded phone call where they hear a mysterious creaking sound in the background.The hired man returns to Sam\u0027s apartment and give him the name and address of the yellow-jacketed shooter. Sam goes to the small aparment of \u0027Needles\u0027, but finds the assasin dead from an apparent drug overdose. Later, Sam and Morosini are told by a voice annalyst that Sam\u0027s recorded call and an phone call to the police station placed to Morosini were made by two seperate people. Sam\u0027s friend Carlo hears the background noise and says that it sounds familiar. He takes the tape to listen some more. Meanwhile, the killer strikes again and kills another woman, named Tina, who returns to her apartment after an outing with her boyfriend.When Sam and Julia agree that things have gone too far for them, they make plans to return to America. But the next flight will not be until two days from now. Sam decides to visit the painter of the eerie painting, who lives in a run-down house on the outskirts of Rome. The eccentric artist tells Sam that he witnesses the event of the assault on the girl from over 10 years ago. Back in Rome, Julia is alone in Sam\u0027s apartment when the unseen killer pays her a threatening visit. Sam returns just in time, and Julia is saved, but the killer has already fled yet again.The next day, Carlo arrives where he tells them that he has finally identified the background noise on the tape which is the sound of a rare bird that can only live in Northern Siberia, and the only one that resides in Rome is in the local zoo. Sam and the police arrive at the zoo and realize that it is near the apartment of Alberto and Monica. When they burst into the apartment, the couple are struggling over a knife. When the police intervene, Alberto flees and falls out a window to his death on the street below. As he is dying after the fall, he admits to being the murderer.With the case apparently wraped up, Sam cannot find Julia who had run out of Alberto\u0027s apartment with Carlo and Monica. When Sam tracks them down to a small apartment a few blocks away (the same apartment the killer resides in), he finds Carlo dead and a bound and gagged Julia on the floor. Sam turns around and sees a snickering and wild-eyed Monica holding a knife. At this point, Sam finally remembers what he saw that night: it was not Monica being attacked but it was her husband Alberto trying to stop an attack on HIM! Sam chases Monica through the dark hallways and it leads right back to the art gallery where it all started. Monica drops a heavy sculpture down on Sam, pinning him to the floor. Before she can utilize her knife, the police arrive and subdue Monica.It is revealed by Inspector Morosini that Monica was a victim of a sexual assault and lived with the trauma of it for many years. In a transference-of-guilt, Monica imposed upon herself as the assailent and killed all those women as a way of re-enacting the assault on her and her loyal husband Alberto covered up for her and was the one trying to kill Sam to prevent him from finding out of his wife\u0027s murderous activities.

Shortly after she takes their picture, she notices the letter \"V\" missing out of the ride name, but thinks nothing of it. As the beginning of the movie progresses, we\u0027re introduced to several characters, including Wendy\u0027s boyfriend Jason Wise (Jesse Moss), her best friend Carrie Dreyer (Gina Holden), and her boyfriend Kevin Fischer (Ryan Merriman), as well as several other characters; the jock Lewis Romero (Texas Battle), the valley-girlesque Ashley Freund and Ashlyn Halperin (Chelan Simmons and Crystal Lowe), the social outcasts Ian McKinley and Erin Ulmer (Kris Lemche and Alexz Johnson), as well as Wendy\u0027s attitude-laden sister Julie (Amanda Crew) and the troublesome alumnus Frankie Cheeks (Sam Easton). Before the premonition, the hydraulic pump beneath Lewis Romero\u0027s seat begins to leak when a roller coaster attendant secures his seat restraint. The premonition begins when Wendy Christensen has sat herself toward the back of the roller coaster and pulls her digital camera out to snap a photo. The moment the camera takes the picture, a roller coaster attendant waves his hand in front of her, ruining the photo. He points to a sign explaining that no cameras or loose articles can remain on the ride. Kevin suggests that he put her camera in a pocket inside of his jacket. A few rows ahead, Frankie Cheeks overhears the attendant and conceals his video camera inside of his jacket. Kevin becomes excited for the ride until he withdraws his hand from the handlebar in front of him after getting his fingers stuck in sticky gum left by a previous passenger. The attendants give the OK to start the ride, and the roller coaster begins its ascension to the top of the initial drop. As the ride progresses, the leaking hydraulic line rattles and loosens. While going through a loop, Frankie yells at Ashley Freund and Ashlyn Halperin to flash him. Annoyed, Ashlyn slaps the camera out of Frankie\u0027s hand, which magically catches onto and wraps around the tracks at the bottom of the loop. The coaster runs over the camera, which loosens a wheel on the left side of the front cart, and severs the hydraulic line and unlocks all of the safety restraints, threatening the lives of all of the passengers. As the roller coaster continues along the tracks, the front left wheel pops off, showering sparks onto the passengers. As the passengers scream in terror, they attempt to remain in their seats while the coaster runs through corkscrews, hills, and sharp turns. More pieces from the coaster train break off. As the coaster hops over a hill and makes a sharp turn, the force causes carts one through three to separate from carts four through six. The front three carts fly off the tracks, killing Carrie Dreyer, Jason Wise, Ashley, Ashlyn, Frankie, and five others. Lewis is thrown out of his seat but manages to hang onto the coaster for dear life as it travels through more corkscrews. He loses his grip and is flung toward the back of the coaster where he is narrowly saved by Kevin Fischer. As Kevin catches Lewis, his seat restraint breaks away. Kevin manages to hang onto Lewis before a metal covering from the cart in which Lewis sat breaks away and smashes into him, sending him flying into a steel support beam, snapping his spine in half and causing a part of the support beam to jut out over a portion of the roller coaster tracks. The piece of metal that hit Lewis smashes onto another portion of the roller coaster tracks, causing the tracks to become uneven. The roller coaster continues to bunny hop toward another large loop, where, as it ascends toward the top of the loop, it begins to slow to a stop due to the train\u0027s missing wheel grinding against the tracks. The coaster becomes stuck upside down at the top of the loop. Erin Ulmer and Ian McKinley fall from their seats but are able to hang on to their restraints. Shortly after, they lose their grip, and Ian falls to his death, followed by Erin. Two unseen characters, later revealed to be Perry Malinowski and Julie Christensen, fall out of their seats to their deaths as well. Kevin and Wendy attempt to get the coaster out of the loop by rocking it backward. They succeed, but in the process, Kevin gets his coat stuck on a broken piece of his missing seat restraint as the coaster goes backward. The piece of support beam that juts out over the tracks from when Lewis was killed slices through Kevin\u0027s torso, cutting him in half. Wendy screams in horror and cries before the coaster hits the dislodged portion of the track. The train scorpion-tails backward as it is ripped off from the tracks and falls to the ground. Wendy is thrown out of her seat as the coaster falls, and she is killed when she lands on another portion of tracks below and it is then revealed that the derailment was a vision of Wendy\u0027s, and the roller coaster is still at its station. She panics and the roller coaster attendants release the seat restraints only in carts four through six, allowing several of the students off before a large fight ensues. Ashley and Ashlyn get off the ride, followed by Frankie who is videotaping them. Jason attempts to leave the coaster, but can\u0027t get the attention of the ride operator due to the fight. The remaining passengers begin to chant \"Hey! Ho! Let\u0027s go!\", prompting the ride operator to start the ride. As a security guard leads Wendy and the other students toward the exit of the ride, Wendy notices Jason and Carrie are still in the roller coaster. Panicked, she runs back to the ride platform and tells the attendants to stop the ride his screams \"Stop it! No! Stop it! Stop it! Please! Please, the tracks are broken. Stop! Stop! Please! Jason!\", but is forced outside of the ride exit. As Wendy and Kevin are escorted away on security guard word Voice tell \"Hey, just relax, OK Please Ease up, man. She\u0027s all right. OK Just let her settle down. She can settle down at home Now listen what is your home phone number OK, we\u0027re gonna call your mother. Everything will be taken care of......\" from the ride, the roller coaster crashes, killing Jason, Carrie and five others along with Wendy start cries word voice tell \"Jason!\".Several weeks later, Wendy is at the school and is confronted by Kevin, concerned about her and the loss of Jason and Carrie. Wendy insists to be left alone. Ashley and Ashlyn invite her to a tanning session, and she takes their phone number. As she makes her way to her car, Kevin explains that this has happened before, with flight 180 and the seven people who got off and mysteriously died. Wendy drives off as thunder booms overhead.Ashley and Ashlyn head over to their favorite tanning salon, hoping to bronze up for the graduation. They both have slurpees, and the owner insists they throw them away, as he heads off to complete a phone call. Ashley merely pretends to throw her drink away, and they both head to the tanning room, where they proceed to disrobe. Ashley sets her drink right above a cooling unit of the tanning beds. She also reaches for a CD, leaning on a shelf and slightly loosening it on the side. The owner heads out the door, with only a tube of lotion holding it open. However, the lotion squirts out, and the door closes shut and locks.Meanwhile, Wendy is looking over the photos she took the night of the accident, after promising Julie to borrow the camera to her. Julie lends her a bracelet left behind as a family heirloom. It\u0027s then she notices a photo of Jason with a foreshadowing of the coaster behind him as it is about to hit his head, and gets an eerie feeling as the light bulb dims in and out. She then looks at the picture of Ashley and Ashlyn, which appears to be over-saturated, reminiscent of flames. She finds Ashley\u0027s number and proceeds to dial.Back at the tanning salon, Ashley\u0027s slurpee has begun to leave a water residue, which leaks into the cooling unit and forces the temperature to rise slightly. As the girls seem to notice this, a cooling fan causes a coat rack to to fall over and knock over a plant, causing the plant to fall onto the shelf and collapse. The panel from the self slides right between the handles of both beds, locking Ashley and Ashlyn in as the temperature rapidly rises. Both girls wince and scream in agony as the bulbs begin overheating and eventually breaking, causing their skin to bubble, and soon a fire breaks out, setting both beds ablaze. The owner tries to get in, but the back door is locked, and he also locked the front. The girls are burned alive in the blazing tanning beds.The next scene is at Vancouer English Roman Catholic Cemetery funeral, where Ian begins questioning the preacher\u0027s comments about the equality of death and is led off by Lewis and Kevin. Afterward, Kevin finds Wendy kneeling at Jason\u0027s death grave (Age: 18, Born: Monday 23 February 1987, Died: Monday 30 May 2005, Status: Deceased), and she begins to show him pictures that depict what\u0027s going to happen beforehand, including a picture showing a plane\u0027s shadow about to crash into the World Trade Center in Manhattan, New York City. Suddenly, a strange wind blows over both of them, and Kevin tells Wendy he\u0027s going to get her some food.The two go to a local drive-thru restaurant, unaware that Frankie is ahead of them in his sports coupe. On the way, the two almost hit a truck in their vehicle, forcing the driver to jump aside. They get to the drive-thru of the restaurant, noticing a vehicle is pulling behind them and also to the side, blocking Wendy\u0027s exit. The sign also shows a the word \"control\" glitching out, and soon the radio kicks on, playing \"Turn Around, Look at Me\" by the Lettermen. Suddenly, Wendy and Kevin notice a driverless truck coming their way. They can\u0027t escape the vehicle, and they unknowingly honk at Frankie to move aside, only to have him flip them off. The couple behind them move their car, and they smash the windshield and jump out of the vehicle before the runaway truck hits it. The vehicles collide, forcing Kevin\u0027s car to eject its engine out of the front. It slides along the back of Frankie\u0027s car, and the fan cuts right into the back of his head, killing him. Wendy and Kevin go to check who the dead person was, and a \"jolt\" moment occurs when the fan spins one last time, splattering Frankie\u0027s brains all over the wall.After a talk with the coroner, Kevin and Wendy begin to calculate Death\u0027s design and who was sitting where on the roller coaster. They look over the photos and decide to pay Lewis a visit while he\u0027s in the middle of a workout. Lewis dismisses their claims and proceeds with his workout, even as Wendy points out to Kevin that his photo shows a Sultan caricature with swords, a weight dropping on his head, and a crying bear in the picture. (There\u0027s a tall bear statue and a sign with loose swords in the weight room). Lewis begins to work out with the other team members around him, causing the swords above his weight machine to rattle loose. Suddenly, one of Lewis\u0027 teammates accidentally jars a tooth out of the bear\u0027s mouth, forcing a weight lifter to drop his weights. Lewis stops for a moment, and the swords come down, missing him and instead cutting off a cable on the machine he\u0027s working on, unbeknownst to Wendy, Kevin and Lewis. Lewis takes this moment of apparent victory over Death and lifts the weights one more time, only to have the the two weights on top smash his head to bits.After a conversation about the bizarre occurrences, Wendy and Kevin make their way to a hardware store where Ian and Erin work. Ian is seen shooting at pigeons with a nail gun, then sets it down. He then makes light of the events that are occurring and makes fun with Wendy and Kevin. However, soon some accidents are set into motion and a forklift begins moving and knocking objects around, and it forces it to start lifting on a wall loaded with objects, including sharpened stakes and pieces of flat plywood. As Ian theorizes about Death\u0027s design, Wendy notices the stakes, and Kevin saves him as various items begin falling down. The plywood boards soon start stacking on top of each other, and a piece of wood flies off and penetrates a bag of sawdust, blinding Erin. She ends up falling backwards and lands with the back of her head against a nail gun, and nine rounds end up getting fired through her head and hand, killing her. Wendy, Kevin and Ian stare in horror.After a visit to the police station and the disbelief that follows, Wendy and Kevin split up, with Ian unnoticeably looking at Wendy from his truck. Wendy ends up falling asleep at her house, and Julie comes along to take the lucky bracelet back, for good luck. Upon leaving, Wendy wakes up and realizes that Julie and her friend Perry sneaked into the ride as well, upon identifying the bracelet in a photograph. She calls Kevin and informs him that his photo looks like something glaring, with bright lights. It\u0027s then that Kevin informs her that he\u0027s overlooking security at a colonial fair, complete with fireworks, and Wendy starts heading out the door to the fair. Soon, the song she heard at the drive-thru begins playing again, and she notices a vehicle following her. She almost hits a wolf in the middle of the road but continues to the fair.Kevin notices Julie and her friends Perry (Maggie Ma) and Amber (Ecstasia Sanders) at the fair and tries to talk to her, but she runs off after being annoyed by him. Meanwhile, an actor at the fair leaves his lighting stick in front of a cannon, knocking it sideways and forcing a cannonball to run along and knock one of the firework trailer cars off balance. Wendy shows up, suspecting Kevin might be struck by fireworks. As the show at the fair starts, and fireworks begin to go off, a couple of teenagers set off some firecrackers, startling a nearby horse. The horse begins running through the crowd, dragging a wooden stake behind him. Julie ends up getting the rope tied around her neck, and almost gets impaled on a rake that the horse jumps over. Kevin, however, manages to cut her loose. It\u0027s then that Wendy asks the frantic Julie who was sitting next to her on the roller coaster, and she glances at Perry. As Perry realizes this and begins standing up, the horse, still startled, pulls a flagpole off a trailer, which launches itself into Perry\u0027s back, killing her.After a close call with Kevin where he is nearly killed by a blazing gas leak, Julie and Wendy begin to drag him off, only to run into Ian, who thinks that he is the cause of Wendy\u0027s death (indicated by a shirt she was wearing, bearing his last name, which is also the name of their school). He confronts them as a firework cart begins wobbling and aims the fireworks right at them. The three duck as the fireworks go off, which entirely avoid Ian. Thinking he\u0027s safe and that Wendy is next, a loosened crane of a cherry picker that was struck by fireworks launches the McKinley sign downwards which cuts Ian in half. His corpse appears to be flipping off the three, and the screen fades to white.Five months later, on Monday 21 November 2005 as \"FIVE MONTHS LATER\", Wendy is shown to be in another town, starting a new life with her friends. She is on board of a subway train along with them, and starts to notice advertisements of the locations the previous deaths occurred at, as well as the \"Turn Around, Look at Me\" song being sung by a patron. She then gets uncomfortable and tries to exit the train, but is stopped by Julie, who also boards the train. As she does, a group of football fans drop an unfinished candy bar, which misses a trash can and falls onto the tracks, where a rat begins eating it As the doors close, Wendy can\u0027t help but notice that the train\u0027s number is \"081\", which, in the reflection of a mirror she is looking at, reads \"180\", the ominous number in the franchise. She is unnerved, but sits down to talk to Julie. As they speak, she notices Kevin riding on the train as well, and goes over to ask why he\u0027s there. As he begins talking, she notices something is wrong as the lights begin to dim. Meanwhile, the rat chews on the candy bar, but gets too close to electricity and fries itself, causing the tracks to switch over. The train then goes haywire, and everyone panics as it flies off the tracks. Julie is obliterated by the train\u0027s wheel, and Kevin is thrown against a cracked window and is unable to move as it slowly begins to grow weaker. The window finally breaks and Kevin is jettisoned outside, screaming as he is violently ground between the train and tunnel wall. Wendy clings onto a pole, screaming, until the train crashes and she is thrown outside. Wendy sees that everyone is dead around her, and she crawls, seeing her leg is severely injured. Wendy begins crying and soon afterwards another train approaches her at full speed. She begins screaming word voice tell \"No!\" and just as the train is about to hit her it is revealed to the be another premonition she had while talking to Kevin - but this time, the premonition has taken place mere seconds before the accident which it depicted word voice tell \"I was gonna look you up afterwards, but You OK Is somethin\u0027 wrong.\" Wendy alarms Kevin and Julie about the train as Kevin grabs the emergency brake along with Julie and Wendy try to pry the door open his Wendy as final last end closing word voice tell \"The train.

She suspects Owen was having an affair and is asked by Claire to stop digging into Owen\u0027s past. After a night out with Claire and their coworkers, a drunken Beth reveals that she died for four minutes in a car accident years ago and saw that there was nothing when she died. Owen always disagreed with this and was close to changing her mind before he died. Beth also states that she suffered from depression and that Owen began sleepwalking a year ago, expressing concern that she somehow passed her negative emotions to him. That night, Beth is awoken by a supernatural presence and witnesses several frightened women fleeing through the woods. Investigating, she finds blood on the boat where Owen shot himself and feels an invisible presence.Traversing across the lake to investigate a strange set of lights, Beth discovers a reversed, identical copy of her and Owen\u0027s house and sees ghostly figures of women with Owen.

And the light gave birth to Angels. And the earth gave birth to Man. And the fire gave birth to the Djinn, creatures condemned to dwell in the void between the worlds. One who wakes a Djinn shall be given three wishes. Upon the granting of the third, the unholy legions of the Djinn shall be freed to rule the earth. Fear one thing in all there is...fear the Djinn.   The next scene is set in Persia during the year 1127 A.D. with the Djinn asking a Persian emperor to make his second wish. The emperor asks the Djinn to show him wonders. The Djinn uses his powers to torture and mutilate people in the palace. Before the emperor can make his third wish, Zoroaster, a sorcerer (Ari Barak), interrupts and states that upon the third wish granted to the one who woke the Djinn, a gateway will open between the worlds and the evil race of Djinn can live on earth. The sorcerer then reveals a fire opal. The Djinn is sucked into the jewel, where he remains captured.In present day America Raymond Beaumont (Robert Englund) is supervising workers as they lower a box containing an antique statue of Ahura Mazda onto a ship\u0027s deck. The worker who is lowering the crate is drinking on the job and accidentally drops it from his crane, killing Beaumont\u0027s assistant (Ted Raimi) and destroying the statue. It breaks open and a dockworker finds the fire opal inside which he steals and pawns. The jewel ends up at Regal Auctioneers, where boss Nick Merritt (Chris Lemmon) gives it to appraiser Alexandra Amberson to examine. Her examinations of the jewel wake the Djinn.Thinking she saw something inside the jewel, Alexandra takes it to her labworker best friend and potential love interest, Josh Aickman (Tony Crane) to analyze. Later, as he is collecting data, light reflections cause the gem to explode and the Djinn is released. The lab is destroyed and Josh is killed, upon his wish for relief from his physical pain.Alex, thinking the gem has something to do with the explosion and subsequent death of Josh, tracks down Beaumont, to whom the statue belonged. Beaumont tells Alex to visit a folklore professor named Wendy Derleth (Jenny O\u0027Hara) to find out more about Ahura Mazda and the gem. He also invites Alex and her sister, Shannon (Wendy Benson) to a party he is hosting.The folklore professor tells Alex about the jewel, the Djinn, and its evil history. Later, Alex learns that the Djinn needs to power the gem with the soul of humans, and then grant her three wishes before he can unleash the Djinn on Earth. During this time, the Djinn, who had been in demonic form removes the face of a corpse in the morgue, taking on the dead man\u0027s form and the name Nathaniel Demerest. The Djinn, now as Nathaniel, goes about granting people wishes in return for their souls while he searches for Alex. He finally tracks down Alex\u0027s boss and grants him a greed-inflicted wish so that he can get Alex\u0027s address.Alex is haunted by visions whenever the Djinn grants a wish. She goes to Wendy\u0027s house to consult with her again, but Nathaniel has already killed her and taken her form. During their conversation, Alex realizes she is really talking to the Djinn. He confronts her and asks her to make three wishes. He even gives her a \"test\" wish. She uses this wish and orders the Djinn to kill itself. He complies by blowing his head off with a gun, yet the wound heals instantly; as the Djinn is immortal, he cannot be killed. Alex then uses the first of the \"official\" three wishes: Her first being to know her opponent, the Djinn. He teleports her to his terrifying world within the gem, thus demonstrating his true nature to her. Next, she wishes herself back to her apartment, alone. The Djinn had been threatening Alex\u0027s sister, so Alex sets about finding Shannon. She races to Beaumont\u0027s party and Nathaniel follows. While talking to Nathaniel at the party, Beaumont makes the mistake of wishing his party would be unforgettable, and Nathaniel begins wreaking havoc by causing the art pieces to kill the guests.The Djinn finally corners Alex and traps Shannon, trying to scare Alex into making the ultimate third wish. Alex wishes that the dockworker had not been drinking on the job two days ago undoing the events that followed (and presumably reviving the Djinn\u0027s victims back to life) and trapping the Djinn in the opal. The dock scene is shown again and the now sober operator has no trouble lowering the crate containing Ahura Mazda. Alex goes to see Josh at the lab. He notices that Alex is strangely pleased with herself, but she will not say why.Back on the statue of Ahura Mazda, which is now in Beaumont\u0027s private collection, the camera zooms inside the jewel and shows us the Djinn on a throne, waiting to be released.","Weighted Degree":"6.0","numvotes":"23000","productioncompany":"Image Organization","countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"5.8","originaltitle":"Wishmaster","size":"3","genres":"Fantasy,Horror","storyline":"In the beginning of the times, God created life into universe: light gave birth to angels, earth to men and fire to djin, creatures condemned to dwell in the void between the worlds.

From this priest Jericho gets the name Christine York (), a young woman living in New York.Jericho finds Christine and rescues her from a group of Catholic assassins. It turns out that Christine has been chosen to bear Satan\u0027s child on New Year\u0027s Eve, 1999, a date that is rapidly approaching. Jericho and Christine escape to a church where Father Kovak (Rod Steiger) knows what is going on. Christine stays with the faith-filled Christians while Jericho scoffs at their faith and leaves.Jericho is visited by Satan (), who wants the location of the girl. It turns out that Jericho had a wife and daughter, but they were murdered by gangsters to get revenge on Jericho, who was a cop. Satan mocks God and promises to bring Jericho\u0027s family back to life if Jericho helps. Jericho tells Satan to \"Go to hell,\" and throws him out of a window.Later, Satan tricks Jericho into leading him to Christine. Christine is taken by Satan and his followers, with Jericho beaten and left for dead. After waking, Jericho loads up on guns and ammo and interrupts Satan\u0027s impregnation ceremony. Jericho and Christine flee as Jericho pumps hundreds of rounds and grenades into Satan.The battle takes them to a church. Satan\u0027s assumed body has been destroyed, so he possesses Jericho. Satan (in Jericho\u0027s body) is about to rape Christine, but Jericho resists and kills himself. New Year\u0027s Eve passes, and Satan is defeated. Before dying, Jericho sees the ghost of his wife and daughter, thanking him for doing the right thing.********************************************************************************************************************In 1979, a newborn girl named Christine York is identified by Satanists including her physician, Dr. Abel, and her guardian, Mabel as the one chosen to bear Satan\u0027s son during the last hour on New Year\u0027s Eve, 1999, due to a symbol on her arm. As she is being born, a priest in the Vatican witnesses a comet arching over the moon, described as the \"Eye of God\", heralding the birth of the one chosen to be the mother of Satan\u0027s child. The priest is then sent on a mission by the Pope to find and protect the girl from Satan\u0027s presence at all costs. However, a few Vatican Knights (led by a corrupted cardinal) insist that she must be killed to prevent Satan\u0027s plans, which most of the clergy (including the Pope) opposes, as they view that taking a life in an attempt to stop evil is sinful.Twenty years later, near the end of 1999, retired cop Jericho Cane, in a constant state of depression since his wife and daughter were murdered by hit-men, works for an elite security and protection company. He and his co-worker/friend Bobby Chicago are assigned to protect a Wall Street banker. They are attacked by a priest named Thomas Aquinas, who is eventually captured and taken to a hospital. Unknown to Jericho, Aquinas somehow knew the real identity of the banker - he has been possessed by Satan and now wields great powers. Satan locates Aquinas and brutally murders him, crucifying him onto a ceiling. Jericho and Chicago see a name amongst many other things scratched into Aquinas\u0027s skin, and after some guesswork, begin searching for Christine York.Jericho and Chicago find the now-adult York in her apartment and save her from the Vatican Knights who attempt to assassinate her. That evening, Chicago waits in a van while Jericho discusses the recent happenings with Christine. Satan arrives and blows up the van, killing Chicago. As Jericho and Christine try to flee, they are apprehended by Mabel who is possessed with preternatural strength despite her late middle age and lesser size. Jericho barely manages to subdue her. Outside, Marge, Jericho\u0027s superior from his days in the police force, and another police officer, both Satanists, confront him, demanding Christine. Jericho kills them both. A few moments later Satan resurrects Marge for her usefulness as a NYPD detective to have the police search for Jericho and Christine, who have escaped to a nearby church, seeking answers from a priest, Father Kovak.Kovak soon realizes Christine and the banker\u0027s roles, and describes how at the end of every millennium, Satan will possess a man\u0027s body to consummate with the flesh of a preordained woman. If he succeeds in taking York, he will have free rein over the world. After hearing that the only way to defeat Satan is to \"have faith\", Jericho tries to persuade Christine to go into hiding with him, but she prefers to stay with Kovak after he says that Satan\u0027s greatest trick was to fool Mankind that he did not exist and she felt Kovak\u0027s explanation was true. Frustrated, Jericho returns to his apartment, and it is there that Satan meets with him and tries to tempt him with his lost family and his anger at God in order to make him reveal Christine\u0027s location. Jericho resists and manages to throw Satan out of his apartment window. Chicago soon shows up, alive and well. Despite Jericho\u0027s initial suspicion, they make a plan to retrieve Christine.At the church, where Kovak and his clergy inform the Pope of York\u0027s location, he orders them to hide and protect her at all costs. Unfortunately, the Vatican Knights arrive again, taking Kovak and his clergy into custody while they try to kill Christine again. Before they manage to do so, however, Jericho comes by and stops them, saving Christine and the clergy. Satan then appears, and Jericho runs away safely with Christine. The clergymen, in an act of bravery, confront Satan and try to send him back to Hell by using exorcism, but he resists them with impunity, killing the Vatican Knights, including the misguided cardinal. As Jericho and Christine arrive outside, Chicago then betrays the two; he leaves with Christine while Jericho is beaten by a mob of Satanists and left for dead. The next morning, Jericho is found and rescued by Kovak. Jericho immediately arms himself heavily to resume his search for Christine. He notices the resurrected Marge and follows her to Satan\u0027s hidden temple. There, he manages to rescue Christine and kill Marge for the second time. Chicago steps in to stop Jericho, revealing that Satan resurrected him in exchange for his help in capturing Christine. He manages to fight off Satan\u0027s influence after some persuasion by his friend; in retaliation, Satan burns him alive. Enraged, Jericho opens fire on Satan and escapes with Christine in the ensuing chaos.The two make their way through Satan\u0027s hideout and into a subway tunnel. They board a train and attempt to escape. Satan catches up with them and kills the motorman. In the ensuing fight, Jericho fires an M203 grenade launcher at Satan, wrecking the train and buying them enough time to escape. The banker\u0027s body is now irreparably damaged and so Satan leaves it to find a new host.Jericho and Christine escape to the streets and into another church where he prays to God. Satan smashes through the floor and confronts Jericho in his true form: a massive, demonic creature. He enters Jericho\u0027s body and possesses him. Now controlled by Satan, Jericho attempts to rape Christine, but with the help of her begging words, he is able to fight Satan\u0027s control for a few seconds. Using what may be his only opportunity to redeem himself, Jericho impales himself on the sword protruding from a fallen statue of Saint Michael The Archangel, thus disabling his body for the few remaining seconds before midnight. At the stroke of midnight beginning the year 2000, the will of God frees Jericho\u0027s body from Satan\u0027s control and sends Satan back to the depths of Hell forever. After being granted a vision of his wife and daughter smiling and waiting for him on the \"other side\" (Christine also sees them), Jericho dies contented. Christine thanks the deceased man for saving her life as New York celebrates the start of the new millennium.","Weighted Degree":"2.0","numvotes":"109612","productioncompany":"Beacon Communications","countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"5.8","originaltitle":"End of Days","size":"1","genres":"Action,Fantasy,Horror","storyline":"On December 28th, 1999, the citizens of New York City are getting ready for the turn of the millennium.

As part of the ritual they chop her hand off, take it outside and throw it to the jackals. They go back into tomb and place the lid on the sarcophagus. Outside, a jackal dies on the ground with its throat ripped and bloody as the hand crawls away. As the priests leave the tomb a sandstorm appears and they all die with lacerated throats too. The severed hand crawls away. Margaret awakes from her nightmare. Her father Professor Julian Fuchs (Andrew Weir) comes into bedroom to comfort her. Another man, Corbeck (James Villiers), watches then from the window of an empty house opposite.Next morning the Professor gives Margaret a ring containing a large ruby. She puts it on showing she has a scar completely across her wrist before going off with her boyfriend Tod (Mark Edwards) in his sports car, observed again from by Corbeck from opposite.In a mental hospital two orderlies look at Berrigan (George Coulouris) in his cell which has a desk and some furnishings. He is seeing some lights that look like stars on his carpet.Tod inspects Margaret\u0027s ring closely. He thinks it must have come from her father\u0027s expedition. Tod says he will take it to a friend who can give them more information.At the mental hospital, Corbeck visits Berrigan. He tries to take an ornamental cobra from the wardrobe but Berrigan attacks him and the orderlies intervene and make him leave.Tod and Margaret visit expert Geoffrey Dandridge (Hugh Burden) to show him the ring but when he sees Margaret he collapses. Star-like lights appear in the ring.Fortune teller Helen Dickerson (Rosalie Crutchley) is looking into her crystal ball to read a fortune for her customer but sees the same star-like lights too. She is alarmed and asks the customer to leave.Later, at the end of the day, Geoffrey sends his assistant home then goes to a cupboard and takes out and opens a box containing a jackal\u0027s skull. Corbeck arrives and Geoffrey explains that he has seen a woman with the ring. Corbeck explains to Geoffrey she is Margaret Fuchs, daughter of Professor Fuchs, and it will soon be her birthday and soon be time.That night Margaret dreams again about the soul of Queen Tera living all these years while her mortal body has waited. Her time is drawing near and it was she who guided people to her tomb to find her. In a flashback, explorers Professor Fuchs, Geoffrey, Corbeck, Berrigan and Helen Dickerson enter Queen Tera\u0027s tomb. Around the tomb are several ornaments around including one of a cobra snake, the skull of jackal, and a cat. They open the sarcophagus and see Queen Tera\u0027s body with the hand severed. The hand is on the floor next to the sarcophagus with the red ruby ring on a finger. The Professor takes the ring off and from its inscriptions identifies the queen as Tera. At the exact same time, Mrs Fuchs is in hospital giving birth to baby but she dies in the process. The baby at first appears to be stillborn but then doctors hear its heart start beating. The severed arm of Queen Tera in the sarcophagus starts bleeding fresh blood. Margaret wakes up from her dream and tells Tod she must leave immediately.In the basement of his house Professor Fuchs opens the sarcophagus and looks at Queen Tera\u0027s body. Margaret and Tod arrive, observed by Corbeck opposite, but there is an ominous feeling and sound from the basement. They break down the door to the basement and rush to the Professor who has cuts on his neck. He instructs them to call Doctor Putnum (Aubrey Morris). They put the Professor in bed but he is unresponsive. Doctor Putnum says the Professor will be like that for a few days and cannot reveal much about Professor\u0027s wishes other than his work would astound the world of science.That night Margaret goes to the basement and looks at Queen Tera\u0027s body. Corbeck arrives and explains the ruby is the symbol of the god to come. The Professor life\u0027s work was to discover the legend of the queen and find the truth, and he and Corbeck and their team searched for her tomb together. There was an attack on one of their members in tomb and fresh blood from Tera\u0027s wrist at exactly the same time Margaret was born in the image of Tera. Tod arrives and they agree Tera has some kind of astral power which will be directed against them if they don\u0027t understand it. They agree they must contact all old members of team to help reunite Tera with her soul.Tod and Margaret visit Berrigan at the mental hospital. When he sees Margaret he is frightened. Margaret realises he thinks she is Tera so she pretends to be Tera and asks for her familiar - her snake. He says he has not got it, then breaks down causing the orderlies to enter and restrain him and Tod and Margaret have to leave.Back home, Putnum is checking on the Professor. He is still unconscious and the doctor says there will be some paralysis on one side. He says the Professor wanted to protect her from the artefacts in the basement.Tod reads the Professor\u0027s journal. The simultaneous events of the Professor entering the tomb and Margaret\u0027s birth were a unity created by Tera. Tera had prepared for an abstract metaphysical state by lying in her sarcophagus, creating an astral body with freewill and a conscious intelligence. He believes this power could be used to keep people alive for a long time in suspended animation. Margaret says she feels Tera is dreaming of loneliness, of ancient land and times, when love was a divine possession.In the mental hospital that night the orderlies tease Berrigan with the cobra then leave it on the desk where he can see it when they leave. He struggles in his strait-jacket then goes still and listens. Suddenly the snake disappears from the desk and he sees its shadow approaching him. The window bursts open and wind blows everything around but he cannot escape. The snake approaches and strikes him. He dies with his cuts to his throat.The next morning the Professor wakes up. Margaret explains he had a terrible shock. She asks about the ring and why would it protect her. The Professor explains the priest severed it because they thought it was source of her evil. She says Berrigan is dead and the snake has appeared in their basement. She mentions Corbeck but the Professor implores her not to have anything to do with him. She asks where Tera\u0027s hand is but he cannot answer. Out of the window she sees Corbeck going into house opposite and she goes across to confront him. They argue over the facts but she says they need her and she is interested in the power that she may now have. Corbeck says Tera is beyond good and evil and they need to understand her. He says the relics from her tomb are needed for her resurrection from the dead, to provide power over life and death. He says her father is weak and cannot be a part of it. She says she will do anything to have the power so Corbeck says they will do it together.At Geoffrey\u0027s, his assistant tells him about Berrigan\u0027s death as she leaves at the end of the day. He realises that the jackal skull is significant and takes it out. Margaret arrives and says she wants the skull. He panics and tries to escape out of the window and down the fire escape but he drops the box. As he looks for it he hears a jackal call. He flees in fright.Tod arrives wondering what is going on. Margaret will not tell him anything and leaves. He looks around and hears the jackal call from outside. He investigates, going down the fire escape where he finds the empty box that housed the skull. Hearing noises then a scream he finds Geoffrey\u0027s body with the throat lacerated and bloody. He sees the shadow of a jackal running away.Margaret looks at Tera\u0027s body in the sarcophagus. The wrist is still bleeding fresh blood. Corbeck arrives and together they see that both the cobra and the jackal\u0027s skull are now present in the basement. Tod arrives and tries to stop Corbeck and Margaret. When they refuse he drives away to get help. Margaret screams wishing Tod dead. Tod crashes his car into a tree, his throat lacerated and covered in blood. She is frightened but Corbeck says she must not weaken and she is coming of age. Margaret collapses to the floor.The Professor staggers down to the basement and sees Margaret lying on the floor. Corbeck explains that Margaret no longer exists and soon Tera will be reborn and the Professor cannot do anything to stop it. Corbeck leaves to get the final artefact, the third and final phase of Tera\u0027s soul.Margaret dreams in bed watched by the Professor and Doctor Putnam. The Professor insists Putnum give her an injection to ensure she will not wake but while he is preparing it she wakes up. He tries to convince her to go back to bed but she uses her willpower to kill him. He dies with a lacerated throat like the others and Margaret flees. The Professor returns to find Putnum\u0027s body, then Corbeck arrives and helps the Professor move the body downstairs. Corbeck says they need each other and they control Tera not the other way around. Corbeck knows where Margaret has gone.Margaret arrives at Helen Dickerson\u0027s house. She is afraid and tries to strike Margaret but cannot do so. Instead she concedes and gives Margaret the statue of the cat. As Margaret leaves, she uses her willpower again to kill Helen. Corbeck arrives and sees Helen\u0027s body. Margaret reappears at the door and tells Corbeck to come.The Professor finds the scroll of life in the basement then sees that the statue of the cat has appeared. He looks at the severed hand in its box, then Margaret and Corbeck arrive. Corbeck takes the severed hand and places it back in the sarcophagus next to the wrist. The Professor implores him not to read the scroll saying Tera has abused her power and to wait, but Margaret says she is ready and where there is good there must be the opposite. Corbeck reads the scroll of life, to reunite Tera\u0027s soul and body and rekindle her astral spirit. The hand reattaches itself to the wrist. Margaret says to the Professor it was Tera that lead them to the tomb. The Professor realises Tera is in Margaret and Corbeck must not finish scroll. They stab Corbeck to death with some relics but Tera awakes. They try to kill her too but she kills the Professor first. Margaret manages to stab her but the building collapses in on top of them all.In a hospital, the medical staff have no idea who the woman all bandaged in the bed is. Her eyes open wide but cannot speak clearly from underneath all the bandages.","Weighted Degree":"2.0","numvotes":"3254","productioncompany":"EMI Films","countriesoforigin":"United Kingdom","averagerating":"5.7","originaltitle":"Blood from the Mummy\u0027s Tomb","size":"1","genres":"Horror Only","storyline":"On the night before her anniversary, Margaret Fuchs receives an ancient Egyptian ring with a red stone as a birthday gift from her father, Prof. Julian Fuchs.

The pillar is bought by the rich and spoiled J.P. Monroe (Kevin Bernhardt), owner of a popular nightclub called The Boiler Room. An ambitious young television reporter, Joey Summerskill (Terry Farrell), slowly begins to learn about Pinhead and the mysterious puzzle box. She is introduced to the pain the box can bring when she views a teenage club-goer being ripped apart by the box\u0027s chains in a hospital emergency room. She tracks the box and a young woman named Terri (Paula Marshall) to The Boiler Room, from which Terri had stolen the puzzle box.Through video tape interviews with Kirsty Cotton recovered from the Channard Institute, Joey and Terri learn about the demonic Cenobites and the power of the Lament Configuration, the only means of sending Pinhead back to Hell. Pinhead remains dormant until one night several hooked chains shoot out of the pillar and rip into one of the club goers, Brittany Virtue (Sharon Percival), Monroe had recently slept with. After killing her she is absorbed and her face appears on the pillar. Pinhead convinces Monroe to bring him club members so he can feed on their blood and be freed from the pillar.Now more dangerous than ever before, since he has been separated from his human self - a World War I British Army officer named Elliot Spencer who takes Joey on a walk round a trench filled with the corpses of what are presumably his men, explaining the nature of himself and Pinhead - and is simply the manifestation of Elliot\u0027s dark side and no longer under the control of Hell and purely out to cause chaos and destruction (in the previous movies the Cenobites were creatures of order, not chaos). Pinhead slaughters everybody in The Boiler Room, creating several new Cenobites in the process. Pinhead sets out to destroy the puzzle box so he need never return to Hell again. As time runs short, Joey must think of a plan to bring Pinhead and his newly-created Cenobites back to the realm of Pinhead\u0027s human self or else doom both herself and the mortal world to an eternity of pain and suffering.\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003dA young, rich club owner, JP Monroe, stops in an art dealer\u0027s shop. As he looks around he notices a large, plaster column with several relief sculptures on it, mostly of humans contorted in pain. Also on the column is a small sculpture of a puzzle box. The owner of the shop approaches him and sells the piece to JP, telling him to \"take pleasure in it.\"At a hospital emergency room, a young TV reporter, Joey Summerskill, is doing a piece on the abilities of the staff, however, the ER is strangely vacant that night. Suddenly, a man is wheeled inside the ER on a gurney. Sharp hooks at the ends of long, bloody chains are embedded in his flesh. As he passes Joey, the man whispers, \"Help me.\" A young woman follows after him, hysterically chattering about his condition. Joey interviews her briefly and the woman tells her that she \u0026 the man came from a club called The Boiler Room. When the doctors and nurses try to treat him, the chains are suddenly lifted by an unseen force, tearing at his flesh, and the man screams in pain. As the doctors and the young woman watch horrified, his head explodes. Before she leaves, the young lady retrieves a small puzzle box the man had been holding. She asks for the young woman\u0027s name and finds out it\u0027s Terri.Joey is ultimately bored with her job; she\u0027s only given puff pieces to report on. She also experiences nightmares about her father, who\u0027d died in the Vietnam War.She goes to the Boiler Room and asks about Terri, who turns out to be JP\u0027s former girlfriend. They tell her that she\u0027s out with JP at a restaurant. Joey finds JP there \u0026 gives him her card, asking to call if he sees Terri. JP tries to hit on her but she rebuffs him. Later, Joey wakes up from another nightmare and receives a phone call from Terri \u0026 invites Terri to her apartment. Terri shows Joey the puzzle box, which allows anyone who solves it to experience a strange realm of Hell. Terri concludes that the man who died in the ER must have stolen the puzzle box from the sculpture JP had recently bought.At the Boiler Room JP, a self-absorbed and cruel man, examines the sculpture he\u0027d bought. JP finds a hole in the column where the puzzle box had been. JP reaches into the hole and a rat bites him on the hand, drawing blood. JP\u0027s blood splatters across the column and is inexplicably absorbed into it. JP is fascinated. Later, while slyly watching the women who come to his club, he spots a lovely blond girl at the bar and has one of his employees give her a single rose, an invitation to meet with him privately. He lures the girl to his apartment, attached to the club, and has sex with her. As he does, the sculpture shows slight signs of animation. After he\u0027s finished with the woman, he harshly tells her to leave his apartment, having only wanted her for pleasure. Angry at being spurned, she begins to berate him for being such a cad when hooked chains emerge from the sculpture and snare her skin. She\u0027s forced to turn around and face the pillar. One of the faces, belonging to the Cenobite Pinhead, suddenly comes to life and hooks her forehead with another chain. Her skin is yanked from her body in a single jerk and as she screams, she\u0027s swallowed into the sculpture. JP is horrified but listens intently as Pinhead tells him he can grant JP all the pleasure, wealth and fame he seeks if he\u0027ll supply the statue with fresh blood and flesh. JP is unconvinced and shoots at Pinhead with a pistol; the shots are useless -- Pinhead spits the bullets out effortlessly. JP promises to bring what Pinhead asks for.Joey continues to be plagued by the nightmares about her father. She also continues her investigation into the young man who died in the ER and JP\u0027s club. Her efforts continue to be fruitless. She also receives news that she\u0027s been offered a job in another city -- since she and Terri had struck up a mild friendship, Terri is upset and leaves Joey\u0027s apartment after receiving a call from JP, who asks her to come back to him.At JP\u0027s apartment, JP tries to talk Terri into starting up their romance again. Terri is very reluctant but still starts to fall for JP\u0027s charms. As he talks to her, he walks her closer to the pillar, suddenly grabbing her and trying to force her even closer to it. Pinhead\u0027s face suddenly comes to life and growls and Terri retreats. When JP tries to grab her again, she hits him in the face with a set of brass knuckles. He falls on the floor unconscious. Just as Terri is about to leave the room, Pinhead stops her, demanding she give him JP\u0027s body. She pushes his limp body closer to the pillar and watches in horror as JP is hooked and yanked into the pillar. The sculpture explodes, tossing bits of flesh around and Pinhead emerges, free of his prison. Terri is too frightened to retreat.Joey has another nightmare about her father while he fights in a battle in Vietnam. This time, she\u0027s confronted by a young British man in an army uniform. He identifies himself as Captain Elliott Spencer, a World War II veteran, whom, after the war, had acquired the puzzle box in the Far East after the war and had discovered, while trying to solve it, that it was a doorway to an alternate world much like Hell, where wanderers can experience the extremes of pain and pleasure. Spencer had unlocked the doorway and had eventually become a demon of the netherworld, subjecting thousands of victims to extreme torture. He\u0027d also had several demon assistants who\u0027d themselves been victims of the puzzle box. Having been challenged previously by a young woman, Kirsty Cotton, who\u0027s own father had been a victim of her crooked uncle, Pinhead was banished and his accomplices were destroyed. Joey learns of the box\u0027s power by watching a videotaped interview with Kirsty taken from the Channard Institute, where she was held as a psychiatric patient.Spencer himself wants to regain his human form and asks Joey to help him. He wants her to, using the puzzle box, lure Pinhead into the spirit realm Spencer currently lives in so he can capture him and break his curse. Joey agrees.Back at the Boiler Room, Pinhead bursts into the club and begins to torture, mutilate and kill the club-goers. Joey sees a news report on the carnage and calls her cameraman, Doc, who tells her he\u0027ll meet her there. When Joey arrives, Pinhead has finished his rampage. Joey runs from the club, chased by Pinhead. In the streets, she sees an odd-looking man approaching her: Doc has been turned into a Cenobite with a camera embedded in his head where his right eye used to be. Escaping Doc and another Cenobite -- the DJ from JP\u0027s club, who makes use of compact discs as weapons -- she retreats into a church. A priest meets her and doesn\u0027t believe her fantastic story about \"demons.\" Pinhead suddenly bursts into the church, shattering its stained-glass windows and melting the priest\u0027s steel cross in his hand. Over the priest\u0027s loud protests, Pinhead tortures the priest, forcing him to eat entrails plucked from his chest.Joey taunts Pinhead with the box and flees the church. In a nearby construction site she meets two more Cenobites: the first is JP, who has two drilling devices thrust through his head. The other is Terri, who wields sharpened hook blades and has a cigarette jutting from her throat. They are about to torture her when Pinhead stops them, demanding Joey give up the box. The box activates and Joey is sent to Hell with the Cenobites. In the alternate dimension, Joey meets her father. He asks for the box to break the spell and reveals himself to be Pinhead in disguise. He prepares to torture and transform her into a Cenobite when Elliott Spencer appears and forcibly fuses himself with Pinhead. While Pinhead is distracted, Joey stabs him with the reconfigured box, destroying him and restoring Spencer\u0027s humanity. The box remains and Joey drops it into a foundation block of the construction site. She walks away, believing that the terror is over. The building is constructed; the lobby features an elaborate decor of the box itself.","Weighted Degree":"4.0","numvotes":"30082","productioncompany":"Fifth Avenue Entertainment","countriesoforigin":"United States, United Kingdom","averagerating":"5.5","originaltitle":"Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth","size":"2","genres":"Horror Only","storyline":"Pinhead is stuck in a block after the Big Confrontation in \"Hellbound,\" The block containing Pinhead and the puzzle cube is bought by a young playboy as sculpture.

Credits follow.A man on horseback approaches a prison in the mountains along a narrow pathway. A church bell chimes the hour as a man opens the gate for the rider. He is a priest (Alex Gallier). He is escorted by the Warder (Michael Mulcaster) to see Baron Victor Frankenstein (Peter Cushing). The warder explains that the prisoner is dangerous. The Baron wishes to see the priest because he thinks he can trust the man with his story. He starts his story, \"I suppose it was when I was a boy at school. I always had a brilliant intellect. When my mother died, I inherited the Frankenstein fortune.\"The Young Baron (Melvyn Hayes) is escorting his extended family out of his house after his mother died. His uncle (Raymond Ray) leads the family delegation. Aunt Sophie (Noel Hood) and her daughter, young Elizabeth (Sally Walsh) stay behind. Aunt Sophie wants reassurance her allowance will continue uninterrupted. After confirming the money will continue, Victor quickly escorts the two relatives out the door. As they are leaving, a dapper gentleman in a brown top hat arrives. Paul Krempe (Robert Urquhart) walks into the house and presents himself to the new, but very young, Baron. He had corresponded with the Baron for a tutor. Initially he thinks there must be some mistake or a joke, but Victor explains the tutoring is for himself and he is serious. The two hit it off immediately. After two years, \"I learned all he had to teach, but we went on together probing into the unknown, investigating, recording, searching, always searching until gradually the sweep of our research began to assume a single direction and to this aim we finally turned all our energies. It took us years of unrelenting work to discover what we were seeking.\" With chemical and electrical apparatus they were able to restore life to a dead puppy. Paul sees the possibilities of their discovery. He notes, \"If we could delay or prolong the period in which the body is apparently dead while the heart is alive wed have a living body with only the barest life-spark present. That what that would mean when it came to performing major surgery!\" Paul wants to write up their findings and present it at a medical conference within a month. Victor expresses his opposition because he wants to experiment further and does not want to share the secret, not yet at least. He proposes the next step. Rather than just restore life, he wants to create life from the beginning. He tells Paul, \"We must build up our own creature, and built it up from nothing. We must create a human beinga perfect human.\" Paul disagrees, \"What you\u0027re saying is nonsense, a revolt against nature. Such a thing could only end in evil.\" Victor persuades Paul to continue the work. He proposes to obtain a body, and knows a highwayman was hanged for his crimes and suggests they retrieve it. They take a horse and cart and cut down the body and return it to their lab. Paul notes that half the head has been eaten away. Victor quickly cuts the head off, explaining it is of no use. He dumps it into a vat of acid in the storage room next door. They remove the old clothes, wrap the body in bandages and place it in a large, glass tank. Now Paul voices his objection to the whole exercise, \"I don\u0027t think we should continue with this.\" Victor tells Paul he will be leaving for a while but does not explain where or why.Justine the maid (Valerie Gaunt) carries refreshments into the living room and asks Paul if the Baron has returned. She answers the door, expecting that Victor has returned. To her disappointment it is not the Baron but a woman who tells her she was expected and needs help with her luggage. Elizabeth (Hazel Court) is the Baron\u0027s cousin and we learn later his fiancée. She mistakes Paul for the Baron. Victor arrives home in an excited state calling for Paul. He is not surprised to see Elizabeth. He and Paul rush off to the lab upstairs leaving Elizabeth annoyed and confused.Victor unwraps something from a small black bag. He proudly displays two hands, cut off at the wrist. He explains they are Bardello\u0027s hands--the hands of the world\u0027s greatest sculptor. Paul voices his objection to exposing Elizabeth to the experiment. He tells Victor, \"While you were away, I decided I could not continue with this experiment.\" He tries to convince Victor to stop, but he is unsuccessful. Victor remains in the lab and will graft the new hands on by himself. Paul goes downstairs and tries to convince Elizabeth to leave. In this he is also unsuccessful, mainly because he will not explain the nature of the experiment or the danger. She explains she is to be Victor\u0027s wife.Outside the lab, Victor and Justine embrace and kiss. Victor is just toying with the maid. She believes she will be his wife, but Victor tells her that Elizabeth is to be his wife. The next morning Victor prepares to leave on another trip. Elizabeth talks to him about the household accounts and possibly assisting in other ways. Victor pays a visit to the Municipal Charnel House and buys a pair of human eyes. Victor takes them home to examine them when Paul asks to see him. He reiterates his refusal to help Victor with his work. Victor proudly shows Paul how far he has gone on his own. Paul turns away from the tank with revulsion and exclaims, \"It\u0027s horrible!\" Victor tells Paul that once a genius brain is obtained and installed the creature will take on a benevolent face. When asked where the brain will come from, Victor replies, \"I\u0027ll get it.\"Victor and Elizabeth are in the living room entertaining a visitor. Professor Bernstein (Paul Hardtmuth) accepted an invitation from the Baron for dinner and to spend the night. The professor tells Victor that discoveries can be mishandled. Paul enters the room and is introduced to the distinguished professor. Victor escorts the old man upstairs to his room. At the top of the stairs Victor shows him a painting, maneuvering the old man closer to the bannister, which gives way. Victor pushes the old man through and down to his death. Professor Bernstein is given a burial at the Baron\u0027s expense and in his family vault. Later that evening the Baron retrieves Bernstein\u0027s brain. He carefully places the jar in his bag and prepares to leave the vault. Paul arrives, expecting to find Victor and accuses him of murder. Paul intends to stop Victor from using the brain, and tells him so. They briefly struggle over the bag and the jar is broken.Paul calls on Elizabeth in her room and again begs her to leave. He explains he only stays to ensure her safety. In the lab, Victor is picking pieces of glass out of the brain, trying to salvage it. He puts the brain into the skull and prepares to revive his newly finished creature. He starts the chemical and electrical equipment as an electrical storm brews outside. Paul is upstairs in his room preparing for bed. As the tank empties, Victor goes to Paul\u0027s room and again asks for help. He admits, \"That apparatus was constructed for dual operation. You know that. I thought I could work it myself, but I can\u0027t.\" But Paul gleefully replies, \"I\u0027m delighted.\" A lightning bolt starts the electrical components and the body in the empty tank begins to breathe. Victor promises that after the experiment is completed he will dispose of the body. Paul reluctantly agrees to help. Victor returns to the lab and hears glass breaking. He unlocks the lab door and standing there is the creature. It pulls away the bandages covering its head to reveal a scarred and hideous face (Christopher Lee). One eye is blue, the other brown, and it stares at its creator with hate. It grabs Victor and chokes him. Only Paul\u0027s quick action saves Victor. He breaks a chair over the thing\u0027s head. The creature stumbles and falls to the floor. Paul demands the creature be destroyed as Victor straps it down to a table. Victor tells Paul he will operate on the brain the next morning and try to correct its homicidal tendencies. But the next morning the lab is a shambles and the window broken. The creature has broken free and escaped.Victor and Paul search the countryside for the creature. An old blind man (Fred Johnson) and his grandson (Claude Kingston) are out in the woods for a stroll. The old man sits and the grandson goes down to the lake shore to pick mushrooms. The creature encounters the old man. After a brief exchange he kills the old man. The grandson returns to where he left his grandfather. Victor and Paul find signs and follow it into the woods. They find it, and Paul shoots the creature through the eye. The creature falls and is pronounced dead. They bury it in place and return to the house.Paul goes to the lab and tells Victor he is leaving. With the creature dead, he no longer needs to stay and protect Elizabeth. But Paul doesn\u0027t know Victor dug his creation up and returned its lifeless body back to the lab. Victor stares at his creature hanging in the store room and promises, \"I\u0027ll give you life again.\" Victor is dressed and tells Justine she can serve dinner. Justine reminds Victor of his promise to marry her. Her trump card is the revelation she is pregnant with his child. He does not believe he is the father, but Justine informs the master that Elizabeth will believe her. She adds that she will go to the authorities regarding the experiment. He fires the maid and orders that she leave the next morning. That night Justine goes up to the lab to get the proof she will need for the authorities. Victor leaves the lab door unlocked and Justine enters for a look. She enters the storage room and finds the revived creature. When she tries to flee, Victor locks her in, knowing his homicidal creation will kill her. It does.A week later, Victor and Elizabeth are having breakfast. Elizabeth inquires about Justine. Victor lies and tells her, \"I expect some village lothario eloped with her.\" They discuss the wedding plans. Elizabeth reveals she invited Paul. Instead of being angry, Victor casually informs her he hopes Paul comes. He says that he has something to show Paul.It is the eve of the wedding, and a reception at the Baron\u0027s home is underway. The Burgomaster (Andrew Leigh) is enjoying the laced punch and practicing his speech. His wife (Ann Blake) reproaches her drunk husband and they leave for home. When all the guests have left, Victor announces he will be working in the lab. Elizabeth is disappointed and tells her future husband. Paul does not attend the reception, but does come later that evening. Elizabeth tells Paul to go surprise Victor. Victor is preparing a plate of flood when Paul knocks on the lab door. Victor invites his old tutor into the lab. He leads him to the storage room. Paul is shocked to discover the creature chained to the wall and showing signs of brain surgery. Victor orders the creature onto its feet. It struggles but stands, then sits when ordered. Paul chides the Baron about the creature\u0027s lack of perfection, but Victor reminds Paul, \"There you see the result of your handiwork as much as mine...but you damaged it. You put a bullet in the wretched thing. This is your fault, Paul.\" Paul exits the lab, promising to go to the authorities and have them destroy the creature. Victor chases after him. He leaves the lab door unlocked and Elizabeth enters the lab. The creature breaks its chains. Elizabeth enters the storage room and sees the vat of acid. The creature gets out onto the roof. Victor and Paul see it and Paul goes to the village for help. Elizabeth goes outside to explore a noise she heard. Victor grabs a pistol and goes out to the roof. Firing at the creature he hits Elizabeth, then the creature. Only wounded, the creature approaches Victor. A well-aimed toss of an oil lamp sets the creature ablaze. The creature falls through the skylight and straight into the acid filled vat below.We return to the prison, and the priest still listening to the story now finished.

It is Hans\u0027 intention to collect information about the Mill of the Stone   Women, as it is known to the locals, and about the current owner,   professor and sculptor Gregorius Wahl [Robert Boehme], whose great grandfather created the   windmill and its eerie stone sculptures one hundred years ago. While   waiting for the housekeeper to summon the professor, Hans notices a   beautiful but sad-faced woman looking at him from behind a curtain. Before   he can say or do anything, he is directed by the housekeeper to wait in   the Professor\u0027s study. The housekeeper locks Hans in the study, but he   cannot miss the wails coming from behind the curtains. Alone in the study,   Hans has a chance to see the many stone sculptures in various stages of   preparation. He also comes upon a drawing of the young woman he just saw   behind the curtain. It is signed \"Elfi, 1912.\"Suddenly, a grinding sound in the next room attracts Hans\u0027 attention.   Curtains open to reveal a moving carousel featuring a diorama of women   from history. A sculpture of Joan of Arc tied to a stake passes by,   followed by Cleopatra holding an asp. Just as suddenly as it began, the   carousel stops as the professor enters the room. He seems a bit taken   aback that Hans has arrived earlier than expected but gives him a pile of   documents and a room on the second floor where he can work in peace. He   also warns Hans that he must complete his studies in six days.The next day, while Hans works hard on his research, his friends   Liselotte [Dany Carrel] and Raab [Marco Guglielmi], both students at the Academy of Fine Arts where Wahl   teaches drawing and sculpture, are discussing how Hans showing up is   causing Liselotte to feel distracted, as she and Hans were childhood   friends. Raab is distracted himself...by the girl posing as today\u0027s model.   Unfortunately, Annelore [Liana Orfei] has just taken a job as a singer in Paris, so   there is no hope for Raab. Later that evening, Hans meets Raab and   Liselotte at a nearby tavern. Liselotte is hoping to rekindle something   with Hans, until Hans asks Raab about the professor\u0027s daughter, Elfi.   Liselotte can see the interest in Hans\u0027 eyes and walks away.The next day, Elfi [Scilla Gabel] comes to see Hans. She begs him to help her and   gives him a key to her bedroom with instructions to meet her there at 11   PM. At 10:30, Elfi calls it a day and goes up to bed. She is accompanied   by her doctor, Loren Bolem [Wolfgang Preiss], who compliments her on her passionate   piano-playing and wishes she felt such passion for him, but Elfi wants   nothing to do with the doctor, even when he reminds her that he\u0027s the only   one who knows her secret. At 11, Hans enters Elfi\u0027s bedroom as planned,   only to find her sleeping soundly, almost as though in death. When he   arouses her, Elfi confesses that she was dreaming of him, and she offers   herself to Hans right then and there. Hans doesn\u0027t resist.On Sunday, there is a scheduled public showing of the carousel. As   the villagers arrive, Hans is informed that he has two visitors, too. It   is Raab and Liselotte. While Raab watches the performance, Hans and   Liselotte hang back in order to express their love for each other.   Unbeknown to Hans, Elfi is standing on the balcony and overhears   everything. Elfi leaves a note on Hans\u0027 desk that says \"I must see you   tonight without fail. No one will be here. You must explain everything,   otherwise...\" When Liselotte faints at the sight of the macabre carousel,   Raab takes her home. The professor calls Hans to his office and tries to   warn him about his daughter\u0027s delicate medical condition. She must not be   subjected to any strong emotions or her life could be in danger. The   warning is pretty clear...Hans is not to mess with Elfi.That night, Hans meets Elfi as she requested. Elfi swears her love   for Hans but is devastated when he tells her that he doesn\u0027t love her and   that their night together was a mistake. She begs him to take her away   with him, but Hans refuses. Elfi grabs a knife and threatens to kill him,   but Hans turns away and heads for the door. Suddenly, Elfi gasps for a   breath and falls to the floor. Not knowing what to do, Hans carries Elfi   to her bedroom and lays her atop her bed. Hans notices a mirror on her bed   and holds it in front of her face. When he sees no condensation on the   mirror, he backs away in horror. Elfi is dead! Hans runs away.Some days later, Hans returns to the mill to confess all to the   professor. Wahl is extremely angry and holds Hans responsible for Elfi\u0027s   murder. He informs Hans that Elfi has already been buried in the Veeze   cemetery, but Hans is confused when he finds a fresh rose on his desk. Who   could have put it there if Elfi is dead? Seeing the state that Hans is in,   Dr Bolem gives him two tranquilizers that cause Hans to pass out. He   awakens to a dream (or hallucination?) of Elfi rising from her bed. He   hears the piano playing, but the door into the parlor is locked. He roams   the mill, sees Elfi laid out in her coffin, hears screams and sees a girl   tied to a chair. Hans is finally confronted by Dr Bolem and Professor   Wahl, who cannot understand what Hans is going on about. Suddenly, Elfi   comes down the stairs, having been awaken by all the shouting. Hans is   speechless, and Wahl arranges for him to be taken by carriage back to town.Now the truth comes out. Bolem and Wahl are trying to confuse Hans,   to make him believe he\u0027s had an episode of madness. Unfortunately, all the   excitement causes Elfi to have another attack. While the doctor prepares   Elfi, the professor fetches the tied up girl (Annelore). The \"treatment\"   involves drawing off all of Elfi\u0027s \"bad blood\" and replacing it with blood   from Annelore along with a special serum developed by Bolem. As Elfi   revives, Annelore dies. Meanwhile, Hans is being taken care of by Raab and   Liselotte. His doctor believes Hans has suffered a nervous breakdown. Hans   is already feeling better and tells Liselotte that he\u0027s going to go to   Danzen, their home town, in order to ask Liselotte\u0027s parents for   permission to marry her.Back at the mill, Wahl is mummifying Annelore\u0027s body in preparation   for creating another statue for his macabre carousel. Bolem is performing   some tests on a sample of blood taken from Liselotte on the day she   fainted at the mill. Liselotte\u0027s blood type proves to be an exact match to   Elfi\u0027s, he tells Wahl, and transfusing Liselotte\u0027s blood into Elfi will   result in a total cure for Elfi\u0027s condition. Wahl can\u0027t wait and readies   the laboratory so that the transfusion can be performed as soon as   possible.When Hans returns from Danzen, he learns from the landlord that   Liselotte has been missing for the past 24 hours. In her room, Hans finds   her purse with her money and papers still in it. On her dresser, he sees a   photo of Liselotte with Annelore and recognizes Annelore as the girl he   saw tied to a chair at the mill. It wasn\u0027t a dream. It wasn\u0027t an   hallucination. It really happened. Looking for proof before going back to   the mill, Hans and Raab visit Elfi\u0027s grave and find it empty. Near the   tomb is a wax dummy of Elfi. Now certain that Hans wasn\u0027t dreaming,   hallucinating, or nuts, they break into the mill.The transfusion is underway in the basement laboratory. Liselotte is   ready, and they only have to anesthetize Elfi. A storm is brewing, and the   strong winds set the arms of the windmill turning. A new sculpture has   been added to the carousel, but the head falls off as the figure passes   before Hans and Raab. Raab picks up the head and recognizes it as the   mummified head of Annelore. Suddenly, a scream pierces the air. As Raab   and Hans struggle to get into the basement, Bolem confronts Wahl with a   request for Elfi\u0027s hand in marriage, but Wahl refuses.Knowing that this will be the last time Elfi will need to be   transfused and that Bolem\u0027s services are no longer needed, Wahl stabs   Bolem in the stomach and gets ready to conduct the transfusion himself. He   first removes Elfi\u0027s \"bad blood.\" When he looks for the serum to transfuse   into Elfi along with Liselotte\u0027s blood, he cannot find it. He finally   thinks to look in Bolem\u0027s pocket, where he finds the syringe...broken in   Bolem\u0027s fall to the floor. With Elfi drained of blood and no hope of   reviving her, Wahl sets the lab burning, grabs Elfi\u0027s body, and rushes   upstairs just as Hans and Raab break down the door into the lab. They   untie Liselotte and carry her from the burning room. As the fire spreads   through the mill, the carousel turns.

The truck\u0027s back shutter opens to reveal a sinister figure (Tom Savini) who drops off a package onto the sidewalk: the latest issue of Creepshow, much to Billy\u0027s delight. As the package opens of its own accord, Billy begins to read and the delivery man reveals his true identity as the Creepshow Creep.\"Old Chief Wooden Head\"An elderly couple, named Ray and Martha Spruce (George Kennedy and Dorothy Lamour), living in a small Arizona silver mining town, oversee a general goods store with a cigar store Indian named \"Old Chief Wooden Head\" who adorns the front porch and are humbled to see their old, run-down town coming to a bitter end.The Spruces are then visited by a Native American elder named Benjamin Whitemoon (Frank Salsedo) from a local tribe who gives them turquoise jewellery, which are his tribe\u0027s sacred treasures, as collateral for the debt the tribe has incurred. The elder bids them farewell and returns to his tribe.When Spruces go back inside their store, the couple are then subject to a vicious robbery led by Benjamin\u0027s nephew, Sam (armed with a shotgun) and his two friends. After ransacking the store, Sam demands that Ray hand over the turquoise. Ray resists, and as a result, the Spruces are then shot and killed by Sam. The three thugs then leave in their car and begin preparations to run away to Hollywood, California. Old Chief Wooden Head then comes to life and goes out on a warpath to kill Sam and his friends and avenge the murdered Spruces.Old Chief Wooden Head brutally kills Sam\u0027s two friends. He attacks the first thug by shooting arrows through the first thug\u0027s trailer, killing him. The wooden Indian then kills the second one by hacking him apart in his garage. Then, the wooden Indian then corners Sam in his trailer. Sam, confronted by the living walking Indian, sees that he is unable to fight back as the shells from his shotgun have no effect on his wooden assailant. Sam attempts to lock himself in his bathroom but Old Chief Wooden Head breaks through the wall and scalps Sam alive as he screams in terror.The next morning, Benjamin Whitemoon wakes up in the morning he finds the bag containing the turquoise jewellery by his side. He visits the Spruce\u0027s general store to find Old Chief Wooden Head back on his pedestal, holding his nephew\u0027s scalp. Now aware of what has happened, Benjamin wishes the dead Spruces a peaceful afterlife as well as peace for Old Chief Wooden Head now that his revenge quest has been completed. Whitemoon then drives away.Animated Interlude #1Billy is seen at the town post office, receiving a package from when he sent a product ad from his copy of the Creepshow magazine. Incensed by the skeptical clerk\u0027s dismissal of paying $9.99 for a toy from the \"funny papers,\" Billy reveals that the package actually contains the bulb for a carnivorous Venus Flytrap. The clerk doubts the actuality of the package and Billy sets off for home.\"The Raft\"Four college students, Deke, Laverne, Randy, and Rachel decide to go swimming in a desolate lake far away from civilization. As they make their way to a wooden raft in the middle of the lake, they realize that they are being terrorized by floating black blob when it grabs a hold of Rachel and consumes her.The frightened students begin to panic and mourn the loss of Rachel. Deke then contemplates quickly swimming to shore so he can bring back help as he is a fast swimmer. But before he can carry out his plan, the blob seeps through the raft\u0027s cracks and pulls Deke through the raft, killing him in the process. Randy and Laverne manage to evade the creature long enough to where it gives up trying to grab them from under the raft as well.Randy and Laverne spend the entire night on the raft, afraid to fall asleep in fear that the creature will attack them while they sleep. They do manage to fall asleep and Randy is the first to wake up in the morning, relieved to find that Laverne and himself made it through the night. With Laverne still sleeping, he begins caressing her body and fondling her breasts. She soon awakes screaming in agony as the creature has seeped through the cracks and has a hold of her face, much to Randy\u0027s horror.As the oil-like blob pulls her off the raft and begins consuming her, Randy uses the opportunity to jump off the raft and swim to shore. He ultimately makes it, barely escaping the creature and yells \"I beat you!\" However, the oil creature rises up from the water like a wave and engulfs Randy.The oil blob returns to the lake, with no evidence of the four students even visiting the lake other than their car which was left running the whole time. The camera pans out to reveal a \"No Swimming\" sign barely visible from behind some growth.Animated Interlude #2On his way back home from the post office, Billy is ambushed by a gang of neighborhood bullies, who harass him and take his package from him. The gang\u0027s leader then opens the package, finding the Venus Flytrap bulb, and throws it on the ground, crushing it with his foot. In retaliation, Billy kicks the bully in the groin and flees, with the bully and his gang in hot pursuit.\"The Hitchhiker\"An adulterous businesswoman named Annie Lansing (Lois Chiles) gets up from bed after sleeping with her extramarital lover (who is a gigolo), realizing that she has to get home before her wealthy attorney husband to avoid suspicion. Annie hops into her Mercedes-Benz and makes way for home several miles away.On the way, she accidentally kills an innocent hitchhiker (Tom Wright) as a result of her speeding down the dark road, eager to beat her husband to the house. Seeing that no one witnessed the incident, Annie takes off without much thought. Shortly after Annie takes off, the area of the incident is crowded by passersby, with many reporting the hit-and-run to the police.Miles away from the scene, Annie stops along the road and begins thinking about what she has done and the consequences involved, but she ultimately concludes that no one has anything on her and thinks everything will be fine. Before she can continue, however, the hitchhiker she killed suddenly appears outside her window and utters \"Thanks for the ride, lady.\" (A line repeated by the hitchhiker throughout the story).The frightened Annie then speeds off in terror, but everywhere she goes, the hitchhiker always reappears and becomes her tormentor throughout the trip as she repeatedly runs him over, hurls off the top of her car, slams his body into trees, etc. as he only gets more and more battered and bloody without dying. Annie eventually loses control of her car in which she drives off the road and down a hill and into a tree, knocking herself out.She awakes a short while later, not seeing the hitchhiker anywhere in sight, believing it to be a bad dream. She gets back on the road and drives home, succeeding in getting there before her husband. As she begins to step out of her car, the hitchhiker appears from under her car, completely mangled from the trip, still uttering \"Thanks for the ride, lady,\" as he was made or programed to do by the forces of Hell. The hitchhiker begins attacking her as she vainly attempts to fight him off.Later, Annie\u0027s husband finally arrives home to find his wife\u0027s dead body in her car, dead from carbon monoxide poisoning caused from the still running car, with the hitchhiker\u0027s sign lying beside her showing his targeted destination (reading: DOVER).EpilogueStill being chased by the bullies, Billy leads his pursuers into a vacant lot swarming with out of control plant growth. As he rides into what seems to be a dead end, the bullies move in to pummel him only to learn that the bulb they smashed was not the first one Billy had ordered, as a quintet of Giant Flytraps emerge from the surrounding weeds and devour the thugs one by one. The spectacle is witnessed by the Creep himself, who cackles in glee as he drives off in his delivery truck to deliver the latest issue of Creepshow to another town.","Weighted Degree":"9.0","numvotes":"24946","productioncompany":"New World Pictures","countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"6.0","originaltitle":"Creepshow 2","size":"3","genres":"Fantasy,Horror","storyline":"\"Creepshow 2\" is divided into three stories, conducted by a leading segment where a boy that loves the horror comic book Creepshow buys seeds of carnivorous plant and is bullied by four teenagers.

The opening scene shows a native girl, Zuranda (Jean Davis) participating in a ritual and placed on a table. A voodoo doll is placed on her chest. A chicken is waved over her and placed on her stomach and killed. Participating in the ritual is Dr. Roland Gerard (Tom Conway). He draws a sample of her blood.In the doctor\u0027s hut, Bobo, the houseboy (Otis Greene) enters and opens the blinds. He startles Susan Gerard (Mary Ellen Kay), the doctor\u0027s wife. Susan tries to bribe Bobo to help her escape her husband, but he fears the doctor\u0027s wrath. The hut is like a prison with bars on all the windows. Outside sits a guard, Gander (Emmett E. Smith). When Susan gets too close to the bars she gets a little too close to Gander\u0027s spear and she retreats inside. The ritual continues with Dr. Gerard and Chaka, the Witch Doctor (Martin Wilkins).In a bar, Rick Brady (Lance Fuller) and Marilyn Blanchard (Marla English) wait to approach a potential business partner. The bartender, Marcel Chateau (Paul Dubov) assists them in their scheme. Marilyn cozies up to Harry West (Norman Willis) at his table. They know and dislike each other, but they agree to a business venture. Marilyn tells Harry she intends to marry Rick. Rick and Marilyn leave the table after exchanging a few more barbs with Harry. They walk back to the bar and annoy Marcel and have a drink. She tells Marcel she\u0027s going to Harry\u0027s room and to distract their \"business partner.\" Marcel tells Yvette, the singer (Giselle DArc) to keep Harry occupied with a song. Marcel helps himself to his own product. Rick and Marilyn rifle Harry\u0027s room. They are looking for a map of the location of a tribe that has enormous amounts of gold and jewels. Harry notices his \"business partners\" have left. For $5 Marcel sells Harry a gun. Harry is unaware his weapon doesn\u0027t work, but Marilyn does. Harry returns to his room to find Rick and Marilyn examining a gold statue studded with diamonds and rubies. Harry\u0027s gun malfunctions, but Marilyn\u0027s works fine and she uses it to kill Harry. They continue to search Harry\u0027s room. It seems Harry had made arrangements before his untimely death to secure the services of a guide to find the tribe and collect the gold and jewels. That much Rick and Marilyn know.At the ritual, the girl\u0027s feet change. She changes into some kind of blond hairy creature, but we don\u0027t get a very good look. The witch doctor tells Dr. Gerard the change is only temporary. Zuranda is the daughter of the priest in the next village, so the tribe is responsible for her safety. Gerard wants to take Zuranda with him, but Chaka objects. Gerard finally convinces Chaka to let her leave, but just about that time Zuranda changes back to a native girl. Gerard wants the change to be permanent.Marcel comes to Harry\u0027s room to tell Rick and Marilyn that Harry\u0027s funeral is over. For a percentage Marcel arranges such things. He informs Rick and Marilyn there is a considerable fee due and payable. They are waiting for the guide, and since it was arranged by mail, Rick will impersonate Harry. The guide, Ted Bronson (Mike Connors, credited at Touch Connors) arrives at the bar and meets Marilyn. He is suspicious of her motives, but he needs the money.The next day they plan their trip. The three start their trek through the jungle complete with bearers. They decide to make camp just outside the voodoo territory. Gerard has returned to his lab with Zuranda. She screams which upsets his wife back in the hut. Susan enters the lab, against standing orders. Before he can send Susan back to her room, he informs his wife, \"I\u0027m using her to create a new being, not man, not beast, but a combination of the best of each. When I\u0027m finished we\u0027ll take her back to the States with us. We\u0027ll shatter the very foundations of Science.\" Susans reply is terse, \"You\u0027re insane.\" Gerard reminds her if she tries to escape he\u0027ll kill her. Zuranda again transforms. She has claws like a panther. The creature (Paul Blaisdell) is directed telepathically to go to the village. It destroys a hut and chases the couple with the baby inside off into the jungle. But Zuranda has serious qualms about harming anyone, and transforms back into her human form.Resting in the camp, Marilyn asks Ted about voodoo. Marilyn is drawn to the drums and tells Ted she\u0027s going to the north country. Ted informs her it will be without him. The next day Gerard approaches the village and is stopped by the natives until Chaka intervenes. Chaka confronts Gerard with the evidence he made Zuranda attack her own village. Chaka wants her back and Gerard agrees. He is told she will never kill because it is not in her nature to do so. Gerard departs. Ted and Rick get into a fight over Rick\u0027s trying to shoot a native scout. Ted is victorious and takes Rick\u0027s rifle. But the native village now knows of the white man\u0027s presence. Gerard takes his wife down to the lab to see Zuranda. Susan thinks she\u0027s dead. But Gerard explains that she is between life and death--a state of pre-transformation. Gerard smears blood on a doll and then tells Zuranda to get up and walk around the room. Zuranda complies. He injects her with a substance that turns her skin into armor plating. Gerard fires a gun at Zuranda and the bullets bounce off. Even acid has no effect when poured on her leg. Susan accuses her husband of being crazy and gets a slap across the face for it.Ted confesses to Marilyn that he thought she was poison the minute they met, but took the job because he needed the money. He asks for a straight answer, what are they looking for? She makes him a bargain--a 50/50 deal. She wants gold and badly. He agrees to take her as far as Bandaleya. She pulls a gun on Ted and takes his gun. She informs Ted he\u0027s going with her and Rick.When Bobo tries to take a message from Susan to the party approaching he is killed by Gander. When Ted tries to escape, Marilyn ties him up. Rick leaves looking for the village. Gerard is looking for Ted, Rick, and Marilyn. He has Zuranda with him in her transformed state. Gerard finds the camp and directs Zuranda to kill, but she is unable and retreats and transforms back into human form. Gerard admits that Chaka was right, he can\u0027t make her kill. He sends her back to her village. Rick finds the markings on the native totem pole which confirms they have the correct village. Ricks accosts Zuranda. She screams and bites Rick. He hits her and kills her. He walks back to camp and wakes Marilyn. He tells her they\u0027ve found the village. Gerard and Chaka find Zuranda\u0027s body. Chaka informs Gerard, \"White man die for this.\" Gerard agrees, until Chaka informs him that all white men, \"You too.\" They go to the camp and capture Rick, Ted, and Marilyn. They want the one who killed Zuranda. Marilyn rats out Rick. The bite on his hand is the evidence. Chaka insists Rick be executed by a white man, so Marilyn shoots Rick twice killing him. Dr. Gerard cuts Ted loose and they agree to stay with Gerard for a few days until things calm down with the villagers. Of course, Gerard has plans. Marilyn tells Gerard, \"It\u0027s lucky meeting up with you. I\u0027ve got a hunch I can use you in my business.\" Smirking uncontrollably, Gerard slyly replies, \"I\u0027m almost positive that I can use you in mine.\" They go back to Gerard\u0027s hut. Gerard takes Marilyn on a tour of the lab. He surmises, correctly, that gold is Marilyn\u0027s real interest in the village. He tells her he will arrange to make her a priestess. \"Then you can have anything you\u0027d like.\" Susan is locked in her room, but she has a rifle. She leaves her room and Ted notices her. They talk and she returns to her room. Gander keeps Ted inside the hut.At the village, they prepare for another ritual. Gerard and Marilyn arrive. Gerard convinces Chaka to use Marilyn for the ritual. They return the next day, and Marilyn is dressed in native garb for the ritual. Gander falls asleep and Ted goes to the lab. He checks around then leaves to get Susan in her room. Gander wakes and goes outside. He hears Susan and Ted talking. He captures Ted. Chaka and Gerard work on Marilyn. She transforms into the monster. Chaka pulls a ritual knife on Gerard so he takes Marilyn back to his hut after she transforms back into human form. Gerard takes Gander away from guarding Ted for a little task. Unguarded, Ted goes to see Susan. He grabs a knife and departs. In the lab, Gerard preps Marilyn for her new role as his monster/slave. Ted bolts the hut with Gander in hot pursuit. Just before Susan can escape, Gerard arrives with his monster. Susan shoots it with no effect. The monster picks Susan up and takes her in the direction of the village. Ted manages to kill Gander. Gerard escorts his wife the final distance to Chaka as the white sacrifice Chaka demands.Ted finds traces of Susan at the hut and hears Susan\u0027s screams at the village. He is captured by natives and brought to the village to be added to the sacrifice pile. Susan and Ted are tied up by next to a volcanic steam vent. Gerard calls his monster to come get her gold. Gerard is led away to be tied up with Ted and Susan. Ted and Susan manage to slip their ropes and get away as the monster attacks the village. Gerard orders the monster to kill Chaka--He is thrown into the pit. The monster discovers that all the ritual vessels are made of clay, not gold. Gerard informs the monster that the only gold item was the idol that went into the pit with Chaka. The monster feels betrayed and chokes Gerard. The monster returns to human form, now Marilyn. She sees the golden idol near the pit and approaches it. She bends down to retrieve it and falls into the pit, screaming. Ted and Susan return to the lab and mix up a couple of molotov cocktails. They use them to scare the natives and escape.At the bar, Marcel and Yvette are rolling a drunk for his wallet. Yvette gets her cut. Ted and Susan arrive just in time for the bus to town. Marcel asks about Marilyn and Rick and is told they are dead. Marcel comments, \"Her friend perhaps is dead, but not Marilyn. I have a feeling that one still lives.\" We close at the pit/steam vent as the creature crawls out.","Weighted Degree":"2.0","numvotes":"557","productioncompany":"Carmel Productions","countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"4.0","originaltitle":"Voodoo Woman","size":"1","genres":"Horror,Sci-Fi","storyline":"Deep in the jungles a mad scientist is using the natives\u0027 voodoo for his experiments to create an indestructible being to serve his will.

Margaret is writhing on the bed in agony thinking she has been afflicted with a cancer, and begs for God\u0027s mercy as she is taken. Her body contorts a few times as she screams and she looks up waiting to die. But she doesn\u0027t. She realizes she is still alive and there is something underneath her nightdress.

She puts the scissors down and cradles her newborn daughter.Cut to present day. Carrie White (Chloe Grace Moretz), now age 17 or 18, is a meek, shy young girl at her high school located in the small town of Castle Rock, Maine. Considered an outcast by everyone, she sneaks into the background hoping she will not be noticed. During P.E. class, during the gym game of water volleyball, the ball lands in front of her and she is asked to serve the ball. She accidentally hits Sue Snell (Gabriella Wilde) in the head which makes everyone, including Carrie, laugh. Sue\u0027s friend, Chris Hargensen (Portia Doubleday) tells Carrie, \"you eat shit\", so everyone starts laughing at her instead.After gym, Carrie starts to take a shower alone when she notices blood. She races to the girls for help, not understanding what is going on. The girls, led by Chris, realize Carrie is having her first period and doesn\u0027t understand it. Instead of helping, they throw tampons at her and chant: \"plug it up.\" Chris even films it on her iPhone. Even Sue joins in with the chanting and taunting, but stops halfway through, ashamed of what she is doing. The gym teacher, Ms. Desjardin (Judy Greer) overhears them and in an effort to calm her down, slaps Carrie to keep her from screaming. Ms. Desjardin yells for everyone to get out. As the girls file out, a light shatters. Sue looks at Carrie with deep regret and guilt.Carrie is taken to the principal\u0027s office with Ms. Desjardin as they try to explain what has happened (with the principal, Henry Grayle, severely uncomfortable with it). He tells Ms. Desjardin to handle the punishment of the girls that participated in the incident. The principal and Ms. Desjardin tell Carrie that they have called her mother to pick her up. Carrie goes completely white, begging them not to call her mom. Principal Grayle says they know the school has problems with her mother since the state disallowed her mother to home school Carrie, but Ms. Desjardin reassures her and says it will be okay. Carrie starts hyperventilating and a nearby water cooler shatters. Carrie leaves the office.Margaret comes to pick up Carrie. Nearby, Sue, Chris and her rough boyfriend Billy Nolan (Alex Russell) sit. Chris shows everyone the video of Carrie, who sees what Chris \u0026 the others are doing. Sue looks on at Carrie, and her face betrays more guilt.On the way home Carrie apologizes to her mother for making her come to school.When they get home, Carrie wants to talk to Margaret about why she didn\u0027t explain to her about her period. \"I thought I was dying,\" Carrie says. Margaret is evasive and tells her to come inside. Carrie tells her mother she won\u0027t; she wants to talk about what happened. As Carrie sits in the car, a local boy rides around it on his bicycle and calls her \"Crazy Carrie.\" Carrie apparently uses her powers to makes him fall off his bike, which scares him into fleeing.Inside the house, Carrie finds her mother banging her head on the wall. Carrie tells her to stop and just talk to her. Margaret, however, is more concerned with praying for forgiveness and creates her own bible verses on a whim to suit her needs. Carrie recognizes these \u0027verses\u0027 are not even real Bible verses and objects to her mother\u0027s prayers, but Margaret knocks her in the head with a bible. As their argument heads downstairs to the kitchen, Margaret calls her a sinner. \"I did not sin,\" Carrie says. Margaret opens the \"Prayer Closet\" and tells Carrie to get in. Carrie refuses so her mother throws her in and latches the door, telling her to pray for forgiveness. Carrie bangs on the door, begging to be let out. \"GOD, YOU SON OF A BITCH!\" Carrie screams, and then suddenly a crack is formed through the middle of the door to both their surprise. Carrie looks at a sculpture hanging on the wall of Jesus nailed to the cross. It begins to bleed to her horror.Meanwhile, Sue and her boyfriend, Tommy Ross (Ansel Elgort) are having sex in a jeep, though Sue\u0027s mind is somewhere else. They get dressed, and Sue talks about her guilt about what happened to Carrie and how she initially helped. Tommy relates he once beat a bully that had tormented him. He says the guy had it coming. \"What did Carrie White ever do you?\" Tommy asks.At the same time, Chris and Billy, along with another girlfriend, named Tina, hang out at her house. Chris is unrepentant about what she has done, and on a whim, decides to upload the video to YouTube, humiliating Carrie even further.Back at the White household, Margaret is making clothes and singing Bible songs. She eventually opens the closet and finds Carrie sleeping. She wakes her up and asks if she said her prayers. Carrie says yes, and Margaret becomes a loving mother again. They exchange \u0027I love you\"s.The next day, Ms. Desjardin lays down the law with Chris, Sue, and all the other girls that participated in Carries shaming. Ms. Desjardin asks about Chris and Sue\u0027s dates for the prom and tells Sue she would\u0027ve voted her Prom Queen but not anymore. Ms. Desjardin tells them it was a \"very shitty\" thing they did to Carrie and they are going to pay for it. She also mentions that apparently someone took a video of the incident, looking at Chris as she is pretty sure that she is the one who did it. They will be doing suicide sprints after school for a week. Anyone who refuses the punishment is suspended and cannot go to prom. \"While you run, I want you to think long and hard about what it would be like to be Carrie White,\" Ms. Desjardin says.After a while, Chris calls \"bullshit\" on the whole punishment, saying Ms. Desjardin can\u0027t do it. Sue tries to tell her to take the punishment and let it go but she won\u0027t. Chris refuses, so Ms. Desjardin suspends her and revokes her prom privileges. Chris says Ms. Desjardin can\u0027t take away prom from her and tries to rally the other girls to go with her. One by one, they refuse, including Sue, the only one who shows any true remorse. They continue to run while Chris screams: \"This is not over!\"Meanwhile, everyone snickers at Carrie, having seen the video. As Carrie walks down the hall, humiliated, she stares in disgust at graffiti that someone has sprayed across a bank of lockers saying, \u0027Carrie White eats shit\u0027. She goes in the bathroom and concentrates on the mirror. After a moment, she is able to smash it to her shock. Looking at the pieces she makes them levitate for a moment until another girl shows up. Carrie grabs her bag and leaves.Carrie goes to the library and looks to the web and numerous books about telekinesis. After seeing a video about telekinesis, she decides to test her own abilities with it in subtle ways. In class, Carrie looks at the flag outside the window, and makes it move. She smiles with a sense of accomplishment.Carrie is called to the front of the class and reads a favorite poem. It is quite dark, but well written and people pay attention to her. The teacher, Mr. Ullman, is amazed she has talked at all, and asked if she has something else to say after scaring the classroom. \"You asshole,\" Tommy mutters under his breath. The teacher asks what he said. Tommy said the poem was \"awesome\" and asks the teacher if he thought the same thing. Carrie looks at Tommy shyly and smiles.Meanwhile, Margaret is seen working at a dry cleaner/seamstress store. Someone calls out for help and it turns out to be Eleanor Snell, Sue\u0027s mother. She is picking up Sue\u0027s prom dress. Mrs. Snell tries to apologize for Sue\u0027s behavior and commends Margaret on the work she did. Meanwhile, Margaret is cutting herself on the leg with a needle, making herself bleed. \"These are godless times,\" Margaret says before returning to her work.Chris gets a meeting with Ms. Desjardin and Principal Grayle with her arrogant lawyer father to try and overturn her suspension and revoked prom privileges. Chris tries to play the victim, but Ms. Desjardin plays better hardball than her, saying there was a video uploaded and if Chris just proves it isn\u0027t on her phone, then she will get an apology and be allowed to go to prom. Her father tells her to give up the phone, but Chris refuses to and storms out, thus indirectly admitting her complicity and making sure her suspension and punishment stay active.Sue and the prom committee work on turning the gymnasium into the prom. Chris storms in, angrily telling her friends that she is banned from prom, and asks why the girls didn\u0027t back her up. She then asks why Sue didn\u0027t. Sue says because she deserved the punishment, they all did. Ms. Desjardin was right; they did a shitty thing to Carrie. Chris balks and says Carrie deserved it. \"What has Carrie White ever done to you?\" Sue asks her soon to be former friend. Chris tells Sue that she is not being high and mighty because she feels bad; it\u0027s because she wants to go to prom with Tommy then have sex with him in the hotel she already booked. \"You don\u0027t give a shit about Carrie White,\" Chris sneers, leaving.We see Sue at home, looking at her prom dress lovingly.Back at the White household, Carrie is in her room making books move, testing her powers. She eventually makes several levitate including her bed. Margaret hears the noise and takes a butcher knife to investigate. When she gets to Carrie\u0027s room, Carrie has fooled her, turning out the lights. Margaret puts the knife down and says she will never let anyone hurt her little girl. Carrie then accidentally causes the knife to stick into the floor, shocking Margaret.The next day, Sue watches Tommy play lacrosse. Sue comes up to Tommy and asks for a favor; she wants him to take Carrie to the prom. Tommy is shocked, saying he wants to take her, but Sue wants to do something to make up for the humiliation Carrie was put through. \"I\u0027m trying to fix what I did,\" she says. Tommy tries to convince her, but Sue says she can\u0027t go and begs him to help her make things right.Tommy finds Carrie at lunch and shocks her by talking to her. Tommy asks her about prom and if she would like to go with him. Carrie runs off without responding. Tommy tracks her down and asks again, but Carrie thinks it is a joke. \"Stop trying to trick me,\" Carrie says. \"I\u0027m not,\" Tommy replies. Carrie doesn\u0027t believe him however, and runs off.Carrie is crying in the locker room and is discovered by Ms. Desjardin. Ms. Desjardin thinks the girls did something again but Carrie says she got invited to prom. Ms. Desjardin says that\u0027s a happy thing and asks who asked her. Carrie says Tommy Ross. Ms. Desjardin, realizing something is up, stays neutral saying he is a cute boy. Carrie says she knows he dates Sue Snell and thinks this a big joke to him. \"They\u0027re going to trick me again,\" Carrie says. Ms. Desjardin says maybe not. Carrie ponders why Tommy would want to go with her. Ms. Desjardin directs Carrie to the mirror telling her she sees a beautiful girl and with the right dress and the tiniest dash of makeup she can stun everyone speechless.Ms. Desjardin confronts Sue and Tommy thinking they are planning something. \"If the two of you are planning some kind of joke on a poor, lonely, defenseless girl...\" Ms. Desjardin warns them. However, Sue says she is trying to do a good thing for Carrie; allow her one good night and a chance to be social. Tommy says it doesn\u0027t matter since Carrie said no, but Sue tells him to try again. Ms. Desjardin tries to appeal to Tommy saying he will look \u0027ridiculous\u0027 with Carrie on his arm, but Sue says this is a private matter and they don\u0027t care how they look doing it.Tommy drives over to Carrie\u0027s house and tells her he is not leaving till she says yes to prom. Fearful her mother will see them, Carrie says yes but that she will have to be home by 10:30 pm. Tommy says he will pick her up at 7:00 pm. Carrie smiles.Carrie goes into town and sees a dress shop. She looks at one in the store front and her body reflected onto it. Going inside, she sees that they are too pricey for what she can afford. She sees some fabric and stares at awe at the potential. From across the street, Chris and her friends see Carrie at the store and Chris seethes in rage. It is at this time that Chris begins to plot revenge against Carrie for what Chris sees as getting her banned from prom, and apparently enlists the help of her friends Tina, twins Nicki \u0026 Lizzy, and Heather.That evening, Carrie walks home seeing her mom waiting for her in the front yard. Margaret is livid since she didn\u0027t know where she was. Carrie says she went into town to buy fabric to make herself a gown. Margaret says she is not allowed to go anywhere but school and home. Carrie then tells her the news; she\u0027s been asked to prom. Carrie tells her that she knows she is scared and she is too. However, the kids laugh at her and think she is weird. She doesn\u0027t want to be weird; she wants to be normal and thinks prom may be her final chance. \"I have to try and be a whole person before it is too late,\" Carrie says. Margaret is livid and tells her to go to her closet and repent before it is too late. Carrie asks why she can\u0027t be happy for her. But the insane Margaret refuses to listen and orders Carrie to go to her closet. Carrie then has an episode and makes everything in the living room jump up. Margaret falls to the floor in shock and starts to pray. Carrie tells her mom to get up and when she doesn\u0027t, she raises her with her powers. Margaret calls Carrie a devil, but Carrie says she has powers and others have them too. Carrie states that her grandmother may have had them and it\u0027s possible that they skipped a generation to Carrie. Carrie places her mother down and her mother says she thought she was a cancer when she was born. Carrie tells her that is a horrible thing to say and levitates her again. She tells her she is going to prom, she will not stop her, and they are not talking about it anymore. Carrie then releases her.Meanwhile, Chris, Billy and a few others are at a pig farm. Billy callously crushes a pig\u0027s head and Chris slits the throat to collect the blood.The next day, Sue is working on the prom decorations when she feels sick. She runs to the bathroom and throws up. Shock hits her face; she thinks she is pregnant.We see Carrie make her prom dress. Chris and Billy break into the gymnasium and rig the pail with the pig blood. Billy tells Chris she can drop it on Carrie, and Chris states she has every intention of doing so.Sue puts her dress away, committing to her decision.We see a montage of the students get ready and dressed for prom. We see Carrie put her dress on and apply some light makeup. She has fully transformed herself into the beautiful woman she was meant to be.Margaret tells her she looks like a deviant. Carrie, having enough of her mother\u0027s overly religious quotes, asks that for once that her mom could be happy for her. Margaret says they are going to laugh at her, but Carrie says to stop it. Tommy is a nice boy and everything is going to be fine. As Tommy shows up, Margaret tells her daughter that she was conceived by what was basically marital rape and how she tried to kill her as a baby. Carrie, finally losing all her patience, force-chokes her mom. \"There will be a judgment Carrie\", Margaret says. Carrie opens the closet and locks her mother in with her powers, saying she will be back at 10:30 pm as promised. She then melts the door lock so her mother can\u0027t get out.Carrie goes outside to meet Tommy. \"Do I look okay?\" Carrie asks. \"You look beautiful,\" Tommy says, meaning it.They drive to prom in a limo. Carrie requests a moment, thinking about the other students. Tommy tells her despite what she thinks they aren\u0027t all bad. Calming her down, they go in, where she is introduced to Tommy\u0027s best friend and his girlfriend, who goes to another school. The other girl compliments Carrie on her dress, and is pleasantly surprised to find out that Carrie made it herself.Carrie begins to loosen up. Tommy asks if she wants to dance but they agree to wait till a slow one comes on, after Carrie sees some wild dance moves from another student and isn\u0027t sure what to make of them. Ms. Desjardin sees Carrie and tells her how beautiful she looks. While they talk, Tommy texts Sue, telling her that everything is okay, Carrie is enjoying herself and that he misses her. Sue smiles, content that she is making it right.A slow song comes on and Tommy convinces Carrie to dance with him. He teaches her how to slow dance and she quickly learns. Carrie puts her head on his shoulder then backs away. Something crosses Tommy\u0027s face when that happens; while he is still obviously loyal to Sue, he is starting to grow some feelings for Carrie due to her being such a sweet person. Carrie, still unsure about his intentions asks why he asked her to prom. Tommy says that he wanted to, and is having a good time with her and hopes she is feeling the same way. Carrie nods yes. Tommy then says they will enjoy their time here then they can go to an after party and he will have back home on time. Carrie smiles, agrees, and notes that she can maybe stay out till 11.Thanks to Chris\u0027s friend Tina, Billy and Chris break into the prom and sit in the rafters waiting. They hand off ballots to Tina\u0027s date, Greg Delois, who switches them out to rig the Prom King and Queen election to ensure Carrie \u0026 Tommy are elected.The voting for Prom King and Queen begins. Carrie questions voting for herself but Tommy tells her there isn\u0027t much to it, and she should have one chance to be in the spotlight. Carrie notes that the crowns are beautiful. \"The Devil with false modesty,\" Tommy says. Carrie is convinced so they vote for themselves. Meanwhile, Chris\u0027s friends switch out the ballots to rig them in Tommy and Carrie\u0027s favor.Chris texts on her cell phone to Sue while Sue is getting out of the shower. She says \"Your girl looks good. She won\u0027t for long.\" Horror washes over Sue\u0027s face; she knew Chris was vindictive but not to this extent. Sue realizes that Chris has planned something horrifying to humiliate Carrie, and races to prom to try to stop her.Chris seems to have second thoughts for a moment. Billy reminds her that what they are doing is criminal assault, and they need to flee the second they are done.Meanwhile, Sue gets to the building but can\u0027t get in. She sees someone open the door and sneaks in.The \"ballots\" are counted. Tommy and Carrie win. Carrie is stunned but happy. They walk up to the podium with everyone applauding. Ms. Desjardin, Mr. Ullman, and Principal Grayle are especially happy for Carrie, glad to see that she has finally got her moment in the sun.Sue looks around and sees Chris in the rafters. Chris sees Sue looking at her. She hesitates momentarily, but Billy goads her on to pull the rope. Ms. Desjardin sees Sue and misconstrues her reasons for being there and throws her out of the building without hearing her warning.Chris pulls the rope. Although the rope jams and forces Chris to pull on it several times, it eventually gives way and the pig blood cascades down and drowns Carrie in it. Complete and utter silence follows. \"WHAT THE HELL?!\" Tommy yells at everyone, having and wanting no part in this unbelievable act of cruelty. Chris has hacked the video monitors, and using her iPhone, plays Carrie\u0027s period video. Most of the class laughs, but Ms. Desjardin, along with a few others, are in complete shock. Ms. Desjardin goes to Carrie but Carrie pushes her back with her powers, startling everyone.Chris and Billy rig the rope and begin to flee but Chris wants to stick around and see Carrie squirm. The rope, however, gives way and the pail that held the blood cracks Tommy on the back of the head, killing him instantly. Carrie turns back around and cradles his head in her lap, absolutely devastated that the only boy that ever treated her kindly has been killed. Carrie looks up in the rafters and recognizes Billy\u0027s sunglasses. She knows who is responsible. Something snaps in her mind. She turns to the guests, as the blood on her body starts to levitate off it. A few see this and try to flee in horror but it is no use.Carrie finally loses control and violently force-pushes the entire crowd back, people hitting tables and each other. She then slams all the doors of the gym shut and locks them, so no one can get out. One of the girls, Heather, is force-thrown across the room and has her head smashed into a closed door. Tina\u0027s date, Greg Delois, and a few other guys try to escape by climbing the bleachers, but Carrie collapses them, gorily crushing Greg to death. As a boy films her, she throws a table at him, the force of the hit killing him. Carrie then trips the sprinklers leaving the whole room soaked in water. As she sees the twin girls Nicki and Lizzy, friends of Chris, trying to flee, she forces-pushes them to the ground where they are trampled to death by the fleeing mob. Behind Carrie on the stage, a light fixture drops from the ceiling, touching off a fire on the stage and exposing several live electrical cables. Seeing Chris\u0027s friend Tina attempting to escape, Carrie force-throws a burning decoration at her but misses. Carrie then uses the live electrical cables to torture Tina, driving her back towards a smaller fire burning on the floor. The hem of the dress comes in contact with the fire, and in seconds the flames have engulfed the dress, causing Tina to burn to death. As flames envelop the room, Ms. Desjardin tries to calm Carrie down but Carrie grabs her in a Darth Vader-like force-choke hold and pulls her up, holding her for a moment above the floor that has become electrified as the electrical cables come in contact with the water from the sprinklers. However, her reasoning returns momentarily and she spares Ms. Desjardin, pulling her across to the stage, as she was one of the few people that were ever nice to her. Carrie then levitates herself out of the building as Ms. Desjardin and the few remaining students watch in horror and shock.By now the entire school is in flames. While people some escape, many don\u0027t. Carrie sees Chris and Billy\u0027s red car. Her rage returns.Chris asks Billy what they should do as their little prank is now responsible for at least a dozen deaths. Billy tells her they will leave town and never come back. Chris agrees reluctantly. As they drive off, Carrie is behind them. She stomps the ground and causes it to cave out ahead. Billy turns the car around and speeds back. Chris sees Carrie and despite everything, will not give up her vendetta. \"RUN HER DOWN. KILL HER!\" Chris snarls. Billy says he has it under control and charges Carrie. Carrie however is waiting for him and stops the car with her power, the force causing Billy to hit the steering wheel hard, breaking his nose, and causing his head to violently snap back and kill him instantly. Chris comes to a few minutes later, and realizes Billy is dead from the impact. She cries but when she sees Carrie, she reaches for the keys and backs up, still hell-bent on killing her. When she charges again, Carrie pulls the car\u0027s back wheels up high in the air, and then throws the vehicle into a gas station pump. The force of the throw causes Chris\u0027s face to go through the windshield making shards of glass embed all around her face. Carrie watches as Chris breathes her last breath. As an extra precaution and because Chris deserved it, Carrie causes a power pole to spark and collapse, igniting the leaking gasoline and causing an explosion that guarantees Billy\u0027s and Chris\u0027s deaths.Back at the burned gym, Sue sees Ms. Desjardin and they both sob at the destruction.Carrie begins to walk home, destroying everything in her path. When she gets inside, she sees her mom had forced a hole from the crack in the door and has escaped from the closet. Carrie calls out to her but gets no response. Her mother is hiding in the shadows.Carrie gets into the bathtub and cleans off all the blood, changing into a blue nightgown. She finds Margaret and tells her she was right about everything. They hug and Margaret suggests they pray. As they pray, Margaret takes her butcher knife and stabs Carrie once in the back. Carrie then pushes her mother back as she falls down the stairs. Their fight continues in the kitchen as Carrie begs her mother to stop what she is doing. \"You know a devil never dies. You gotta keep killing it,\" Margaret says, manic. They struggle and she slices Carrie on the leg and arm. When she tries to stab Carrie in the face, Carrie stops the blade with her powers and then pulls up numerous sharp objects and points them in her mother\u0027s direction. Telling her she is sorry, Carrie lets them fly, and they impale her mother to the wall as if in a crucifix-like pose.Carrie, horrified by what she is done, releases the blades that pin her mother to the wall. Margaret dies moments later in Carrie\u0027s lap. Carrie cries at the loss.Moments later, Sue arrives at the house. Carrie is angry with her saying she just killed her mother and she wants her back. \"Why couldn\u0027t you leave me alone?\" Carrie asks. Sue says she tried to help her. Carrie puts Sue in a force choke-hold as the house begins to collapse around them due to her powers becoming uncontrollable. \"Don\u0027t hurt me Carrie,\" Sue pleads. \"Why not?\" Carrie snarls. Then, Carrie puts Sue down. Sue tries to reach for Carrie so they can escape. Carrie places her hand near Sue\u0027s stomach. \"It\u0027s a girl,\" Carrie says. Sue looks at her in shock. \"You don\u0027t know?\" Carrie asks. Carrie pushes her out of the house. Sue watches as rocks come out of nowhere and fall directly on the house, collapsing it on itself. Carrie holds her mother and kisses her forehead as the house finally falls down on the both of them. Sue looks on in horror and gingerly touches her stomach.An undisclosed time later, Sue is giving a deposition in front of the whole town (as to her pregnancy subplot, it is very unclear whether Sue is still pregnant or not and/or she kept the baby). The man interviewing her asks if what she saw happen could\u0027ve been a natural accident. Sue however, stands by her story. Carrie was just a normal girl with normal hopes and desires like everyone else, and they pushed her and when people get pushed, eventually they break. They broke Carrie White.We see Sue at the graveyard where Margaret and Carrie are at a joint plot. Someone has spray painted \"CARRIE WHITE IS IN HELL\" on the gravestone with an arrow pointing down. Even in death, someone still had to be heartless to the poor, lonely girl who only wanted to be accepted. Sue lays a white rose at the grave and leaves. A moment later a force comes up from the ground, cracking the tombstone down the middle. In the middle, a crater forms in the shape of a heart. Carrie\u0027s ultimate fate is left ambiguous.","Weighted Degree":"2.0","numvotes":"138581","productioncompany":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM)","countriesoforigin":"United States, Canada","averagerating":"5.9","originaltitle":"Carrie","size":"1","genres":"Drama,Horror","storyline":"The outcast teenager Carrie White is bullied by her classmates at high school.

We are in Cairo in the year 1902 at a British military outpost. A man explains to Colonel Cross (Ralph Clanton) that his soldiers were attacked by the local people. A riot is underway outside and a rock crashes through the window and lands on the Colonel\u0027s desk. Captain Storm (Mark Dana) reports to the Colonel for a new assignment. He is to go south to the Valley of the Kings with a very small contingent to rescue an archeological expedition. To add to his challenge he is to take the wife of the expedition\u0027s leader along. It seems that this dig went out without Egyptian approval and the authorities are concerned the locals may attack and kill the members of the dig. The planned route is the long way because it is safer.The rescue party on horseback crosses the desert. Leading the group is Capt. Storm, followed by Sylvia Quentin (Diane Brewster). The third in line is Sgt. Gromley (Richard Peel), followed by a man with a beard, Sgt. Smolett (Terence de Marney). They stop at an oasis for water and to rest. Storm turns on the charm and explains how things are done to Mrs. Quentin. Sylvia assures Storm she is accustomed to hardship. The group beds down for the evening in a brushy area of the desert. This gives Sylvia and Storm a chance to get better acquainted. Sylvia is perceptive and tells Storm he must have had one woman immune to his charms. The horses get spooked and Storm investigates. Gromley and Smolett join the captain, armed and ready for the intruder. Storm sees a woman, alone, approach their fire. Simira (Ziva Rodann as Ziva Shapir) explains that she is alone, and she is not lost. She was drawn by the light of their fire. She declines the food and water offered, and explains she is traveling to find her brother, Numar, who is helping the expedition with the tomb of Rahateb. Simira knows her brother is with them, and warns, \"You must hurry before it is too late.\" She offers to lead them on a more direct route, but Storm is reluctant to trust this stranger. They allow her to join them, but on the longer, safer route. The rescue party goes to bed and Simira reclines in the nearest tree.The next morning Gromley rouses Smolet, who is supposed to be on guard. He notices one of the mules, Mabel, is missing. She was carrying the food. They search but there are no hoof prints. They continue south. Simira walks behind the horses. Storm calls a halt and tries to convince Simira to ride one of the pack animals, but she again declines the offer. She tells Storm, \"I do not tire, Captain. The desert is my strength. You had better keep the animals for yourselves.\" Gromley checks the water container and finds it empty. He blames his colleague, Smolet, but also grows more suspicious of the stranger in their camp. Simira rubs a cat charm on a necklace around her neck.That evening, as the party gets sleep, a scorpion steals into camp. It stings Sylvia on the arm. When Storm calls for the medical kit, Gromley discovers the kit is missing, along with Simira. Storm uses a knife to cut Sylvias arm and he sucks out the poison. He uses the makeshift tourniquet to bandage the wound.The next morning Simira wanders back into camp. She claims she went the short way and reached the pass. Storm tells her Sylvia was stung by a scorpion. Simira insists they take the short route if Sylvia is to survive. Storm agrees to the change in routing, but promises Simira if it is a trap he will kill her first.At the tomb, Walter Andrews (Ben Wright) reads the cartouche, \"Let ye who seeks to disturb the eternal peace and sleep of the high priest beware. Flesh of my flesh shall creep into thy body and eat of the flesh of thy spirit until such time as he shall return into the pit of everlasting darkness, which he lived before life.\" The expedition leader, Robert Quentin (George Neise) orders the seal on the sarcophagus be broken. Andrews warns against desecrating the tomb. Quentin asks the opinion of Hans Brecht (Kurt Katch). Brecht replies, \"It is what we came for.\" Next he asks Claude Beauchamp (Robert Fortin). The little French alcoholic indifferently answers, \"What does it matter what I think, Robert. You will do what you want anyway.\" Beauchamp continues his sketches of the tomb. Quentin turns last to Dr. Michael Farraday (Guy Prescott). Farraday replies hes a man of science and he doesn\u0027t know much about superstition. Quentin stares at Numar (Alvaro Guillot) as if to ask his opinion, thinks better of asking a native, and then cuts open the seal on the lid.The rescue party now follows Simira across the desert. They arrive at a high point above the tent covered encampment below. Simira grimaces and clutches the charm on her necklace. She announces, \"We are too late. Theres no chance to help now. It is too late.\"In the tomb, Quentin and Brecht remove the lid over Andrew\u0027s objection. Inside is the mummified remains of the high priest. Farraday cuts into the wrappings on the head with a scalpel. As he does, Numar drops the torch he is holding and clutches the side of his face. He falls to the floor unconscious. Storm walks into the chamber carrying a torch.Storm confronts Quentin in his tent. He informs the leader, \"Tomorrow we seal up the tomb, and that\u0027s final.\" He adds that as soon as Sylvia is ready to travel they ride back to Cairo. Farraday stops in to talk to Quentin. He tells Quentin his wife is fine, but exhausted. He also reports that Numar is also fine, just a little shock. He adds that his sister, Simira is with him in his tent. Quentin visits with his wife in her tent. She is reluctant to give her husband the bad news. Quentin tries to convince her to be sick a little longer to delay their departure. She wanted to end their relationship in person. Her husband tries to explain what he did for her, then finally concludes Storm may have influenced her. Quentin next visits Beauchamp in the work tent. He is drinking and working on the diary and sketches. Brecht and Andrews are still working on the translation on the stone tablet. Quentin wants to find the king\u0027s tomb. Storm goes to Quentin\u0027s tent to talk, but the expedition leader is not there. He grabs a torch and walks into the tomb complex to find Quentin. There is a minor rock fall, but Storm continues his search. He hears someone using a pick on the wall and follows the sound. He finds Quentin and reminds him he ordered everyone out of the tomb. Quentin shows Storm that the mummy is missing and cat prints on the floor lead to a solid wall. Quentin storms off to confront Numar. He threatens the young man, but the doctor explains that Numar is now ill, very ill. His skin and teeth show rapid aging. Numar has a long scar down his face and his hair has turned gray. Quentin is obsessed with the tomb and shows no regard for Numar or his wife.Gromley shoots at Numar entering the tomb. One of the animals is discovered drained of all its blood. Storm tries to get answers from Simira, but only gets the same words of warning unheeded. He confines her to her tent. Storm, Quentin, Beauchamp, Farrady, and Gromley enter the tomb carrying torches. They split up to search the tomb passages for Numar. Quentin and Beauchamp find what might be the tomb of the king. Beauchamp sarcastically observes that Quentin needed more time and got it. Gromley enters a chamber and looks around, but his torch is extinguished by a gust of wind. A door opens and Numar, now very old, approaches the Sergeant. Gromley fires several shots from his revolver directly into Numar, but it has no effect and he continues to approach. He attacks. Later we learn that Gromley\u0027s blood was rapidly and completely drained. The noise draws the others to the chamber where they discover the body.Andrews and Brecht complete the translation on the stone tablet. They relay the contents. It is a letter from Rahateb to his high priest regarding his funeral arrangements. The high priest is to commit suicide and guard the king after the king\u0027s death. Andrews notes that when the high priest\u0027s mummy was disturbed the trouble started. Storm now decided they must remain to solve the mystery and the death of one of his soldiers. The entire party reenters the tomb to work. Brecht goes off alone to explore the tunnels in the tomb complex. Quentin is working on the wall with a pick. Storm finds an opening above their chamber and explores the room. Brecht explores a chamber room. A door swings open and he crawls under it and into another room. It is well stocked with statues and other treasures. A door opens and an even more decrepit Numar exits approaching Brecht. He attacks Brecht, but the man, barely alive, escapes the room with scratches on his face. Storm enters the hidden room and fires at the retreating Numar. He grabs Numar\u0027s arm as the door closes. The arm is torn off in the process.Farraday examines the arm and exclaims, \"Unbelievable. His body disintegrating. Turning into dust.\" Storm makes an appeal to Simira to help them find her brother, but she again repeats her chant of, \"Tried to warn, tried to help, you would not listen.\" She is escorted back to her tent. Sylvia appeals to Storm to give up so they can leave. In her tent she sees the shadow of a cat, but at the entrance Simira enters. Simira stares at Sylvia, who runs from her tent. Simira pulls off her necklace. Sylvia makes her way into the tomb complex. She feels her way around trying to find her colleagues. An arm grabs Sylvia and she screams, but it is only Smolet. He heads Sylvia to her husband. They walk into the secret room. She relays her story about Simira to the group. They return outside looking for Simiar. Andrews and Quentin remain behind. Quentin pulls a gun on Andrews and tries to beat the location of the king\u0027s chamber out of him. The door flies open and Numar is there looking worse than ever. He turns and walks deeper into the tomb of Rahateb and Quentin follows. Quentin only gets a few feet inside when the ceiling collapses killing and burying him.Outside, Storm searches each tent for Simira with no luck. It is then they notice Quentin and Andrews missing. They enter the tomb complex and see the remains of the expedition leader. Beauchamp sees Simira\u0027s shadow on the wall and finds her amulet. As the group exits the tomb complex they find the sarcophagus lid back in place. They open it and cut the wrapping on the mummy. There they find Numar as an ancient, decayed mummy. Numar is now the high priest, destined to guard his king. Simira is the cat goddess. They replace the lid and exit the tomb. They bury their dead and depart on their horses. Beauchamp destroys his notes and sketches because he feels no one would believe his story. He drops the cat amulet and we close with the remaining members of the expedition and rescue party riding off on their horses.","Weighted Degree":"1.0","numvotes":"619","productioncompany":"Schenck-Koch Productions","countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"4.7","originaltitle":"Pharaoh\u0027s Curse","size":"1","genres":"Horror Only","storyline":"Archaeologists in Egypt find one of their crew has been turned into a blood sucking mummy after they have unleashed a three thousand year curse by entering a Pharaoh\u0027s tomb. —Ray Baden","Clustering Coefficient":"0.0","genre":"Horror Only","Number of triangles":"0"},"color":"rgb(90,104,47)","size":32.95082092285156},{"label":"Honeymoon of Horror","x":-291.72137451171875,"y":1115.7197265625,"id":"tt0058205","attributes":{"year":"1964","runtimeminutes":"82","Weighted Degree":"4.0","numvotes":"54","productioncompany":"Flamingo","countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"3.5","originaltitle":"Honeymoon of Horror","size":"2","genres":"Horror Only","storyline":"The new bride of a strange sculptor finds that many of her new husband\u0027s friends want her dead.","Clustering Coefficient":"0.0","genre":"Horror Only","Number of triangles":"0"},"color":"rgb(90,104,47)","size":19.180328369140625},{"label":"body as art","x":-209.54762268066406,"y":-93.55033111572266,"id":"body as art","attributes":{"Clustering Coefficient":"0.0","Weighted Degree":"6.0","Number of triangles":"0"},"color":"rgb(97,95,121)","size":-20.983606338500977},{"label":"Kaatskill Kannibals","x":714.6500244140625,"y":1536.048828125,"id":"tt12786230","attributes":{"year":"2020","runtimeminutes":"55","synopsis":"A young man, Bruyn LeFevre, receives a letter informing him that he has inherited a castle in the Catskill Mountains of Upstate New York. Bruyn meets his girlfriend Jezebel in a local bar and shares the news with her. A punk rock band plays the song \"What You Gunna Eat?\" in the background. He and his girlfriend Jezebel Buxton leave Brooklyn with another couple, Rod Ramington and Anatolia Grossentitten, to claim the ancestral inheritance.   They two couples arrive at the castle and are greeted by a freaky hooded caretaker named Rollo. He shows the couples to their separate rooms. When he is with Bruyn and Jezebel in their room, he begins to tell the group of the cannibalistic history of Bruyn\u0027s LeFevre Family.   Rollo\u0027s flashback story begins in 1664 outside of Kingston, NY. The French Huguenot settlers leave the Dutch city of Wiltwyck (present day Kingston, NY) to establish their own settlement in New Paltz, NY. They nearly starve to death that first winter and to survive they decide to eat the Esopus Indians who had tried to feed them. The cannibal legacy of the LeFevre Family begins. The Huguenots begin inbreeding and living in the woods because they have developed a liking for human flesh.   The tale continues as Rollo tells that British troops, who have taken the region from the Dutch, capture a band of the New Paltz cannibals and burn them at the stake the during the reign of Charles II in 1674.   Later, in 1789, the new American country tries to rid itself of the cannibal scourge. A band of inbred colonial cannibals is dispatched by guillotine.   Rollo\u0027s saga of inbred cannibal feasting then jumps to the Civil War in 1863. The incestuous cannibal offspring attack and devour a bagpiper playing \"John Brown\u0027s Body.\" A troop of union soldiers stumbles across the cannibal band and shoots them down like dogs with their musket volleys. His mad tale ends in peals of demented laughter.   Rollo leaves the room and the stunned couple begin to unpack and relax on the bed. Suddenly cannibal women climb out from under the bed and cannibal men enter through the door and devour the newly arrived couple from NYC. It is a scene of bloody orgy.   The other couple, Anatolia and Rod, are unaware of this development. Anatolia senses something horrible and begins searching the castle for Rod. She runs through the castle calling for Rod who can\u0027t be found. She runs outside looking for him there and rings a bell in warning. She runs to a small red wooden shed and opens the door. She sees Rod\u0027s eaten corpse inside and is grabbed by a laughing, machete- wielding cannibal and killed.   Three days later a nymph is eating a picnic in a field waiting for her lover to meet her. She goes swimming in a river and is surprised by the cannibal band. They chase her back to her picnic blanket and devour her. Meanwhile across town a young girl runs to fetch a priest. The demon has returned to re-possess her mother. The priest, Father Peter, performs a violent exorcism. To refresh himself afterwards he goes for a walk in the deep woods. Fr. Peter stumbles across the cannibal altar and a statue of their hideous god, Moloch. He realizes that a cannibal cult is in the area and he phones a priest friend to meet him with dynamite and guns to destroy the statue, the altar, and the inbred cannibal cult.   Meanwhile, Dixon Orchard is the home base of the cannibal cult. They ride motorcycles and chase down an unsuspecting duo of Clyde and Deke who are passing through the orchard. Deke and Clyde are trapped on a bridge by the cannibals. Deke has a gun, but is overwhelmed and eaten. Clyde jumps to his death from the bridge rather than be eaten by the cannibals.   The cannibals organize a large feast in celebration. They roast several victims and are singing songs, dancing, drinking, and eating human flesh. They begin chanting \"Moloch\" and worshiping their idol when the three priests arrive, Fr. Peter, Fr. Kevin, and Fr. Patrick, and begin shooting the cannibals with pistols. As most of the cannibals are shot down, one cannibal starts a chainsaw and attacks the priests. He too is gunned down. The wounded cannibals are all shot again. Then Fr. Patrick places a large charge of dynamite in the idol and they detonate it. The idol explodes and breaks into pieces on the ground. The demonic spirit of the idol emerges from it and dances in the night sky.   Afterward, a couple walks into a nearby Deli and realizes that the workers are slicing human limbs on the meat slicers. The cannibal deli workers then attack the unsuspecting couple and chase them from the store.

Mother Rukh (Violet Kemble Cooper), seated in a chair, inquires whether her son Dr. Janos Rukh (Boris Karloff) is still working in his lab. Diane confirms this, saying that he is preparing for the delegation of scientists due to arrive from England. Rising from her chair with help from Diane, Mother Rukh comes to the window with her cane. She tells Diane that on a day like this her son Janos discovered the ray from Andromeda while working with his late father. It was holding the lens during that discovery which caused her permanent blindness. They discuss the brilliance of Janos and how he was rejected by other scientists and called a charlatan. Diane says she was told to watch for the headlights coming and notify Janos. Mother Rukh returns to her seat and Diane looks out the window again. Seeing the car approaching, she announces that she will go tell her husband. She dons her cape and goes through an outer walkway to another building where she rings a bell and enters. Coming into the lab, she tells Janos (who is gazing through a large telescope) that the visitors are arriving. He says he is ready and confident.The car pulls up and several people get out and enter the house. Diane greets Lady Arabella Stevens (Beulah Bondi) who introduces her husband Sir Francis Stevens (Walter Kingsford), Dr. Felix Benet (Bela Lugosi) and her nephew Ronald Drake (Frank Lawton). They are introduced to Mother Rukh who speaks but remains seated. Janos enters and greets each one and is greeted by Lady Arabella who presents her nephew Ronald who she says is a mapmaker and will be valuable to the work in Africa. Janos tells them he has a presentation to show them.In the lab, he shows his telescope, explaining and showing a device which will capture a ray from Andromeda containing pictures and information from thousands of years ago. Dr. Benet looks at Sir Francis with a knowing look of doubt between them. Janos attaches the device to the telescope and tells them to wait a few moments while he prepares the projector. Coming back from another room wearing a welding mask, he reaches into a panel and starts a series of electrical devices which give off sparks and energy. He announces he is ready. Diane leads the way to seats which are protected from dangerous rays by a new kind of barium crown glass, which is explained by Janos. He tells them about the distances the ray has traveled and turns on the projector, which is the type used in planetariums to show outer space. As he narrates, the picture shows a movement that passes our moon, Saturn, Orion and finally Andromeda. He tells Sr. Francis that he had previously predicted a meteor which struck Earth many years ago in Africa, telling him that this will prove it. As they watch, the view changes direction back toward Earth as seen from Andromeda but millions of years ago. A meteor is shown hurtling towards Earth and striking in the southern portion of Africa. Those viewing this are stunned. Various comments are made, saying this is no hoax.Back in the house, brandy is served. Sir Francis marvels at the discovery to Janos, asking when he will publish it to the scientific world. He says it is not yet ready. Sir Francis says it would be good to locate this meteor and see what it contains. Dr. Benet suggests that Janos join them in an expedition. Janos says he has no standing before their scientific congress and that he had previously been declared unorthodox and discredited. Sir Francis tells him their expedition will not be under the auspices of any scientific association. Dr. Benet says that he will be doing them an honor. Janos accepts, but Mother Rukh tells him no. She says he may make an important discovery but that it will not bring him happiness. She reminds him that Janos is not good with people but is better suited to remain with his experiments.A scientific magazine is shown that has an article about Dr. Benets expedition to Africa to recover Radium X. It mentions that Dr. Rukh has separated from the others. Meanwhile, at a camp in Nigeria, Dr. Benet shows Sir Francis how he has been healing natives by a medicine he derived from sunlight. A young native child is shown and given back to his mother. Diane sits in her tent, hot, tired and bored to death since her husband left them to go on his own expedition. She emerges from her tent only to see Lady Arabella and Ronald returning from a hunting trip. Seeing him stirs her. She turns away, not wanting to look. A conversation with Ronald and Lady Arabella about Diane reveals that they are interested in each other, but that Ronald dares not act because she is married. Meanwhile Sir Francis says he is sick of staying in Africa and will not remain for the sake of anyone.A safari group accompanying Janos arrives near a volcano when suddenly a loud buzzing and clicking sound coming from one of the boxes carried by a native frightens him. It is revealed to be a Giger counter showing the presence of radioactivity. Janos takes the machine and approaches a site giving off steam or smoke. He tells the leader to send a message back to the camp by his fastest runner. A runner is selected by the leader and Janos writes out a message, telling him to give it to Diana and wait for an answer. He says he has found what he is looking for, but not to tell anyone where they are.Antelope stew is served at the camp, but not everyone is interested in eating. Diane and Ronald avoid glances over the table at each other, but it is obvious that they are mutually interested in each other and this causes great discomfort. About this time the runner arrives and the note is given to Diane, who reads it. She reports only that Janos will not return right away but believes he is on the right track. Going to her tent, she asks the leader to meet with her and the runner. A small team is prepared to accompany her to see her husband. This is observed by Ronald, who then confronts Diane of her plans. She tells him she must go to her husband right away. He tells her hes not surprised that she wouldnt disappoint any man.Dressed in a protective suit and helmet, Janos is lowered into the volcano by rope controlled by natives. He uses a mining hammer to extract a sample of glowing, sparkling rock which he puts into a safe container. Returning to the natives, he is told they do not like the area because there are many devils. After the leader tells him they all want to leave, he tells them to watch a rock standing alone on a precipice. Loading the rock sample into a projector, he focuses it on the rock and shines the beam. The rock is disintegrated and melted before their eyes. He tells them they may leave if they want to, but threatens to turn the ray on them if they do. They beg and pledge their continued support.That night a meal is brought to Janos by one of the natives. He tells him to take the lantern inside the tent so it will not attract bugs. When the light is taken away, Janos begins glowing in his hands and face. Seeing this, the native cries out in horror. Janos sees his hands glowing and enters the tent. Turning down the lantern, he grabs a mirror and sees his face glowing. When the light is turned on, the glow cannot be seen. He remarks to himself that it has poisoned him. Sitting down on his cot to think, the dog approaches him and he reaches to pet it. The dog dies, and Janos realizes that his touch is deadly.Diane and her party arrive and she is pointed toward his tent. Seeing her coming, Janos draws the tent closed and turns out his lantern, hoping she will not enter. She notices the light go out and stops at the tent door to call him. Not wanting her to see or touch him, Janos questions why she came and tells her she must leave in the morning. She is shown a tent for her to stay the night, but is heartbroken and cries upon her cot. Janos gathers up the rock sample along with his mask and protective suit and starts out into the dark. Passing close by her tent, he hears her sobbing and pauses.Dr. Benet is shown mixing chemicals in his tent. Wearing full protective gear, Janos shows up with the runner and calls out to Benet, entering the tent. He tells Benet not to touch him, saying that he found the element and it is ten times more powerful than radium but that it has poisoned him. They step outside into the darkness and Benet witnesses Janos hands and face glowing. Confessing that his touch is deadly, they re-enter the tent. Janos asks Benet for help. Benet says there is an antidote for radium poisoning which is made from radium. Janos gives him a sample of the element and his chemical analysis which he has written down. Benet says he will begin at once to develop an antidote and that Janos can hide in a small equipment tent.Diane leaves on her way back to base camp. Meanwhile, Dr. Benet wakes Janos, and shows him in the dark that his skin no longer glows. He tells him that the antidote was given him at midnight and that the effect is only temporary. Touching his hand, he demonstrates that Janos is not lethal at this time, but cautions him that he must take doses of this daily for the rest of his life or the condition will recur and eventually kill him. Janos is given the formula on paper as well as a kit containing samples of the antidote and a syringe.Diane and Ronald have a discussion about their relationship, saying there is no point in denying it now. At this point a bell rings, calling them to supper.Natives sound jungle drums. Dr. Benet arrives at Janos camp and approaches him. When asked how Benet found him, he is told they followed the sound of the drums, which stated that a white man had found magic in the mountains. They go into the tent and Janos tells him that he has harnessed the power of the element to destroy cities. Benet asks if he can develop its power to heal and do good. Saying that will come later, he brags about his great discovery. Benet tells him that this was anticipated by himself and Sir Francis and that they must all share the discovery. Benet says Stevens is on his way to present the sample to the International Scientific Congress meeting in Paris. Janos argues that it is his discovery and says they are stealing it from him. Benet assures him that Janos will receive credit for it but reminds him they are united for a common purpose and that this element is too powerful and important to entrust to just one man. He says that Diane has taken ill and gone back to England. Janos is given a note from his wife, telling him that she believes that he no longer loves her and is now involved with someone else. Benet confirms that it is Drake. This further infuriates Janos, who tells Benet to leave before he turns the ray on him. Benet leaves.A newspaper shows that the Benet expedition has left Africa and that Dr. Rukh has returned to his lab in the Carpathian Mountains. Inside, Janos turns the ray on his mothers eyes, hoping to restore her sight. After a few moments, she confirms that she can see. She tells him he has much work to do, but he tells her he is leaving in the morning for Paris. She warns him not to go, for he will find tragedy there. In case of tragedy, he says, keep the formula which he has written down and sealed in an envelope for his mother to keep.In Paris we see Dr. Benet in his office who sees many patients, using the ray to heal. One girl has her sight restored and she and her parents rejoice. At this moment Janos arrives and Benet tells him that his discovery is helping to heal many people. Benet tells Janos that the Nobel Prize has been awarded to Janos and that all Paris is waiting to honor him. Janos says it looks like he is late again and declares that only he can correctly harness its power. Benet reminds him that is why the discovery was too important to entrust to just one man. Saying the counter-active is still working, Janos asks about Diane. He is told that she is working for Lady Arabella and that she and Ronald are in love. Benet tells him that Diane will do nothing until she hears from Janos. He replies that will happen soon enough and leaves.Wandering through the city, Janos finds a man who looks like himself and promises to help the man. About the same height and build, they go off together.Lady Arabella is seen dictating to Diane, who types onto paper. The maid comes bringing the newspaper and giving it to Arabella. She reads the headline and gives it to Diane. It shows that Dr. Rukh has been found dead, his body mutilated by the effects of the Radium X.Diane and Ronald are seen at their wedding at the Church of the Six Saints. As they are leaving, Janos watches from a distance as they get into a car to leave. He looks up at the statues of the six saints and pictures each of them as representing himself, Benet, Diane, Ronald, Arabella and Francis. Taking a room facing the church, he plots to kill each of the other five people.At the Stevens home, Arabella is talking to Benet about the marriage and noted that Sir Francis has not come down from his room. She sends the butler up to see about him. Before the butler can get halfway up the stairs, one of the maids comes screaming into his arms. He goes up to see while Arabella questions the maid. She cannot speak but only screams. Rushing back down, the butler calls for Dr. Benet to come, saying only  Sir Francis! Sir Francis!. Entering his room, they find Francis dead on his bed with a look of horror on his face. Dr. Benet asks for an ultraviolet camera which he uses to shoot pictures of Francis eyes. Developing them, he sees captured in the reflection on the mans cornea the image of Janos.The next day there is a disturbance in the square below. The landlady (May Beatty) brings Janos his breakfast and the morning paper, telling him that one of the statues was destroyed. He sees in the paper the death of Sir Francis. Gazing at the second statue, he calls the name of Lady Arabella.The next day the papers announce the death of Lady Arabella, the third death in wake of the curse of Radium X. Diane and Ronald come into the bedroom where Dr. Benet and the authorities are with the body. He tells Diane not to look and for Ronald to take her away. Then he asks to show the Chief of the Surete (Georges Renavent) some evidence. As the lights are turned out, the cover is pulled back to reveal a glowing handprint on the victims neck. Benet says it was done by someone poisoned by Radium X. Meanwhile Diane blames herself for the deaths, saying they would all still be alive if she hadnt come on the expedition and married Ronald. He tells her not to think like that, saying he will fight with all his strength. She says how can you fight something you cannot see or touch?The paper headline shows that the second statue has been destroyed and people are upset. A discussion is held with Benet, Ronald and the Chief about Janos. It is suggested that the two men go into hiding. Ronald proposes a trap to draw Janos so they can arrest him. Benet says for the papers to announce that the remaining three will leave for an unknown destination after holding a lecture on Benets experiments with Radium X. He will invite distinguished scientists who will only be admitted by card which the police promise to verify. Benet warns that if the police fail to stop him at the gate that the house lights will be darkened at midnight (the time of the lecture) so that Janos can be seen glowing. It is a risk they are willing to take.The night of the lecture, the police are seen checking the cards of each scientist who enters. In the rain the last scientist, Professor Meiklejohn (Frank Reicher) is seen walking with his umbrella. Janos appears and stops him, introducing himself as someone else who remembers his lecture on radiology. Saying he is on the way to the lecture, the Professor locates his card in his pocket. Janos suggests they have a drink of Napoleon Brandy from his flask. They step aside and the flask is handed to him to drink. The touch kills Meiklejohn, who collapses. Janos takes the card and enters in his place. The police confirm him and he enters but remains outside so he can observe through a window.Inside, Benet greets everyone and tells them he must make final adjustments. Entering his lab with a gun, Benet looks around and heads for the outside door, opening it. Janos comes in and confronts him. The light is turned off, showing his glowing face and hands. Janos tells him he will kill the remaining three. Benet asks if he ever feels like he used to before the poison altered his brain. Janos answers  not often now.. When Benet reaches for his gun, Janos grabs his arm, killing him.Diane waits upstairs but is very anxious to come down. There is a knock at the door and it is opened, revealing Mother Rukh entering. Ronald greets her and she is told that Diane is upstairs. At that moment the lights are cut in the whole place. Diane lights a candle and Janos is seen going upstairs with his glowing face. She rushes into the bedroom and tries to close the door but he forces it open. He approaches to try and touch her but hesitates. Trying again, he announces he is unable to kill her and goes out. She faints. Outside on the landing, he faces his mother who tells him he broke the first rule of science. He says he needs time so he can kill Drake, taking out his kit for more of the antidote. As he does this, Mother Rukh strikes it with her cane tip, destroying the contents. As he begins to smoke, he tells her that maybe its better this way. Turning away, he goes upstairs and crashes through a window, falling to the ground below as a fireball. There is nothing left. The head of the Scientific Congress congratulates Mother Rukh for her sons work. Handing him the envelope, she says that he is dead but part of him will continue to help mankind.","Weighted Degree":"6.0","numvotes":"2517","productioncompany":"Universal Pictures","countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"6.6","originaltitle":"The Invisible Ray","size":"2","genres":"Horror,Sci-Fi,Thriller","storyline":"Visionary scientist Janos Rukh convinces a group of scientists and supporters to mount an expedition to the African continent to locate and study an ancient meteorite of great significance.

After the class ends and the students leave, the projector remains on and begins performing oddly, flashing images that disturb and confuse Jennifer. Meanwhile, other strange phenomena presents itself to Father Lyle Dey (George Newbern), who experiences nightmares of a ghostly unknown presence. At the same time, Beth Patterson (Gabrielle Anwar) is haunted by nightmares of a girl she does not recognize. She has become obsessed with this unknown girl, sculpting her face into clay and repeatedly asking the sculpture to tell her who she is. While sculpting, Beth ignores a call from her therapist, who leaves a message expressing concern over Beth\u0027s nightmares and the added stress of the recent suicide of a childhood friend. As the message is playing, Beth becomes more and more stressed, eventually ripping the jaw off of the clay face.Soon thereafter, Jennifer, Lyle, and Beth gather at the funeral of their mutual childhood friend, along with three other old friends: Brent Sykes (Frank Whaley), Gina Conte (Traci Lords), and Wayne Morrison (Dan DeLuca). After the funeral, the six leave the graveyard and go to their friend\u0027s home. Following instructions in their friend\u0027s will, they look for and find a box containing a letter and a map. The map marks the location of a time capsule that the group buried together many years ago. The letter apologizes for the friend\u0027s suicide but asks that the remaining friends face the past and the things forgotten together. The letter ends by reminding them that they will always be together. The only other item in the box is an old photograph of eight children standing in front of a baseball field. Brent comments that their group must not have been very bright since a baseball team requires at least nine players, not eight, but Lyle chides him by saying that Crazy Eights was simply a name.The six travel to their childhood hometown and use the map to find an old, dilapidated barn, where the time capsule has been placed in the upper level. The group opens the box to find various items that they owned in their youth, including Beth\u0027s paint brushes, a journal (which once belonged to the deceased friend), a slingshot, and a few other items. They decide to move the box outside by using a pulley to carry it out of a nearby window. While Jennifer, Lyle and Brent are attempting to lift the box out, Beth and Wayne talk outside. Beth notices a new scar on Wayne\u0027s forehead; when she asks him about it, he confesses that he does not know how he got it, and that the cut appeared right after a disturbing nightmare he had. Suddenly, the box drops behind them and smashes, having slipped from the pulley.When the group goes to the box again, they find that the bottom has split open, revealing a secret compartment which contains the skeleton of a tiny girl. The group is unsure of what to do, debating whether to simply leave or to involve the authorities. Brent angrily leaves the group, refusing to accept any responsibility or consequences for the unknown skeleton.Upon realizing that Brent still has the keys to the van, the others quickly catch up to him, although they are still undecided as to what to do about the box and its grisly contents. As the group attempts to drive away, they find themselves lost and continually returning to a large white house no matter which direction they travel in. Brent notices a figure standing near a few trees surrounding the house, and quickly leads the group to her location. The girl disappears once the group heads towards her, so they decide to enter the home to search for her. The group agrees to split up into two groups, in the hopes of finding the girl faster.Wayne and Gina walk around outside and find the entrance to the basement. Upon entering, Wayne just makes out the shadow of a person, but falls down the stairs and breaks his leg. Gina turns the basement\u0027s lights on as Wayne begs her not to leave him alone in the dark, and sets out for help. Meanwhile, the group inside sees that the house does not look as though anyone has lived there for a long time; Brent soon discovers a \"Condemned\" notice, stating that all trespassers will be shot without warning. Gina finds the others and notifies the rest of the group of Wayne\u0027s injury, and the group descends into the basement to aid Wayne, with Brent bringing anything from the van that might help them.Once all members of the group are in the basement, the door strangely shuts and locks. The group, now looking for any way out of the house, leave with Wayne in tow and travel down a tunnel which they hope will lead them to another exit. The tunnel opens out into an abandoned underground hospital, complete with an empty nurse\u0027s station and rooms with hospital beds. The group decides to split up again to search for an exit or anything that might help them. The group leaves Wayne in Beth\u0027s care, but she soon abandons Wayne to explore the halls and rooms. She stares into a mirror hanging off a wall at the nurse\u0027s station, and is startled to see her younger self staring back at her.Meanwhile, the abandoned Wayne hears a noise behind him and crawls over to a nearby window to investigate, the window inexplicably opened even though the outside is covered by bars. Behind him, a ghostly figure passes by and the window is suddenly closed, killing Wayne. The group soon returns to find Wayne\u0027s body, and upon managing to get him out, temporarily transfer it to the attic. Lyle and Gina take an obviously disturbed Beth to a room serving as a bedroom for multiple children in order to calm her down.Beth demands to be left alone, and Lyle and Gina reluctantly comply. When left alone, Beth begins sucking her thumb, and lies on a bed. Soon, a horrible creature visits, promising to remove her guilt if she \" reaches down, and pulls it out.\" Beth screams in response, and when the other five reenter the room, they find Beth\u0027s bloody body lying crumpled against a wall with her jaw torn off. This is eerily similar to the fate of Beth\u0027s sculpture she had crafted at the beginning of the story.Brent panics and flees the room, running away from the remaining members of the group. He enters a series of adjoined, lighted rooms, before discovering that again, the series of rooms loop in circles, with no exit. Brent yells and curses at whoever is tormenting him, and promises that when he escapes the building, he will burn it to the ground.Brent eventually returns to the other four. Gina, Lyle and Brent return to the room where they saw her reflection and break the mirror, discovering that it was a two-way mirror used to watch the previous occupants of the home. Brent somehow finds an exit, which leads to a room filled with a plethora of toys, and a large painting on the wall. Brent explains that \"compassion is the difference between a man and a beast.\" The remainder of the group walks along the length of the hall exposed by the broken mirror, eventually arriving at a room containing records. The records document the progress of \"subjects,\" among which were a savant and an autistic individual.Lyle comes to the conclusion that they were trying to teach these unfortunate subjects guilt. However, Jennifer rampages through the room and exposes a large butterfly graffiti made by the group when they were children. They discover a picture frame containing pictures of all of them as children, including the man who each child believed was his or her own father.Brent, meanwhile, drops to his knees and reads several quotes from a book in the time capsule, talking about how they cannot run. He comes to some sort of realization but a figure emerges from a pile of toys behind him and kills him before he can express it. Lyle suddenly recollects old, repressed memories hidden by pain and horror, about how the group of eight children escaped this home, where they had been experimented on.He recounts how they were forced to leave one of the members of the group, a fragile young girl named Karen, in a chest containing meaningful objects, promising to return and rescue her. He realizes that the time capsule is the chest, and that they had come back for the girl long ago, only to find her dead from suffocation. Gina, horrified by this realization, runs into a bathroom, vomiting in the toilet. The bathroom is filled with multiple bathtubs, and she leans against one, moaning. Suddenly, the horrible creature who took the lives of Wayne, Beth, and Brent emerges behind her and blinds her by gouging her eyes out. She begins to scream as Lyle and Jennifer race towards the bathroom, but the door is locked.Lyle and Jennifer manage to batter their way into the room, and quickly bind Gina\u0027s bleeding eyes with strips of cloth. They take her to the storage room, and leave her there, promising to return soon. Lyle convinces Jennifer that they must find and destroy all objects linking them to the dead girl, and implores her to split up to find the objects in a reduced amount of time. Gina reminds Lyle that Brent left a slingshot under a grate, near a truncated tunnel. Lyle finds the area, and reaches down to acquire the slingshot, when a hand grabs his. He quickly struggles and stumbles back, severely wounding his neck on a pike.Meanwhile, Jennifer finds a paintbrush under a filthy bed, and begins to walk back to the room where Gina is. The blinded Gina, unaware of her surroundings and left with a metal bar to defend herself, inadvertently kills Lyle when he enters the room. In Lyle\u0027s last breaths, he tells Gina that yet another object is in the tunnel. Gina runs back to the entrance of the basement, where a horrible creature behind her clasps its hand over Gina\u0027s mouth, suffocating her. Jennifer returns to the room, finding Lyle dead. She pleads for the resurrection of the dead man, before gathering the courage to burn the slingshot and the paintbrush in a garbage can.While burning the objects, the horrible creature (who is revealed to be Karen, the dead girl\u0027s spirit) who led the other group members to their deaths, taunts Jennifer, reminding her of how she left her in the chest. Jennifer asks, with a raising temper in her voice, what objects are left to burn.When she does not receive an answer, she deduces that she herself is the only thing left connected to Karen. While Jennifer prepares to plunge a shard of glass into her stomach to kill herself, a flashback is shown where a man talks to Karen about the \"project\" is shown, and the movie abruptly ends with the words, \"Do you know the meaning of guilt? Do you know the meaning of redemption?

She is being questioned by a doctor who shows her pictures of her family and asks if she can speak about the day that led her to being admitted to the hospital.The next scene shows her returning with her father and sister, Su-Yeon, to the family\u0027s secluded estate near a lake. The two sisters are reluctant to go inside the house where their stepmother awaits. Instead they go down to a pier by the lake where they relax by putting their feet in the water and enjoy the sunshine.Soon, they are called back to the house where they are greeted by the stepmother with a forced welcome. She chastises them for making her wait and taunts them by asking if they are feeling better after having been away. The two sisters are unresponsive and quickly leave to other parts of the house.At a tense family dinner, the stepmother announces she has invited the sister\u0027s uncle and his wife to dinner the next day. Su-Mi tells her stepmother she will not eat with them and the two sisters leave the table. Su-Mi tells Su-Yeon that if their stepmother ever goes after Su-Yeon to let her know.That night as Su-Yeon goes to sleep, she hears noises and the door to her bedroom creakily opens and a female hand sneaks around it. Su-Yeon pulls the covers over her head only to have them pulled back by an unseen force. Terrified, she runs out of her room to Su-Mi and tells her that someone has come into her room.When Su-Mi goes to investigate, she only finds her father sleeping, but her stepmom catches her and tells her not to wake him. She rejoins Su-Yeon and comforts her, telling her that she will always be with her and they fall asleep.Later, Su-Mi has a nightmarish dream about blood and a hand desperately slapping at the floor. She wakens to see something moving in her room. Crawling along the floor is the apparition of a woman whose face is covered by long black hair. The wraith becomes aware that Su-Mi is looking at her and she none too slowly floats over the top of her. The ghost is hanging in mid-air with blood running down her leg. A hand suddenly appears from under her dress. Su-Mi awakes with a start realizing everything she has witnessed was still a dream.Tension continues to rise among the three females as their menstrual cycles become synched together.Su-Mi finds several family photos which reveal that their stepmother was once a nurse her father worked with and apparently was also a live-in nurse for the girl\u0027s mother. Su-Yeon enters the room and Su-Mi discovers bruises on her arm, but when she angrily questions her if their stepmother was the cause, Su-Yeon refuses to answer and runs out. Su-Mi confronts her stepmother about Su-Yeons injuries. The stepmother angrily responds to Su-Mi by telling her that she is now the sister\u0027s mother and that they must accept it and bear the worst that life has to offer. She also questions if Su-Mi is feeling well.That night, the sister\u0027s uncle and his wife arrive for a visit. They dine with the father and stepmother, whose behavior is extremely exaggerated and odd. When she asks the uncle if he remembers a peculiar event he tells her he doesn\u0027t. She responds icily: \"Why don\u0027t you remember? Are you crazy?\"Suddenly, the uncle\u0027s wife starts to convulse. She is thrown to the floor and has a violent attack. When she recovers the uncle drives her home and she informs him that during her attack she saw a girl under the kitchen sink. The stepmother sees the girl too and tells the sister\u0027s father that ever since Su-Mi and Su-Yeon returned home weird things have been happening inside the house. The father seems unconvinced.The stepmother goes into Su-Yeon\u0027s room where she discovers that photos of her have been mutilated and her face has been scratched out. Enraged, she attacks Su-Yeon and throws her into a wardrobe closet and locks her inside and refuses to let the terrified girl out. When the stepmother leaves the room, Su-Mi suspecting something is wrong, enters the bedroom and releases her sister from the closet. Overcome, she comforts Su-Yeon and tells her that she is sorry, that she didnt\u0027 hear Su-Yeon\u0027s pleas for help and that this will never happen again.The father enters and asks Su-Mi why all these bad things have been happening since she returned. Su-Mi says that it\u0027s the stepmother to blame and that his new wife has been attacking Su-Yeon. The father tells her to stop it and screams at her that Su-Yeon is dead. Neither Su-Mi, nor Su-Yeon, is pleased to hear this news.The father makes a phone call and informs the other person that he/she must come to the house tomorrow. The next morning, the stepmother is shown dragging a large sack with something inside it into the house and she starts beating it with a stick. The noise awakens Su-Mi. When she gets up she finds a note from her father saying he will return to the house that afternoon.Su-Mi runs to find Su-Yeon and sees a trail of blood on the floor. Following it leads to the sack the stepmother dragged in earlier. Su-Mi thinks it is Su-Yeon inside, but she can\u0027t get the bag open. She goes to the kitchen to retrieve a knife and when she returns she finds that the sack has been moved to the wardrobe closet. She also finds that her stepmother is behind her ready to throw boiling water on her. A violent fight ensues between the two females and Su-Mi stumbles and is knocked unconscious. Her stepmother drags her to another part of the house and retrieves a garden statue.As Su-Mi regains consciousness, the stepmother asks her what brought them to this point and reminds Su-Mi of a conversation the two once had where the stepmother told her that one day Su-Mi would live to regret something and that no matter how hard Su-Mi would try to forget it, she would never be able to. The stepmother then proceeds to drop the statue on Su-Mi\u0027s head as the father returns.He finds an unconscious Su-Mi as well as the injured stepmother. He attends to the stepmother\u0027s injuries and leaves the room. When the door opens again, someone else enters: the real stepmother. How can this new person be the stepmother when the original stepmother is sitting right there looking at herself?The camera turns 360 degrees to reveal that Su-Mi has been in the house alone with her father the past few days and that the conversations and events she had previously had with Su-Yeon and her stepmother were the result of her schizophrenic mind.The father and real stepmother take Su-Mi back to the hospital and the stepmother returns to the house alone that evening. There she hears an odd noise upstairs in what was once Su-Yeon\u0027s bedroom. When she goes to investigate she encounters a ghost hiding in the wardrobe closet.Flashback scenes reveal that one day some time ago, the father visited the house with the stepmother after what was an apparent marriage, or engagement, to his mistress. His ex-wife, the uncle and the uncle\u0027s wife are also there. An argument results and the sister\u0027s real mother goes into Su-Yeon\u0027s room. When her daughter goes to sleep the mother hangs herself in Su-Yeon\u0027s wardrobe closet. The apparition Su-Mi dreamed of earlier was her hanged mother.In the reveal, Su-Yeon wakens and the door to her closet opens. When she looks inside she finds her mother hanged. She shakes the lifeless body in an attempt to revive it, but instead pulls the wardrobe closet down on top of her. There she suffocates, or is slowly crushed to death, by the weight of her mother and the closet. She desperately strikes at the floor with her hand and calls out for Su-Mi to help her.We also learn that the stepmother having heard something upstairs goes into Su-Yeon\u0027s room. There she discovers the turned over wardrobe, but apparently thinks it is the father\u0027s wife under the closet. She does nothing to help her and quickly leaves the room. She encounters Su-Mi and the two exchange words. The stepmother tells Su-Mi that Su-Mi will one day regret something and that she will not be able to make it go away. Su-Mi brushes past her and leaves the house. She hesitates and thinks about going back inside, but instead she goes for a walk down a pathway not knowing that her life has changed forever and that she won\u0027t be able to ever make the past events go away.","Weighted Degree":"3.0","numvotes":"60965","productioncompany":"B.O.M.

Later, Maria (Lara Wendel), the teenage daughter of Neal\u0027s landlord, is bloodily hacked to death with an ax after stumbling into the killer\u0027s lair.Neal notices that TV interviewer Christiano Berti (John Steiner) appears to have an unusually intense interest in the novelist\u0027s work. At night, Neal and his second assistant Gianni (Christiano Borromeo) watch Berti\u0027s house for suspicious activity. Neal decides to separate from Gianni in order to get a better view. Alone, Gianni watches in horror as an ax-carrying assailant brutally hacks Berti to death. But he is unable to see the murderer\u0027s face. Gianni finds Neal unconscious on the lawn outside the open front door, claiming to have been knocked out from behind.The next day, Giermani\u0027s investigation of the crime scene reveals that Berti was unhealthily obsessed with Neal\u0027s novels, and now that he is dead it is believed that the killings will cease. However, Bullmer, who is having an affair with Jane, is stabbed to death while waiting for his lover in a public square.That evening, Gianni is haunted by the thought that he had seen, but did not recognize, something important at Berti\u0027s house during the night of the interviewer\u0027s murder. He returns to the house and suddenly remembers what was so important: he had heard Berti confessing to his unseen attacker, \"I killed them all, I killed them all!\" Before Gianni can share this important detail with anyone, he is attacked from the back seat of his car and strangled to death by an unseen assailant.Meanwhile, Jane sits at her kitchen table when a figure with an ax leaps through her window, hacking off one of her arms. She spews gallons of blood over the kitchen walls before falling to the floor, the killer continuing to hack at her until she is dead. Neal is revealed to be her killer. Upon learning the details of Berti\u0027s sadistic murder spree, Neal had suddenly been overwhelmed by a forgotten memory involving Neal\u0027s murder of a young woman (Eva Robbins) who had sexually humiliated him when he was a youth in Rhode Island. The memory now constantly torments him and has inflamed his previously repressed lust for blood. Neal has become completely insane. Berti was the killer of Tilde, Maria, and all the other women by razor, but it was Neal who killed Berti, along with Bullmer, Gianni and Jane.When Inspector Altieri arrives at the house a few minutes after Jane\u0027s death, Neal kills her too. Later, Giermani and Anne arrive at the house in the pouring rain, and when Neal sees that he cannot escape, he commits bloody suicide in front of them by slashing his neck with a straight razor. Anne runs outside to her car for a moment. Giermani relaxes and is suddenly murdered by Neal, who had faked his own death. Neal waits inside for Anne to return, but when she opens the door and just at Neal is about to kill her too with the ax, she accidentally knocks over a metal sculpture that impales and kills the demented writer. The horror-stricken Anne stands in the rain and screams over and over again.","Weighted Degree":"3.0","numvotes":"22974","productioncompany":"Sigma Cinematografica Roma","countriesoforigin":"Italy","averagerating":"7.0","originaltitle":"Tenebre","size":"1","genres":"Horror,Mystery,Thriller","storyline":"With Argento\u0027s trademark visual style, linked with one of his more coherent plots, Tenebrae follows a writer who arrives to Rome only to find somebody is using his novels as the inspiration (and, occasionally, the means) of committing murder.

David comments on his own unlimited lifespan compared to his creator\u0027s limited one.In 2104, 11 years after the \u0027Prometheus\u0027 expedition, the colonization ship \u0027Covenant\u0027 is bound for a remote planet, Origae-6, with a crew of 15, two thousand colonists in stasis and 1,140 human embryos aboard. The ship is monitored by Walter, a newer android model that physically resembles David. A stellar burst damages the ship, killing 47 colonists. Walter orders the ship\u0027s computer to wake the crew, which includes several married couples. The ship\u0027s captain, Jake Branson, is burned alive when his stasis pod malfunctions. While repairing the ship, the crew picks up a radio transmission from a nearby, habitable planet. Against the objections of Daniels (Branson\u0027s widow), the new captain, Oram, decides to investigate.As the Covenant remains in orbit, an expedition team descends to the earth-like planet\u0027s surface and tracks the transmission\u0027s signal to a crashed alien ship. Crew members Ledward and Hallett are infected by alien spores. Oram\u0027s wife Karine helps the rapidly-sickening Ledward back to the lander where Maggie, the pilot, quarantines them both inside the med-bay. A small, pale, alien creature (neomorph) bursts from Ledward\u0027s back, killing him, and then kills Karine. Maggie attempts to kill the creature with a shotgun, but triggers an explosion which kills her and destroys the lander. The neomorph escapes while a similar creature bursts from Hallett\u0027s mouth.The neomorphs attack the remaining crew members and kill one. The crew manages to kill a neomorph before David, who survived the \u0027Prometheus\u0027 mission, scares away the other, and leads the crew to a temple in a city full of humanoid (Engineer) corpses. David tells them that upon his and fellow \u0027Prometheus\u0027 survivor Elizabeth Shaw\u0027s arrival at the planet, their ship released a black liquid bio-weapon which annihilated the native population and that Shaw died when the ship crashed in the ensuing chaos. After the crew members tell David of their mission, they attempt to contact the \u0027Covenant\u0027 but are prevented by fierce storms. The surviving neomorph infiltrates the structure and kills crew member Rosenthal. David tries to communicate with the creature, but is horrified when Oram kills it. Oram questions David who reveals that the aliens are a result of his experimenting, with the black liquid (formed from the blood of the first Deacon) and a facehugger egg found in the Engineer city, in an attempt to create a new species even more superior to himself, just as he believes himself superior to the humans that created him, and the humans to be superior to the Engineers. He manipulates Oram into being attacked by an alien facehugger. An alien creature (xenomorph) later erupts from Oram\u0027s chest, killing him.As the others search for Oram and Rosenthal, Walter, who has found Shaw\u0027s dissected corpse, confronts David. David explains that he believes humans are a inferior species and should not be allowed to colonize the galaxy. When Walter disagrees, David disables him, and threatens Daniels. Walter recovers (being a superior model capable of self-repair) and confronts David while Daniels escapes as they fight. A facehugger attacks security chief Lope, but he is later rescued by crew member Cole. The now fully grown Xenomorph appears and kills Cole, while Lope escapes and meets up with Daniels. Pilot Tennessee arrives in another lander to extract Daniels, Lope, and Walter, who claims David has \"expired\".

Many years before the events in The Exorcist, the young Father Merrin (played by Skarsgård, who played the same part in Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist) travels to East Africa. Merrin has taken a sabbatical from the Church and devoted himself to history and archaeology as he struggles with his shattered faith. He is haunted especially by an incident in a small village in occupied Holland during World War II, where he served as parish priest: near the end of the war, a sadistic Nazi SS commander, in retaliation for the murder of a German trooper, forces Merrin to participate in arbitrary executions in order to save a full village from slaughter.After World War II, Merrin is an archaeologist in Cairo, when he is approached by a collector of antiquities who asks him to come to a British excavation in the Turkana region of Kenya. This dig is excavating a Christian Byzantine church built circa 500 A.D. long before Christianity had reached that region of Africa. The collector asks Merrin to recover an ancient relic of a demon before the British can find it. Merrin agrees and travels to the dig site. He is joined by Father Francis, a Vatican scholar who was on his way to do missionary work in East Africa but was diverted by the Vatican to ensure the church is not desecrated. Upon arriving at the site, Merrin meets Major Granville, the British military officer in charge of the dig. Merrin also meets the chief excavator, a brutish man with visible boils on his face. And he meets Sarah, a doctor who spent time in a concentration camp during World War II and is haunted by what happened to her there. Merrin\u0027s translator and guide is Chuma. In addition, Merrin learns that the diggers are disappearing or leaving in droves because the local tribemen fear the church is cursed. Merrin witnesses a digger inexplicably experience a seizure.Merrin visits the dig site. Only the dome is uncovered; the rest of the church is buried beneath the earth. Merrin discovers that the church is in perfect condition, as though it had been buried immediately after its construction were completed. Merrin, Francis, and Chuma enter the church through the dome. They find it is near-pristine condition, but there are two oddities. First, all of the statues of the angels holding weapons are pointing the spears downward, whereas it is conventional for statues of angels to either have no weapons or to point them triumphantly toward heaven. Merrin and Francis deduce the sculptors were trying to depict the angels restraining something that was beneath the church. The second disturbing discovery is that someone has vandalized the church by ripping the enormous crucifix from its place on the altar and suspending it with Christ on the cross in an upside-down position, which is considered a desecration.Merrin is determined to learn more about the archeological dig and asks to consult with the lead archeologist, Monsieur Bession. Sarah tells Merrin that Bession went insane three weeks earlier and was transferred to a mental hospital in Nairobi. Merrin visits Bession\u0027s tent at the dig site and sees dozens of drawings of the same thing, the demon artifact the collector had asked Merrin to find. Merrin then travels to Nairobi to visit Bession. But when he enters Bession\u0027s room, he discovers Bession has carved a swastika on his chest and is speaking through demonic possession in the voice of the sadistic SS commander who tormented Merrin during the war. As Merrin registers these events, Bession slashes his own throat after saying he was \"free.\" Father Gionetti, warden of the asylum, speculates that Bession was not possessed but rather \"touched\" by a demon, which drove him mad and eventually to suicide. Merrin is very skeptical, but before he returns to the dig site, Father Gionetti gives him the volume of Roman rituals to use in exorcism, although Merrin claims he will never use them.Upon returning to the village, strange events continue. A local boy is attacked and killed by hyenas that seem to continuously stalk the dig, night and day. His younger brother, Joseph, enters a fugue state after watching his brother ripped to pieces. Merrin begins to suspect that something evil lies in the church and is infecting the region. There are stories of an epidemic that wiped out an entire village. However, when Merrin, growing suspicious of these rumors, digs up one of the graves of the supposed victims of this plague, he discovers it is empty. Meanwhile, the evil grows, turning people against each other and resulting in violence, atrocities, and more bloodshed.Father Francis reveals to Merrin that the builders of the church never meant it to be recorded in Vatican documents, however, a vague reference to it was recorded, leading to its subsequent discoveries in the 19th and 20th centuries. Francis also reveals that the church stands on the supposed site where Satan fell to earth after the war in heaven, and it was constructed by early Christians in an attempt to purify the evil that resides there.Beneath the church lies the ruins of an even older temple but not a Christian one. Rather, in the ruins under the church, Merrin and his allies find demonic icons, and other signs of evil and Satanism. This land is where he first encounters the demon that calls itself Pazuzu, which he will encounter again in The Exorcist. This is the demon that \"brushed\" Bession (driving him insane) and Joseph (making him ill).At the end of the movie, the dig\u0027s doctor, Sarah, turns out to be the possessed individual and has the demon exorcised from her in the tunnels below the church but dies. Dr. Merrin and Joseph emerge from the church, (once again buried in sand) and history has repeated itself. 50 (and 1500) years ago, everyone at the site was killed by an evil presence from the church, except for one priest.

After her sister gives her her mother\u0027s car, Nell orders her sister, brother-in-law, and nephew to leave. Once she\u0027s alone she finds an ad in the local newspaper asking for volunteers to take part in a study on insomnia at an old New England mansion, which Nell decides to join. Elsewhere we find Dr. Marrow (Liam Neeson) discussing with his assistant Mary over which volunteers he should use for his study, which he explains is actually an experiment on how people react to fear. Once Nell arrives at Hill House, she argues politely with Mr. Dudley the caretaker to let her in. After minutes of arguing she finally enters through the gates of Hill House where at the door she finds Mr. Dudley\u0027s wife Mrs. Dudley. As Nell makes her way to her room, it\u0027s clear that she\u0027s instantly drawn to the house. Moments later Theo (Catherine Zeta-Jones) arrives and gives Nell with an awkward homophobic reaction. After the two get to know each other a little better, they both go downstairs and explore, and find the carousel room, then they return to the main entrance and meet Luke (Owen Wilson) Dr. Marrow, and his two assistants Mary and Todd. Once they get to dinner they discuss insomnia issues and find out more about each other, and learn what they\u0027d be doing for the next few days. After dinner, Dr. Marrow leads his guests to a room to tell everyone the story of Hill House and how Hugh Crain had built it for his wife and wished desperately for children, which all died at birth. After Dr. Marrow tells the story his assistant Mary talks about how she can feel the evil everywhere and that there\u0027s more to the story. As she goes up to examine the piano one of the strings snaps and cuts her, causing her and Todd to leave for the remainder of the movie. As everyone gets ready for bed Dr. Marrow tells Luke about how Hugh Crain\u0027s wife had killed herself, in order to scare Luke. Once upstairs Luke occupies himself with a book and a candy dispenser, while Theo tries to get closer to Nell, and Nell reluctantly asks to go to bed. As Nell and Theo are in bed, Luke decides to wander around, and is met be Dr. Marrow, who decides to talk for a while. As everything calms down for the night Nell is startled by a screaming Theo, in response to a constant mysterious banging on the walls. Nell and Theo cower as Luke rushes to see what the screaming is, although he was unaware of any banging. The next morning everyone tries to talk things out, but Dr. Marrow assures everyone the coldness and noises were all due to the old plumbing. The next night as Nell is asleep the movie encounters it\u0027s first visual samples of paranormal activity, and Nell is encountered by ghostly figures taking forms through the bed sheets and curtains. As Nell and Luke are filling out papers for Dr. Marrows research, Luke confides in Nell that Dr. Marrow must be up to something and that he would get to the bottom of things. Luke soon wanders off talking about Theo leaving Nell alone, where she experiences more paranormal events. Everyone quickly rushes in to see what was wrong and finds Nell scared, and concerned over what was happening in the house. While Dr. Marrow and Luke looked around to see what might have startled Eleanor look comes to a frightening observation that the large portrait of Hugh Crain had been vandalized with blood reading, \"Welcome Home Eleanor.\" Eleanor is appalled at the writing and demands to know who did it, but no one confesses, leaving tension between the characters. The group soon makes their way to the green room where they find a large unstable spiral staircase, and a fountain containing a large statue of Hugh Craine, and some more statues of a women surrounded by 6 children. As another night comes we find Nell sleeping, but she is soon awakened by some more sounds. As she looks around she finds a trail of bloody foot prints leading her to a hidden library. In the library she finds logs of hundreds of children that Hugh Craine must have taken in to his house, finding that many of them had actually died working for Hugh Crain. She goes to tell Theo, but Theo doesn\u0027t believe what Nell tells her, and goes back to bed.  Once Eleanor is alone she starts to brush her hair, but when she stops her hair parts on it\u0027s own, and Eleanor is deeply frightened once more. The next morning Nell finds Dr. Marrow\u0027s studies, and learns what the experiment actually is. She also finds out that he\u0027s interpreting her behavior as delusional. In the statue garden Luke talks to Theo and seems to have also figured out what Dr. Marrow was doing, but when they encounter Nell, she expresses that it\u0027s not Dr. Marrow doing everything to the house, and that it\u0027s indeed ghosts. She then insists that home is where the heart is. When Nell looks up she sees Hugh Crain\u0027s wife hanging, but no one else sees it leading everyone to think even more that Eleanor is mentally unstable and should go home. Nell rushes to the library and finds pictures of Hugh Crain\u0027s wife whispering for her to check the fire place. In the fire place Nell finds a skeleton that comes to life causing Nell to run away, following the voices of children. She tries to go through a door but is punched by a hand that formed from the door and soon disappeared. Eleanor rushes to the rest of the group and concludes that Hugh Crain took children from the town to work at the mills then never let them go. As she tells this to Theo, Luke, and Dr. Marrow, they conclude that she\u0027s going crazy from emotional distress and fear.  As Theo tries talking to Dr. Marrow about her, she finds that they\u0027re in an experiment to study reactions to fear, and becomes furious at what the experiment had done to Nell. Once Nell\u0027s in bed and Theo finishes comforting her and leaves to bring her tea, the walls form the shape of a face, and everything starts falling apart around her. She runs out and looks in the mirror to see Mrs. Crain\u0027s face, and then runs away again to the carousel room. She\u0027s then extremely frightened and runs to the green room. Theo, Luke, and Dr. Marrow go searching for Nell and finally come to the green room to find Nell climbing the spiral stair case. Dr. Marrow goes to save her, but the stairway starts to unhinge, causing Dr. Marrow to desperately and quickly bring Nell to safety. Dr. Marrow goes to the green room to examine and take notes, and is grabbed by the statue of Hugh Crain, which them starts to fountain out blood. He runs to Theo and Luke, to go check on Eleanor. Eleanor\u0027s bed cages her in metal beams, and Theo, Luke, and Dr. Marrow desperately try to get in to help. Once they get in everyone else finally observes the paranormal aspects of Hill House for the first time. As soon as they get Nell out they try to leave, but Hill House makes sure that there\u0027s no way of escaping. Nell then runs back to the house knowing that she\u0027s meant to save the children. Everyone runs in looking for her, so they can leave, and they finally find her. Even after Theo tries to compromise with letting her by letting her live with her, Nell refuses to leave until she saves the children. Luke, Theo, and Dr. Marrow still try to escape now that they can\u0027t leave the house, but can\u0027t find anyway out.

After the incident, Michael is appointed to the St. Agnes parish by the Archbishop Mosely; the parish had been closed after Father Dennis\u0027s unsolved murder.Upon moving into the rectory, Michael is notified by Lieutenant Stern that another priest was murdered there before Father Dennis. Michael finds mention of Millie, a waitress at the Threshold, a local black magic performance art club, in Dennis\u0027s journal; Michael goes to visit her, but she is evasive. She later comes to the parish, claiming to Michael that she saw Father Dennis for confession before his death; during the confession, she admitted to giving her soul to Luke, the owner of the club, whom she claims is the Devil incarnate. Luke visits Michael shortly after, claiming that the Satanic shows put on at the club are only gimmicks, and that he does not actually believe in them; however, he says he\u0027s been recently experiencing supernatural phenomena and begs for Michael\u0027s help. Michael agrees to spend an evening in Luke\u0027s apartment, where he witnesses furious poltergeist activity.When Michael brings the information to Archbishop Mosely, he is informed that Father Dennis was approached by Millie and Luke in an identical manner before being murdered. Father Silva, an elderly blind demonologist, informs Michael he has been \"chosen\" to fight the devil, but Michael dismisses the notion. Millie is incarcerated in a psychiatric ward after attempting to kill Luke, and Michael goes to visit her.

Lieutenant Stern warns Archbishop Mosely that Michael is in danger, suspecting Millie was responsible for the previous murders of the St. Agnes priests; Mosely assures him that Michael is safe. Meanwhile, Millie discovers a book in which she reads of a demon known as the Unholy, which seeks to corrupt and then take pure souls. To prevent herself from being a target, she propositions Michael to take her virginity, which he refuses. Convinced Luke planted the book, Michael confronts him, but Luke denies it.The next day, Michael finds Luke\u0027s eviscerated corpse hanging above the church altar in the pose of the Cross of Saint Peter.

On his way through the village of Oakdale, the Bat notices someone robbing the Oakdale bank. Intrigued, the Bat follows the robber, who leads him to the old Fleming mansion.Inside the Fleming mansion, Cornelia van Gorder [Grayce Hamptom] and her ditzy maid Lizzie Allen [Maude Eburne] are discussing Cornelia\u0027s decision to rent the house for the summer. The big old house is a scary place, and Lizzie doesn\u0027t like the strange sounds, the strange caretaker [Spencer Charters], and the strange stories he tells about seeing ghosts in the house. Add to the fact that the Bat has taken to the country, and Lizzie is terrified of everything and anything. She\u0027s even gone so far as to set a bear trap outside her bedroom window, just in case the Bat decides to pay a vist. When Cornelia\u0027s niece Dale [Una Merkel], who works at the Oakdale Bank, returns home with her boyfriend Brook Bailey[William Bakewell] and tries to pass him off as a gardener, Cornelia is immediately suspicious (Cornelia: Any experience with alopecias? Brook: They dry up if you don\u0027t water them.), but Cornelia hires him anyway, at least until she can find out why Dale has brought him home.A rock suddenly comes crashing through the window. A note on it reads: Get out of the house now while there is still time. Immediately thereafter, Dr Venrees [Gustav von Seyffertitz] drops by to inform Cornelia that the Oakdale bank has been robbed of a half million dollars and that Fleming, Sr, the owner of the mansion, is returning from Europe so Cornelia will have to vacate the house. Then, a heavy painting moves, and a voice from behind warns them to get out of the house. Becoming concerned, Cornelia phones the police. When Detective Anderson [Chester Morris] shows up, Cornelia explains her suspicion that Fleming, Jr [Hugh Huntley] is trying to frighten her out of the house, possibly because he rented it to her while his father was out of the country. Nowthat his father is returning, she thinks he may be trying to frighten her into leaving.Soon everyone begins acting suspiciously. The doctor unlocks the broken window and \"forgets\" to relock it until Cornelia relocks it herself. Alone in the parlor for a few moments, Venrees unlocks the window again. Brook starts going around the house pounding on the walls. Dale phones Fleming Jr and asks him to come over. When he does, he brings a blueprint of the house so that they can locate a hidden room. Before they can find it, he is murdered, and Dale hides a piece torn from the blueprint under a tray. A storm is approaching, and the lightning knocks out the electricity. Someone phones from the garage, but when Det Anderson goes out to check, there is no one there. Detective Jones [Charles Dow Clark] arrives to help with the investigation. Dr Venrees finds the torn piece from the blueprint showing that the hidden room is behind a fireplace, but Det Anderson forces him to hand it over. When Anderson is poring over the blueprint, Venrees clobbers him with a heavy statue and locks his body in a closet. In the lightning flashes, the silhouette of the Bat can be seen peering into the window.It gets even more intriguing. Brook turns out to be a cashier from the bank and the primary suspect in the theft. Fleming Sr is seen walking on the roof when he\u0027s supposed to be out of the country. Dale finds the secret room behind a fireplace and gets locked in, along with the Bat, Mr Fleming Sr, and the money. The Bat shoots Fleming Sr. Dale escapes and leads Inspector Jones, Cornelia, and Dr Venrees to the secret room. Just as the fireplace swings open, Venrees blows out the candle, allowing whomever was in the room to escape. Finally, Inspector Anderson figures it out. Dr Venrees and Fleming Sr robbed the bank together and hid the money in the house. Anderson arrests Venrees and locks him in a closet.A strange man suddenly stumbles into the room. He\u0027s been hit in the head and is suffering from amnesia. He remembers only that he tried to phone from the garage. As they search the secret room for the money and find nothing, Cornelia thinks that she sees someone out on the roof and Anderson goes outside to catch him. Shortly thereafter, the garage is set afire. The amnesic man grabs a gun and orders everyone to be silent. The fire was set to get everyone out of the room, he explains, and the person who set that fire will be back shortly to get the money. They blow out the candles and wait. The Bat enters the house. The amnesic man points the gun at the Bat and orders Inspector Jones to disarm him. Just as they prepare to remove the black hood from the Bat\u0027s face, the Bat creates a distraction by knocking over a chair and escaping...right into the bear trap that Lizzie set so many hours ago.The Bat has been captured. They remove his hood to see that it\u0027s Detective Anderson. The amnesic explains that he is the real Detective Anderson, but he was clobbered in the garage by the Bat, who took his IDs. But the Bat isn\u0027t ready to be captured. While he extols his great intellect, he pulls out a gun he found on the ground and forces everyone to put up their hands. Only Cornelia refuses. I took the bullets out of that gun only ten minutes ago, she says. Everyone jumps on the Bat, and the gun goes off. Cornelia was lying!As the movie closes and the curtain falls on the stage, the Bat drops down from the ceiling. Chester Morris, who played Detective Anderson and the Bat, then addresses the audience. He asks them not to reveal the identity of the Bat to anyone and promises that, if they keep the secret, the Bat will not haunt their homes, steal their money, or frighten their children.

The summary presented here relays the events in the film, but the manner in which they are presented in the film is equally if not more important that the events themselves. This summary should not be considered an adequate substitute for the experience of actually watching the film.Note: Hungarian names in the film and this summary are in \"Eastern order\" (family name first.)Morosgoványi Vendel (Csaba Czene) is a lowly soldier/orderly stationed at a remote Hungarian farmhouse in WWII. The farmhouse is occupied by Lieutenant Balatony Lajoska (Marc Bischoff), his obese wife (Viktória Kiss), and their two teenage daughters. Morosgoványi lives in a crude shed with pigs and spends much time having sexual fantasies about the young girls, typically while spying on them, masturbating or experimenting with his remarkable ability to shoot flames out of the end of his penis.Following the slaughter of one of the hogs, Morosgoványi is propositioned by Mrs. Balatony who pulls Morosgoványi down upon her in the wooden bathtub containing the pig carcass. They have vigorous and loud sex, with Morosgoványi fantasizing that he\u0027s actually screwing the Balatony daughters. Upon finishing, Morosgoványi falls asleep and it is apparent that he was fantasizing the entire encounter while actually copulating with the dead pig.The next morning, Lt. Balatony kicks open the door to the shed, and shoots the slowly awakening Morosgoványi in the back of the head, blowing his brains out. Mrs Balatony subsequently gives birth to a very large, fat baby. The lieutenant examines the boy lying in the wooden bathtub and discovers a pig-like tail on him. Without speaking a word, he retrieves a pair of pliers from the shed, calmly snips off the tail, and slaps the boy on the rump.Thirty years later Balatony Kálmán (Trócsányi Gergõ) still has his tail stump, and has grown into a hefty professional speed eater. In an stadium full of cheering fans, Kálmán and his friend Miszlényi Béla (Koppány Zoltán) compete for Hungary against the Russian team, shoveling huge spoonfuls of offal and other disgusting material into their mouths in an attempt to finish their enormous helpings first.Narrowly losing the initial round, Kálmán is berated by his uncle/coach for being distracted by Aczél Gizi (Stanczel Adél), the women\u0027s speed-eating champion who is present in the audience and cheering for both him and Béla, who also fancies Gizi. During the break between rounds, Kálmán and Béla trade jibes over Gizi while casually regurgitating the meal they have just gorged themselves.After wiping their mouths off, the competitors face up to the next round - chosen by the Russians to be a giant blob of gelatin/fat with various disgusting animal parts congealed within. Still distracted by Gizi, Kálmán suffers an attack of lock-jaw, and - unable to get the spoon out of his mouth - collapses backwards.Béla visits Kálmán, who is recovering in hospital with an enormous scar on his chest, Gizi by his side. Béla and Gizi blatantly flirt yet Kálmán appears not to mind, instead savoring the drop of sweat that falls onto his face from Gizi\u0027s hairy armpit. At his subsequent wedding to Gizi, Kálmán sings a folorn song about unrequited love while Béla convinces Gizi to \"elope\" with him. The \"elopement\" consists of taking her outside and drunkenly screwing her from behind while she looks through the window at her husband.We next see a sports factory where fat young boys are apprenticed to a government program to develop world-class speed eaters. Seated at an enormous trough of semolina, the stern coach blankets the trough with a few scoops of cocoa powder before starting the boys off on their training. In an office above the factory floor Kálmán is in training and is frustrated. Just at the time when he is attempting his professional comeback from injury, the International Olympic Committee has refused to recognize sport eating. While vomiting into a recycling machine, he complains to his coach.Gizi discovers that she is pregnant. Her and Kálmán\u0027s joy is obvious, but they are concerned by the Communist rules which require pregnant women to be reassigned to a particular factory which would negatively affect her calorie intake and thus her competitiveness in sport eating. They bribe the obstetrician, who gives them a choice between \"cyst\" and \"myeoma\" as a diagnosis which will apparently enable special treatment.While on holidays at the seaside, the famous Kálmán and Gizi are playfully suggesting names for their child when they are \"invited\" aboard the yacht of a visiting Russian dignitary. Before boarding, a flunky explains that they are expected to give a demonstration of their sport. Specifically, this involves eating 45kg of caviar (with a few bacon hocks thrown in) within 20 minutes. Gizi clearly struggles, perhaps concerned for the baby. Beneath decks, Kálmán supports her by reminding her of her previous glories. Back upstairs they are expected to attend dinner, but Gizi is so sick that she passes out face-first onto her plate.Another thirty years pass. We see Balatony Lajoska (Marc Bischoff), - painfully thin - at work at his taxidermy business. Cluttered throughout with various animals, the workshop shows a man who is dedicated to his work. Lajoska leaves his shop and travels to the grocery store where he purchases a huge volume of butter and chocolate. He is obviously smitten by the checkout girl, who ignores his creepy attempts at making eye contact. Lajoska visits the apartment of his father Kálmán, who is now a ridiculously immense naked blob of shapeless flesh. The chocolate bars are for Kálmán, who boasts that by leaving the silver wrappers on he can increase his intake from 400 to 570 per hour. The butter is for Kálmán\u0027s super-sized cats, who lurk menacingly behind iron bars in their porcelain-tiled lair.Kálmán clearly despises his son, partly because of his profession (\"carcass stuffer\") but mostly because he is so skinny. Lajoska endures a barrage of insults from his father as he cleans the house and the cage. Kálmán is too fat to move and even needs his son to change his bedpan for him. Kálmán\u0027s life revolves around his enormous cats and his television, which he swears at while watching his former wife Gizi coaching an American champion speed eater.Back at his taxidermy shop, Lajoska is asked by a dapper businessman for his help regarding a special project. \"Domestic or wild?\" The businessman smirks and admits \"Domestic\". Peering into the customer\u0027s paper bag, Lajoska nods and accepts the work.Again at the grocery store, the same shopping list and the same uncomfortable stare at the checkout. At Kálmán\u0027s apartment, his father needles Lajoska with continued insults. When he calls his son \"cyst\", Lajoska angrily confronts him about how ungrateful he has been. The two get into a terrible argument, throwing chocolate bars at each other. Lajoska storms out suddenly, telling his father he can die for all he cares.Lajoska throws himself into his work. We see extreme closeups of his work under a magnifying class as he prepares various animals for mounting. Back at the grocery store a few days later, Lajoska is buying a small amount of butter and chocolate; the fight with his father was probably the latest in a long series. The female clerk is gone, replaced by a man.At Kálmán\u0027s apartment, Lajoska realizes something is wrong. Having left the cage open after their terrible fight, the cats have attacked and killed Kálmán, chewing a hole into his enormous gut. A string of entrails leads back into the cage where a pair of satisfied cats sit licking their chops.Lajoska embalms his father, stuffing straw into his stomach through the holes the cats gnawed. We next see him strapped standing into an elaborate contraption in the basement of his workshop. Pumps slowly sigh, liquid flows through clear tubes, syringes dive into flesh, and trays of scalpels and other vicious medical instruments move past on articulated arms.With the aid of mirrors, clamps and levers, Lajoska begins the exacting and painstaking work of eviscerating himself. There is no doubt as to his intentions and progress; we are shown in exacting detail scalpels slicing flesh, opening body cavities, removing organs. Lajoska guts himself in front of us.With trembling hands, obviously exhausted from his work, Lajoska finally sews up his own sweating torso. Completing the taxidermy, he pushes a button and we see a razor-sharp blade crank slowly around to the front his neck. After a few calm breaths, the blade is released and via a spring it whips around behind, decapitating Lajoska. A moment later, a saw falls on his right arm, blood gushing as it\u0027s severed just below the shoulder.We cut to the businessman returning to the shop. Unable to locate the proprietor, he goes into the back room and discovers, in the same paper bag, the completed work he requested of Lajoska: a glass globe containing a tiny human fetus. Satisfied, he is about to leave a stack of cash on the bench, when he changes his mind. Venturing further into the shop, he eventually makes his way down to the basement where he discovers Lajoska.We cut immediately to the same businessman at an avant-garde art gallery, lauding the artistic genius of Balatony Lajoska. The glitterati are drinking champagne and eating hors dourves from a porcelain pig.On display in the gallery are two exhibits: firstly: Balatony Kálmán, resplendent in golden tights with a snarl of cat fur protruding from the hole in his magnificent belly, but primarily Balatony Lajoska - minus his head and right arm, standing casually naked with a stitched torso, looking more like a classical Greek statue than a man who mutilated himself.","Weighted Degree":"9.0","numvotes":"17441","productioncompany":"Amour Fou Vienna","countriesoforigin":"Hungary, Austria, France","averagerating":"6.8","originaltitle":"Taxidermia","size":"3","genres":"Comedy,Drama,Horror","storyline":"Three generations of men, including a pervert that constantly seeks for new kinds of satisfaction, an obese speed eater and a passionate embalmer.","Clustering Coefficient":"0.0","genre":"Comedy","Number of triangles":"0"},"color":"rgb(137,86,49)","size":57.04917907714844},{"label":"Jane","x":-52.46868133544922,"y":-348.3241271972656,"id":"tt12885326","attributes":{"notes":"Folk horror","year":"2020","Weighted Degree":"6.0","numvotes":"15","productioncompany":"20th Digital Studio","countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"5.2","originaltitle":"Jane","size":"3","genres":"Horror,Short","storyline":"A forensic sculptor breathes life into a skull.","Clustering Coefficient":"0.0","genre":"Short","Number of triangles":"0"},"color":"rgb(55,74,52)","size":38.68852615356445},{"label":"Blood Feast","x":-760.4357299804688,"y":1124.4532470703125,"id":"tt0056875","attributes":{"year":"1963","runtimeminutes":"67","synopsis":"In a suburban Miami house, a young woman arrives home and turns on her portable radio which broadcasts news of a murder, one of several within a few days. The woman turns off the radio and begins to take a bath. Suddenly, a gray-haired, wild-eyed man appears in the bathroom and brutally stabs the woman in her left eye, killing her. The man hacks off her left leg with a machete and leaves with it.The next day at the police station, Detective Pete Thornton reviews the latest murder to a homicidal maniac killing nearly five women now, and there are no clues. His chief superior advises him to continue pursuing the case.At Fuad Ramses\u0027 Catering shop, Dorothy Freemont, a wealthy socialite, arrives where she arranges for Fuad to cater a party for her daughter Suzette. Fuad agrees to cater the party for Suzette and tells Mrs. Freemont that what he\u0027s preparing hasn\u0027t been prepared for over 5,000 years. Mrs. Freemont wants the catering done in two weeks and Fuad tells her that it will be enough time to get the last of his ingredients. After Mrs. Freemont leaves, Fuad ventures to the back storage room where he has a large gold statue of the \"mother of veiled darkness\", the goddess Ishtar. Fuad is repairing a blood rite for her in order for the goddesses resurrection. The solution that Fuad mixes in a huge vat contains the parts of the dead women.That evening, two teenagers, Tony and Marcy, make out on a nearby beach when Fuad attacks them, subduing Tony and slicing off the top of Marcy\u0027s head \u0026 removing her brain to serve as the latest ingredient. Pete Thornton arrives on the scene with the police chief where, after not getting much from the distraught Tony, interrogate Marcy\u0027s mother who can only tell Pete that her daughter belonged to a book club.At a local motel, Fuad is staking out the place when he sees a drunken sailor drop his wife off at her room before taking off. Fuad knocks on the woman\u0027s front door to the room and attacks her when she opens the door. Fuad rips the woman\u0027s tongue out of her mouth as another ingredient to his \u0027blood feast\u0027. Pete continues to investigate this latest killing and also discovers that the latest murder victim also belonged to a book club too.Pete attends his weekly Egyptian studies lecture at the local university with his girlfriend, who happens to be Suzette. The lecturer tells them about the Cult of Ishtar, and describes how virginal women were sacrificed on a altar as a blood offering to the Egyptian goddess. When the lecture is over, Pete takes Suzette out for a evening drive where she becomes worried about these events and of a serial killer loose in the area. Their date is interrupted by their car radio which the announcer says that another victim has been found near death. Pete drops Suzette home and races to the hospital where the police chief is there and informs him that the maniac has struck again and hacked off the face of another woman named Janet Blake. Pete questions Janet in her hospital bed, in which the woman, with a bandaged face, tells the detectives that the man who attacked her was old with gray hair, with wild eyes, wearing a funny-looking dark suite, and he said something which sounded like \"Etar\". Janet Blake then dies, while Pete can\u0027t shake the feeling why that word sounds familiar.Fuad receives a letter from Trudy requesting a copy of the book \u0027Ancient Weird Religious Rites\u0027, of which Ramses is the author. Fuad calls Trudy\u0027s home phone number and learns that she\u0027s staying with Suzette. That afternoon, Fuad stakes out the Freemont residence and kidnaps Trudy from the grounds and takes her to his store. He whips her savagely and collects her blood, the last ingredient of his concoction for Ishtar.With Trudy missing, Mrs. Freemont insists that the party continue. Pete calls Suzette to inform her that he will be late in arriving. Meanwhile, Fuad arrives with his food that he bakes at his store. Elsewhere, Pete calls upon the college lecturer and gets more information about the Cult of Ishtar and about the book that Fuad Ramses had wrote and figures out that Fuad is the killer since all the victims were women who personally called upon him to send them copies of his book. Pete and the police race over to Ramses\u0027 store and find Trudy\u0027s mutilated body in the back of the store. Pete tries to call Suzette to warn her, but at coincidentally the same time, Fuad cuts the phone line to the Freemont house.At the Freemont party, Fuad is ready with the food, but he first asks Suzette to come into the kitchen to help him. He has Suzette lie on a counter, which he makes his altar, and say a prayer to Ishtar, as he prepares to stab her in the chest with a butcher knife as a final offering to his goddess. Because she won\u0027t take him seriously, Ramses\u0027 attempt to sacrifice her is delayed. Dorothy Freemont interrupts Fuad just as he\u0027s about to stab Suzette, and Fuad escapes just as the police arrive.Pete and the rest of the police chase Fuad through a nearby garbage dump where Fuad attempts to escape by climbing into the back of a departing garbage truck. The truck\u0027s compact blades suddenly activate and Fuad is crushed to death. The police stop the truck and see there\u0027s not much left of Fuad Ramses as Pete puts it, \"he died a fitting end, just like the garbage he was.\"","Weighted Degree":"4.0","numvotes":"6606","productioncompany":"Friedman-Lewis Productions","countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"5.0","originaltitle":"Blood Feast","size":"2","genres":"Horror Only","storyline":"An Egyptian caterer busies himself collecting body parts from young maidens to bring Ishtar, an ancient goddess of good and evil, back to life.

His girlfriend Marta (actress not identified) urges him to hurry and take her to the office. He remarks that the strange old lady is seen watching him again.As they get into the car, the old lady is no longer seated in the park. He notices her walking away and points this out to Marta, who suggests he just ask the woman what she wants. He drives to and lets her off at her office. She suggests that they get married one day. He replies that he will think about it and leaves.He is seen putting suitcases in the car and driving off. Talking to Lorna (Margherita Guzzinati) who is sketching on a sketch pad, he tells her that his girlfriend has kicked him out and is looking for a place to stay for a couple of weeks. He notices the drawing, which is of a little boy standing by an old woman. When he looks up, he sees the old woman who was talking to a young boy. He approaches the boy as the woman crosses the street to buy a paper. The boy tells him he doesnt know the woman. She gets into a taxi and drives away. The newsstand vendor tells him the woman was looking to see if an ad was in the paper, on the back page. Sergio gets a paper and begins looking. Having found the ad, he tears off the page and disposes of the rest of the paper. He tells Lorna he will be back in an hour.Having arrived at the address in the ad, he buzzes the door at an old castle. The door opens and he enters. Inside, he sees what a lavish old house was once. He goes upstairs and calls out. A womans voice tells him to continue one more flight and then to the left.Seeing her at the top of the stairs, he remarks that she looks familiar. She asks if he is disappointed and invites him up, calling him by name. She introduces herself as Consuelo Lorente (Sarah Ferrati), a widow. He asks why she has been following him and points out the ad, which describes him. She asks if it is not a coincidence and that he is the only one who qualifies to work on her late husbands journals. He insinuates that there are no journals and she is making it up. She tells him to follow her to the library. She will prove that she is no liar.They go down a passageway and take a small elevator to the library, which is old and disorganized. She shows him her husbands writings, reading a page from a book named Spain 1924. He is mildly interested in erotic writing but still says he is not the one to do the job. She tells him there is another man there, but that she is unable to dismiss him for mysterious reasons. As he questions her further, she goes and takes a drink from a teacup. He notices through the bookshelves that she becomes unstable. He rushes to seat her in a nearby chair. Dialing the phone, he calls a friend to come, saying she may have poisoned herself. She tells him she is all right and not to tell anyone. A series of shadows cross the face of Consuelo.He looks around the library, hearing a guitar being played. A woman, (Rosanna Schiaffino), appears holding a guitar. She introduces herself as Aura, daughter of Consuelo. He explains that her mother has fainted and seems to have taken a drink of potion from a cup which he hands her. She replies that it must be difficult for her mother who was formerly a beauty queen. She asks him to help get her to bed. He tells her that he has phoned his friend who is a doctor and will be here soon. As he turns to go help, she drops the cup, breaking it. He notices. She leaves the room.He carries Consuelo and puts her on the bed. Aura attends to her and removes her jewelry. Consuelo stirs slightly. Aura tells him she will recover soon.She shows him the chapel, telling him that her father was the Mexican Ambassador to Rome for many years. When he remarks of the similarities between her and her mother, she tells him that they are nothing alike. She asks what else he would like to see, to which he replies her room. She says maybe later.They gaze through an iron grating at Consuelo and Aura asks if he really thought she meant to seduce him. He is surprised and asks how she knew that. She doesn\u0027t answer. He asks if she is amused by that to which she replies yes. She shows him to the garden.She answers that she knows he was summoned by the ad. He asks what reasons she knows why he should take the job. Good food and peace and tranquility, she says. She tells him that her door is never locked and he tells her that the most important thing is for her to be like her mother was when she was young. They go into the greenhouse, where she tells him her mother grows a plant she brought with her from Mexico in a tea which she drinks. He kisses her and asks if she likes it. She agrees.There is a catfight and she asks him to chase them away. He picks up some clods and throws them at the cats. At least one cat is seen exiting the window. She tells him she cooks with herbs that she grows in the greenhouse. She asks him to fetch her some aloe vera which is good for healing. He goes to find it and when he looks back, she is gone. He goes to leave and notices a dead cat which has been strangled with a string around its neck. He goes calling for Aura.Going back upstairs in the house, he finds Consuelo and asks about her. She claims she was going to connect the electricity so that she would hear the bell when the doctor arrived. He tells her about the dead cat that was tortured before it died. She makes a reference to some hoodlums who come over the wall to torment the cats. She asks for his arm to help her to her room.Consuelo asks Sergio how he likes her daughter. He says he likes her but that she is different from most girls. She confesses that she is jealous of Aura and is afraid some common man will take her away from her. He helps her lie on a couch and places a pillow behind her. She says she will wait for the doctor. She believes her daughter imagines that she lives in a drug-induced fantasy world. She tells him that there are no secrets between her and her daughter and that Aura is waiting for him in the library.When he is unable to find Aura in the library, he calls Marta on the phone, telling her he will be home soon. As he does this, he notices a mummified body in a glass coffin. Stunned, he hangs up and goes to look. Aura speaks from a nearby rocking chair, telling him it is her father who is embalmed here and that he is the author of the journals in the library. He asks and is told that Consuelo comes and stares at the body for hours.She retrieves a book and begins talking about the author who took a lover of age 13. He begins to caress her about the shoulders. She asks why he is attempting to undress her and he mentions making love. She asks if he would like music and puts on a record. She tells him to follow all her instructions. As the tropical jazz music plays, she removes his coat with her mouth. He goes to unzip her dress and she tells him to do it with his mouth. He removes her dress by mouth and gazes upon her beauty. She approaches him as the music tempo gets faster. They kiss and she tells him that they can stop playing now. They begin embracing until a noise is heard in the room.They look up and see Fabrizio (Gian Maria Volonté) placing some books on a shelf, having just awakened. Surprised to see her, Fabrizio approaches and welcomes her back. She suggests that Sergio has tried to attack her and that she resisted. Fabrizio turns to question Sergio, who denies an attack. Fabrizio looks him over for signs of resistance but finds none. Asking why he is there, Fabrizio hears that Sergio has answered an ad for a librarian. Sergio tells Fabrizio that he is still the incumbent librarian and that no one has fired him. He questions Aura as to why he is there. She claims that he has been rejected by her and her mother although initially was accepted. She tells Sergio to go, reassuring Fabrizio that he will remain. Sergio asks what the ending to the comedy is. He receives a slap on the face from Aura.  Good ending.  he says.Fabrizio questions Sergio about whether Consuelo rejected him or he chose not to take the job. Sergio tells him Consuelo changed her mind. When Fabrizio asks what if anything the old woman said about him, Sergio replies  nothing good.  Sergio turns to leave.Hearing a strange noise, Sergio finds Consuelo conducting a ritual with a crucifix. She stops when she sees him, telling him that the doctor friend just left. She convinced the doctor that there was a misunderstanding.Sergio calls out the window to his friend Marco (Vittorio Venturoli) who is leaving. As he tells the old woman he is leaving, she insists he say goodbye to Aura. He approaches Aura in the next room and sits by her. Consuelo tells him that they had hoped he would prove to be a good friend and that she lied to him earlier about the dead cat. It is Fabrizio who tortured the cat, she claims. She wants Sergio to do Auras eyebrows. He is handed the pencil and begins tracing her eyebrows. She tells him to go.Outside, Sergio is told by his friend that the old lady said he had left. He asks if the doctor thinks she is crazy and is told that most likely she takes drugs. Offering to take Sergio to lunch, the doctor drives off after being told that Sergio will remain.Sergio questions the owner of a nearby antique shop about the purchases bought from the old lady. She claims the money is in the millions and that Consuelo is at least twenty years older than she. Sergio disbelieves that, pointing out that she has a young daughter. He is told Consuelo has no daughter and that most of the money went towards facial reconstruction. Sergio returns to the house.He sees Fabrizio praying for strength in the chapel. Sitting down, he offers an amen to the prayer. Fabrizio questions why he has returned, then urges Sergio to serve as a confessor in the chapels confessional. Fabrizio confesses to living in hell and loving it. He tells of a false body near him each night to which he is addicted and wants absolution. When Sergio tells him he cannot absolve him, Fabrizio is upset and tells Sergio he should leave. Sergio also recommends that Fabrizio leave, which he says he cannot do. He asks that they make a pact that if he can convince Aura that Sergio will leave.Aura comes in and tells Fabrizio it is time for the bath. He points out that Sergio has come back and tells her to welcome him with a kiss. She approaches Sergio as if to kiss him but whispers  thank you. Aura prepares the bath and Fabrizio tells Sergio that he was destitute when he first came but that the old lady gave him everything he has now. He tells Aura to pour a drink for Sergio, which she does. She goes back into the bathroom and changes into a robe as Sergio watches through the door. He tells Fabrizio that it is time for him to leave them alone. Fabrizio says it is time for his bath and goes in. Sergio approaches Aura and they begin kissing on the bed. They talk about Fabrizio and she admits she is afraid of him. They begin more passionate kissing and Aura pushes him away, saying that Fabrizio is watching. He is shown looking through the glass at them. She says to Sergio that it is impossible tonight and goes into the bathroom. Sergio feels something under the pillow and finds a small gun. He examines it and places it back. Hearing them kissing, he opens the door and is told by Fabrizio that it is impossible tonight. Aura is seen sitting on the bed. Sergio leaves.Fabrizio and Aura are seen fencing (they are wearing no masks). He gives her some instructions. They look over and see Sergio watching them. Fabrizio gives her an epée and they resume. He strikes her epée down and teases her with the tip of the blade. Sergio rushes over to her aid, but is rebuffed by Fabrizio, who tells him to stop being a hero. She excuses herself and leaves. Sergio tells Fabrizio that he is tormenting her and keeping her as a slave. Fabrizio answers that she likes him, which is disputed by Sergio. Telling Fabrizio that he will take the job, Sergio is told that the job belongs to Fabrizio. Sergio says he will ask Consuelo.They enter Consuelos quarters and Fabrizio tells her that Aura is pleased with him. She asks Sergio what he wants and he begins to tell her that he wants the job, but is interrupted by Fabrizio, who insists that she tell Sergio he is not wanted or needed. She replies that the decision is hers to make. Asking if Sergio approves of the pay and agrees to live in the palace, she hires him and tells him to remove Fabrizio. He tells Fabrizio to pack his bags and leave. This infuriates Fabrizio, who turns to see Aura looking in. He goes after her. Consuelo tells Sergio to go after him.Seeing the elevator going up, Sergio takes the stairs and ends up in the library, calling for Aura. The lights go out and he looks around, finding a sabré which has been stabbed into the mummified corpse. Muffled screams are heard. As Sergio runs through the darkened library, he sees Fabrizio grab Aura and run out of the room. He chases after them. Hearing them nearby, he pushes away books from a shelf and sees them embracing. Aura reaches out to Sergio, who fights with Fabrizio. In the struggle Fabrizio is killed. When Sergio informs the women he will have to report this accidental death to the police, Consuelo tells him no and to dispose of the body. He insists he will tell but is told that they will testify that he came in and violently attacked them. Sergio realizes they are working together and that he has been used to kill someone they no longer wanted around. Stunned, he offers disbelief. Both women insist that he must do as he is told.Sergio is told to put the body in the trunk of Consuelos car because his is too small. Then he is given a roll of heavy tape and told to do as he was instructed so that the body will not be identifiable. Sergio takes the body to nearby railroad tracks and tapes the arms to the rails, positioning the head so the train will run over it. He hides in the bushes and checks his watch as he waits for the train. A man is seen crossing the tracks with a bicycle. The train roars through and Sergio returns to the palazzo.He tells Aura that everything went as planned and that he is leaving. He will tell no one about this. She professes that she wants him. He tries to leave but is irresistibly drawn to her. Consuelo tells him that now that he has proven his worth, she is able to reveal that Aura is not her daughter.The three are seen eating with Sergio watching. Aura and Consuelo have almost identical hand movements. They rise and look at Sergio. Consuelo says she is cold and for Aura to go and see if a window is open. As she leaves, strange music is heard. Consuelo comments on the music and Sergio calls for Aura. Consuelo pours another cup of the potion tea and drinks it as Sergio comes back into the room. He questions why she drinks it if it is harmful. She begins chanting, saying that it is life. She begins ritual dancing and speaking Italian. He asks where she has sent Aura. The dancing continues and Consuelo tells him to look in the dark. Aura is seen emerging from the shadows and begins a sensual dance. Both women are seen dancing as Sergio watches. Aura begins writhing on her knees until finally Sergio cries out for it to stop. The music stops but Consuelo is not seen. Aura approaches him and they go to Fabrizios bedroom.Sergio tells her he would prefer to go to her bedroom, but she insists that this is her bedroom and that they will be together forever here. Sergio turns and sees Consuelo watching. He angrily tells her to get her ugly face away and stop watching. Aura, undressed and sitting in bed, turns out the light. He tries to turn it back on, but she insists she prefers the dark. She lies down and begins moaning, clutching the bed frame.He wakes the next morning alone in bed. Consuelo tells him that Aura is not there, but that she told her last night how happy she was. She asks Sergio if he is happy and he agrees. She tells him that she is afraid that something will happen to interfere with that happiness. She brings his breakfast on a tray and clothes for him to wear. She tells him that the newspaper reports nothing bad. He is told to begin work in the library that day.Sergio goes outside as the city bells are ringing. Glancing down, he sees Consuelo dragging a cat by a rope around its neck. He goes into the fencing room and finds Aura, kissing her and telling her he missed waking up with her. He says he wants to take her away and leave Consuelo behind. She insists that this is her home and that he will not be able to persuade her otherwise. Saying she misses Fabrizio and his fencing, she tries to get Sergio to fence with her. He refuses and takes away her foil. She draws two epées and gives one to him. He kicks it away and takes hers away from her. They argue over the mention of Fabrizios name, which he never wants to hear again. He slaps her a few times, asking to know the truth. She says she will go away, leaving him alone with Consuelo. He locks the door and demands to know who she really is. She asks for him to let her out. He throws away the key. She runs from door to door but they are all locked. Exhausted, she sinks to the floor and begins twitching. He asks what is wrong. She contorts on the bed and Sergio calls for Consuelo. She tells him to leave her alone and retreats into the closet behind clothes. He calls to her and pulls aside the clothes. Consuelo is revealed. She tells him that she transforms herself into Aura for his pleasure and to give her time.Unbelieving, he runs around the house, calling for Aura. Unable to find her, he goes into the greenhouse and sits to wait. Outside a raging thunderstorm begins. He hears the womans voice calling him. He turns and sees Aura in the distance. She approaches him. Consuelo is also seen, warning him not to imprison Aura again. She must be free to come and go. She bids him come back to the house. Aura says he will be able to see and touch her because the witch wills it to be so.Later he is seen watching a woman hanging clothes on a clothesline and singing. He goes to his desk in the library but pulls his knees up into the chair. Next he is seen praying for strength just as Fabrizio did. Consuelo hears him and tells him he is pathetic. She asks why he doesnt leave and get another job. He answers that he is happy here. He asks if she remembers the last lines her husband wrote. She tells him to return the book to the library. He quotes lines from the journal which tells of his wife having reincarnated someone. Rushing into her room, he tells her the last words of her husband were that he was afraid of her and wanted to know what she had become. What happened to him, Sergio asks her? She tells him that he committed suicide. She asks him to zip her dress and to take some things to the antique store to sell. He begs her to bring back Aura whom he has not seen for several months. He pours a cup of the tea and tries to force her to drink it. She reminds him that only she can bring Aura back and that he should not make her angry.As he is carrying a statue to the antique dealer, Marta pulls up in a car and calls to him. Selling the statue, he is seen collecting the money and going back to the palazzo. Marta tries to question him, but he seems disinterested and wonders how she found him. She says she was just on her way to the antique dealer and saw him. He goes back into the house where Consuelo is leaving. Giving her the money, she remarks how his former friend seems to want him. She says she doesnt know when she will be back and leaves. Marta tries to prevent him from closing the door but is unable.Sulking in the library, he hears Auras laughter and goes to investigate. She is seen lying on a couch. She gets up and tells him it is because of the new man. Sergio looks and sees a new young man (Ivan Rossamov) who has answered a newspaper ad.

Shortly after defeating the evil entity known as Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard), the Losers Club - Bill Denbrough (Jaeden Martell), Ben Hanscom (Jeremy Ray Taylor), Beverly Marsh (Sophia Lillis), Richie Tozier (Finn Wolfhard), Eddie Kaspbrak (Jack Dylan Grazer), Stanley Uris (Wyatt Olef), and Mike Hanlon (Chosen Jacobs) - gather as Bev tells the boys about the vision she saw of all of them as adults when she faced Pennywise. The Losers make a blood pact to return to Derry in the event that they must face IT once more.27 years later in 2016, a gay couple - Adrian Mellon (Xavier Dolan) and Don Hagarty (Taylor Frey) - are enjoying a night out at the carnival when they are harassed by homophobic thugs. Even as they walk away from the carnival, the thugs follow them and start to viciously assault them. They throw Adrian over the bridge and flee into the night. Adrian almost drowns until he is pulled out of the water... except the one who pulled him out was Pennywise. Don watches in horror as the monster clown grabs Adrian and takes a huge bite out of his chest. Mike (now played by Isiah Mustafa) overhears a report of the incident over a police scanner, and when he arrives at the scene, he discovers the message \"COME HOME\" written in blood on the side of the bridge. Mike knows that IT has returned.We catch up with the other Losers in adulthood. Bill (now played by James McAvoy) is married to Audra (Jess Weixler) and has found success as an author/screenwriter, but he is frequently told that his endings are not good. Eddie (now played by James Ransone) is a risk assessor who is married to a woman, Myra (Mollie Atkinson), who is just as controlling as his own mother. Ben (now played by Jay Ryan) has slimmed down and is a successful architect, though he lives alone. Richie (now played by Bill Hader) is a stand-up comedian. Stanley (now played by Andy Bean) is a partner in an accounting firm. Bev (now played by Jessica Chastain) is a fashion designer, married to the abusive Tom Rogan (Will Beinbrink). Mike calls everyone, and they do not immediately recognize his voice until he mentions he is from Derry. Everybody becomes slightly unnerved by the phone call, and Mike beckons them to return to Derry. Bev tells Tom that she will be returning to Derry to visit friends, but he is paranoid and thinks she is lying to him and is cheating on him since he heard Mike\u0027s name. Tom starts to hit Bev until she fights back and runs away from their home. The other guys start to make their way back to Derry. The only one who doesn\u0027t go is Stanley, as he commits suicide by slitting his wrists in the tub rather than facing the nightmare from his childhood again.A flashback shows that psychotic bully Henry Bowers (Nicholas Hamilton) survived being pushed down the well by Mike and had washed out of the sewers. When he returned home, police arrested him after they came across the body of Henry\u0027s father and deduced that he murdered him. Today, Henry (now played by Teach Grant) is in a mental institution and has become even more insane. He is visited by Pennywise in the form of a zombified Patrick Hockstetter (Owen Teague), who presents Henry with his old knife.The Losers meet at the Jade of the Orient restaurant and catch up after a long absence. They joke and reminisce, but also note Stanley\u0027s absence. They start to split fortune cookies, only to each get single word fortunes that they realize form a full message. Bev\u0027s fortune reads \"Stanley\", and put together, the fortunes read \"Guess Stanley Could Not Cut It\". The Losers know that Pennywise has found them. The fortune cookies then start to crack open and reveal hideous little spider-like creatures. The Losers bash at them on the table, which only makes them look crazy when others see them attacking a table. Outside the restaurant, Bev calls Stanley\u0027s wife. Before she can say what happened, Bev knows that Stanley was found in a bathtub, and the other guys figure what happened to him.Everyone gathers at the hotel where they are staying, and Mike confesses that this is the real reason he summoned everyone back to Derry. They ask Bev how she knew how Stanley died, and she says she has seen how they all die, as she was the only one who saw the Deadlights when Pennywise captured her. Bill goes back to Mike\u0027s house, where Mike drugs Bill\u0027s water to cause him to experience a trippy vision. Mike explains that in all the time he has stayed in Derry, he has studied the history of IT and learned from a Native American tribe of the Ritual of Chud, which can be performed to destroy IT once and for all. He produces a ritualistic piece of pottery with a depiction of the ritual. They bring it back to the other Losers, and Mike explains that they need to gather artifacts from their childhood and place it in the pottery so that they can destroy Pennywise.Somewhere else in Derry, we see a little girl named Victoria (Ryan Kiera Armstrong) at a football game with her mom. Victoria is lured away by a firefly, and she follows it under the bleachers until she meets Pennywise. He uses the same manipulative trick on her to make her think he is playful, and he appeals to her sympathy when he cries about not having friends, as Victoria is made fun of for a birthmark on her cheek. Pennywise promises to make it go away, only to end up devouring Victoria.The Losers go to an old clubhouse that Ben built for them over the summer they all became friends. There, they find an artifact for Stanley, which is a shower cap. A flashback shows them as kids with Stanley asking if they will all remain friends as adults. His friends assured him that they would be.The gang splits up as they head back to their homes in Derry. Bev goes to her old home and meets the elderly Mrs. Kersh (Joan Gregson). She invites Bev inside for tea and cookies as Bev looks around. She finds an old pack of cigarettes, as well as the poem that Ben wrote for her, although she still thinks it was written by Bill. As Bev sits with Mrs. Kersh, the old woman displays unusual behavior. Bev notices what looks like rotted flesh on Mrs. Kersh\u0027s chest. She mentions to Bev that her father joined the circus. Bev sees what looks like a human Pennywise in an old picture. Mrs. Kersh then asks Bev if she is \"daddy\u0027s little girl,\" as her father had called her. The old woman is then revealed to be Pennywise as she takes on a grotesque and monstrous form that chases Bev out. Before Bev gets away, she sees Pennywise in his human form as \"Bob Gray\", who wears his clown makeup and scratches the red lines on his face to taunt Bev.Richie goes to an old arcade he went to as a kid where he picks up a token as his artifact. In a flashback, he is seen playing a game with Henry\u0027s cousin, and the bully teases Richie for being a \"fairy\". Adult Richie is then found and tormented by Pennywise, who claims to know his \"dirty little secret.\" He takes on the form of a Paul Bunyan statue and tries to attack Richie, but he gets away in time.Bill goes to an antique shop and sees that his old bike is on sale. He asks the shop owner (played by none other than Stephen King) if he can buy the bike. The owner knows of Bill\u0027s work, but agrees that his endings suck. Bill gets the bike and rides around his old street, passing the sewer where Georgie (Jackson Robert Scott) was taken. Pennywise taunts Bill with an apparition of Georgie calling to him from the sewers. Bill is almost lured in by the monster clown. As he rides away, he sees a kid named Dean (Luke Roessler), whom the gang had seen at the restaurant because he is a fan of Richie\u0027s stand-up. Dean has also seen Pennywise lately after Bill had mentioned it. He firmly orders Dean to get himself and his family out of Derry as soon as possible.Ben gets an old yearbook page, in which Bev was the only one to write for him. He is haunted by a flashback to his childhood where Pennywise took on Bev\u0027s form to ridicule Ben for his weight, as Pennywise knew that Ben loved Bev, and he still harbors feelings for her to this day. Her form\u0027s head took fire as Ben hid in a locker, only for Pennywise to be in there with him.Eddie goes to the pharmacy where he would pick up his medications. Creepy Mr. Keene (Joe Bostick) and Gretta (Juno Rinaldi) still work there. Eddie gets an inhaler before he is haunted by Pennywise in the form of his mother being attacked by the Leper (Javier Botet).Henry kills a guard and escapes the institution. He finds the Losers and attacks Eddie by stabbing him in the cheek. He manages to pull the knife out and stab Henry in the chest, albeit non-fatally, and he runs to his friends for help. However, Henry gets away again before he is caught.In another Pennywise haunting, Bill sees the message \"The fun is just beginning\" written, which is what Dean said to Richie at the restaurant, itself a line from Richie\u0027s stand-up. Bill knows that Pennywise is referring to Dean, and he goes to a carnival to try and save the boy after learning he will be there. Bill follows Dean into a hall of mirrors, but Dean just thinks Bill is a crazy weirdo. The two are then found by Pennywise, who bares his long tongue and razor-sharp teeth. Bill desperately tries to kick the glass out to save Dean, but Pennywise breaks through first and brutally attacks the boy, blocking Bill\u0027s view. Bill can only watch in horror as he fails to save the boy.Mike is in the library where Henry finds him and attacks him. Not long after, Richie comes and kills Henry by stabbing him in the back of the head. This causes Richie to puke.Bill reunites with his friends and vows to kill IT himself. His friends gather their artifacts and they join him at the Neibolt House to face off the evil entity for the last time. While there, they make it into Pennywise\u0027s lair and use the pottery to begin the ritual. The Losers throw in their artifacts, being Bev\u0027s poem, Ben\u0027s yearbook page, Richie\u0027s token, Eddie\u0027s inhaler, the boat that Bill helped make with Georgie, and a rock that Mike recovered from their rock war with the Bowers gang. The Deadlights appear and sink into the pottery with the artifacts, but just when it seems that things worked, out rises a red balloon that produces Pennywise. He faces the Losers again in his true form, as a monstrous spider that still carries his clown face, and he states how he has waited so long to see them again. Mike then reveals that the ritual never worked, and the tribe that attempted it on Pennywise got killed themselves. He splits the Losers up with more nightmare visions, including one of Stanley\u0027s severed head as a spider.Eddie and Richie find themselves in a similar scenario to when they were kids as Pennywise places three doors with \"Scary\", \"Very Scary\", and \"Not Scary At All\" for them to walk through. They see the severed half of Betty Ripsom\u0027s body, as well as a small Pomeranian that morphs into a monster. Meanwhile, Ben and Bev are trapped and split from each other, and Pennywise tries to kill Ben by having him sink into the earth while Bev is trapped in an illusion of a bathroom stall where he is harassed by the forms of Mr. Keene, Gretta, Henry, and her own father. Bev fights back against the visions and manages to pull Ben out from sinking, and she realizes he is the one who wrote her the poem as he had recited it as he was almost dying.Bill is trapped in what looks like his childhood basement. He sees his young self talking to Georgie, as the image of the little boy blames Bill for lying on the day that he died, as Bill had pretended to be sick so he wouldn\u0027t go out to play with Georgie in the rain. This had haunted Bill for years, and Pennywise knew he blamed himself for it. Young Bill goes to his adult self with a nail gun, but Adult Bill forgives himself and shoots the apparition instead.The Losers get close enough to fight Pennywise, with Eddie managing to muster up the courage to strike Pennywise himself. As he runs to Richie, however, Pennywise impales Eddie with one of his talons. The Losers try to seek a way out of there, and they figure that since Pennywise is a spider, he can make himself small to try and go after them. They then quickly realize that the only way to make him small enough to defeat him is to force him to believe he is small. They begin to yell at Pennywise and call out all of his otherwise harmless forms before he starts to shrink and shrivel into a powerless shell of his former self. This allows the Losers to pull his heart out of his chest and crush it, destroying him for good. The lair begins to crumble and collapse around them. Richie tries to get Eddie out, but he is already dead. The Losers escape the house and watch as it collapses on itself.The remaining five head to the quarry where they all swam as children. They think about Eddie and how he would have hated it since it\u0027s so dirty. Richie then starts to cry for his fallen friend, and the others console him. As they continue to swim, Ben and Bev share a kiss. As they later walk home, they see their reflections on a window and see their childhood selves, including Eddie and Stanley. One last flashback shows the group as kids riding their bikes home.Later on, Bill has gone back to work with writing, and he feels his endings are getting better. He speaks on the phone to Mike, who is thinking about finally seeing the rest of the world. They tell one another that they love each other, and Mike mentions a letter that all the Losers have been getting. Bill finds his letter and sees that it\u0027s from Stanley, written before his suicide. We hear his voice reading the letter over a small montage of the other Losers in the present. Ben and Bev are now in a relationship, while Richie goes to a bridge where he carved his and Eddie\u0027s initials, revealing that he was in love with him. Stanley\u0027s letter states that he knew he could never be brave enough to face Pennywise again, so he removed himself from the equation to give his friends a chance to honor him, which would give them the strength to fight IT. He turned out to be right.The film concludes with Mike driving away and finally leaving Derry.","Weighted Degree":"3.0","numvotes":"245218","productioncompany":"New Line Cinema","countriesoforigin":"United States, Canada","averagerating":"6.5","originaltitle":"It Chapter Two","size":"1","genres":"Drama,Fantasy,Horror","storyline":"Defeated by members of the Losers\u0027 Club, the evil clown Pennywise returns 27 years later to terrorize the town of Derry, Maine, once again.

In the next room Clair Crosby (Leela Savasta) is writing a Christmas card to her half-sister, Leigh (Kristen Cloke). Suddenly she hears something from her closet. She goes over to the closet door and looks inside. Nothing but clothes. She goes back to her card and sees that her fountain pen is missing. Suddenly a figure wraps a bag around her head. In the struggle, the figure stabs the pen into her eye.At a mental institution not far away, Billy Lenz (Robert Mann) is being served his Christmas dinner. He is locked away, rocking back and fourth in his rocking chair, safely in his cell that is decorated with Christmas lights. The orderly serving the food gets a scare from a volunteer dressed as Santa who is looking for the children\u0027s ward. Security guard J. Bailey (Ron Selmour) makes jokes to the orderly about Billy trying to escape every year. The orderly and Santa walk away, leaving the security guard alone in the hall. Billy opens the small window on his cell and places a present wrapped in newspaper on the ledge for the security guard. The security guard opens it to find nothing that interesting, except on the newspaper is written \"I\u0027ll be home for Christmas.\" The security guard looks into the cell to find it empty and Billy\u0027s chair rocking back and fourth. He quickly opens the cell and goes inside, to find a hole in the wall. He takes his flashlight and looks into the hole, as Billy comes from under the bed and stabs him in the neck with a candy cane. Billy leaves the cell and kills the man dressed as Santa. He steals his outfit, stuffs his body in a bag, and leaves the institution, dumping the bag in the dumpster with the man\u0027s hand sticking out from the bag.Outside of the sorority house, Kelli Presley (Katie Cassidy) and her boyfriend Kyle Autry (Oliver Hudson) are talking in his car. She tells him that she is going to spend Christmas with her roommates but that she will make it up to him. He is disappointed because this is their first Christmas together. She kisses him goodbye and goes inside the house. As she does her fellow sorority sister Megan Helms (Jessica Harmon) calls Kyle on his cell phone. Meanwhile, Megan is in her room, watching an old home made porn movie that features her and Kyle. Kyle hangs up the phone. Kelli goes inside and greets everyone, including Melissa Kitt (Michelle Trachtenberg), her best friend. Heather Fitzgerald (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), Dana Mathis (Lacey Chabert), Lauren Hannon and Ms. MacHenry (Andrea Martin), the house mother who loves all of the girls and accepts their flaws.They have a \"secret Santa\" gift giving thing going and Ms. Mac wants to know who got Billy. According to her, Billy (Cainan Wiebe) killed his family here. When Billy was born, he has a liver disorder that makes his skin yellow. His father loves him regardless but his mother is disappointed and wants nothing to do with him. They live in the house that is now the sorority house. As Billy gets a bit older he is treated even worse by his mother, who has become an alcoholic. On Christmas, when he is five, his mother tells him Santa was shot down by the Russians. His father, however, tells him he has a present for him hidden in a stow-away space in Billy\u0027s closet. Billy goes into his room, which will become Eve\u0027s in the present day, and finds a telescope, making him briefly very happy. However his mother and father are not getting along very well, and his mom is having an affair. Moments after finding the telescope, Billy hears arguing and looks under the door to witness his father with a bag over his head and his head being bashed in with a hammer. Billy runs back to his room as his mother and her lover take the body outside and begin to bury it in the crawl space under the house. Billy is watching this and is discovered. His mother chases him into the attic and locks him in there.All of the girls are horrified by this story but Ms. Mac assures them it is all true. Heather says she was the one who drew Billy\u0027s name for secret Santa but she thought it was wrong to buy him a gift because he was a murderer and it was offensive to the birth of Jesus to make a mockery of gift giving. Heather starts to go upstairs to her room but runs into Eve Agnew (Kathleen Kole). Eve has been upstairs the whole time and is leaving to go visit her family. She gives Heather her secret Santa gift, a crystal statue of a unicorn. Heather is less than impressed and bids Eve farewell. Eve goes towards the door but Ms. Mac tells her she has a present for her. Before she can find it, Eve leaves, obviously disappointed by Heather\u0027s reaction.Kelli and Lauren go upstairs to tell Clair and Megan they are going to open the presents. Clair obviously doesn\u0027t answer. Lauren pounds on the door and says she is going to steal her presents if she doesn\u0027t get down here. Laughing, Kelli does this on Megan\u0027s door. Megan tells them to go away and she doesn\u0027t want to open presents. They leave and Megan hears a snow globe tune playing in the attic. She goes into the attic and asks if someone is playing a joke. She gets more then she bargained for when she finds Clair\u0027s body by the window in a rocking chair. Someone comes from behind and smashes the snow globe into her head. She falls onto the ground as a bag is put over her head. She fights back, but the figure rips out one of her eyes with their bare hand!The home phone rings, Melissa answers it and puts it on loud-speaker. The caller is making all sorts of weird noises. Lauren teases him, and the caller threatens to kill Lauren before hanging up. Heather says someone is obviously sick in the head and doesn\u0027t need to be provoked by Lauren. Melissa checks the caller ID and is surprised to see it\u0027s coming from Megan\u0027s cell. They assure themselves it\u0027s just a joke.They open their presents, with Ms. Mac getting some lingerie as a gag gift. Everyone laughs and Kelli goes back upstairs to check on the girls. Kyle suddenly pops out of Megan\u0027s room. Kelli screams and the other girls rush upstairs. Kyle apologizes and says he wanted to surprise her. Ms. Mac asks if Megan is in her room and Kyle says he doesn\u0027t know. Lauren asks him how he could have just been in her room and not know if she is in there. He explains that it\u0027s really dark in there. He makes a joke about Billy getting her. He then tells everyone another story about Billy\u0027s past.Billy was kept in the attic for many years. His mother and stepfather lived happily without him. Everything was wonderful except his mom couldn\u0027t get pregnant by his step-father, and was sexually frustrated by his inability to maintain an erection. On Christmas, when Billy was twelve, she crept into the attic and had sex with him, her own son! Nine months later she gave birth to a baby girl named Agnes (Dean Friss). She loves Agnes, and uses the occasion to further reject Billy, looking up to the attic where Billy is kept, and saying in reference to Agnes, \"She\u0027s my family now.\" Variants of this line are used repeatedly in the rest of the movie. As Agnes grew older, Billy became jealous. One Christmas, Agnes got a doll for a present. A jealous Billy releases a tantrum and breaks the attic door open and rushes to the living room, attacking Agnes and pulling out one of her eyes, stabbing his stepfather in the face and beating his mom to death with a dough roller. When the police arrive on the scene, they find him eating a cookie made from his mother\u0027s flesh. Agnes was put into an orphanage and no one knows where she is today.The girls are freaked out by the story. Kelli goes inside Megan\u0027s room and finds the porn video on the computer. She breaks down and Kyle tells her it was from a long time ago. Kelli screams for him to leave the house and he becomes enraged, calling the women \"spoilt bitches.\" Ms. Mac goes off on him about treating Kelli like that, pushing him towards the stairs. As Kyle leaves, a figure is standing by the tree looking at the presents. Ms. Mac asks who the person is. Clair\u0027s half-sister, Leigh tells the girls that Claire never called her, telling her she was ready to be picked up and she is worried. Dana says she even had no idea Clair had a sister. Leigh explains they are only half-sisters and are trying to get to know each other.Suddenly the power goes out in the house. Dana says the circuit breaker is under the house and she will go turn it on. She goes outside and smokes, dropping her cigarette into a hole on the porch. She hears someone underneath it. Taking her flashlight she opens the door to the crawl space and looks inside. Suddenly someone grabs her, pulling her in. The two struggle as the figure grabs a gardening tool and stabs Dana in the head. Lauren is beyond drunk now, having been drinking booze the whole night. Melissa tells her she smells and needs to shower. As she showers, someone watches from a broken tile in the floor. After the shower, Lauren goes to bed.Everyone starts asking where the other girls are, since Clair, Megan and Dana have disappeared. Kelli questions what is taking Dana so long, and is even more startled when someone calls from Dana\u0027s cell number and hangs up. The rest of the girls go outside to look for Dana. Heather and Leigh find Eve\u0027s car still parked outside. They open the car door and scream as Eve\u0027s severed head rolls out. The girls scream and run back into the house, locking the door behind them. Kelli calls the police but because of the snow it may take over two hours for them to arrive. Ms. Mac tells everyone that they can pile into her car and try to find help. Kelli says that they won\u0027t get far and that they need to stick together. Heather says she wants to leave, and Ms. Mac tells the girls that they can stay and she will go with Heather to find help. The two go outside and get in the car. Ms. Mac gets out of the car to scrape the ice off of the windshield. As she begins to scrape Billy\u0027s yellow eye comes into view inside the car. Ms. Mac gasps as he kills Heather, her blood spraying all over the windshield. Ms. Mac falls against the garage door, causing an icicle to fall from above which impales her head.Leigh notices that Ms. Mac hasn\u0027t left yet. She decides to go see what\u0027s going on. Kelli decides to go out with her, leaving Melissa and a sleeping Lauren behind. As they leave the house a figure grabs Heather\u0027s unicorn statue and walks down the hall. In the garage, Leigh slips on Ms. Mac\u0027s blood and screams. Upon hearing this Melissa rushes towards the stairs. A figure grabs wraps a bag over her head, slamming her into a wall. She rips the bag off and rushes through the house and into her room. She grabs a stick and hits the figure with it. Melissa opens a window and is going to climb out but the figure throws an ice-skate at her, cutting off the back of her head.Kelli and Leigh rush inside and call for Melissa. There is no answer and they go to Lauren\u0027s room, closing the door behind them. But someone is on the other side of the door and kicks it open. It\u0027s Kyle. Leigh attacks him and he throws her against Lauren\u0027s bed, causing the covers fall off of Lauren, who is very much dead with her eyes gouged out! Everyone screams and Kyle insists he isn\u0027t the killer. Kelli calls Lauren\u0027s cell phone and hears it ringing in the attic. She explains that the killer might be in the attic with her phone. Kyle opens the attic door and is pulled inside. Kelli and Leigh try to get into the attic but the door is slams shut. Kyle fights back as a bag is put over his head. Kelli breaks the door open and witnesses Kyle being stabbed with the unicorn statue, then one of his eyes being ripped out and eaten! Leigh attacks the figure and is thrown across the attic, discovering her half-sisters body still in the rocking chair. The figure attacks Kelli and Leigh tries to help but is knocked into a hole in the floor. A bag is put over Kelli\u0027s head but she grabs a fork and stabs the figure in the eye. She gets up and sees the figure has a glass eye. It\u0027s Agnes. Kelli tells Agnes everything is okay and she doesn\u0027t have to do this. She tells him her brother isn\u0027t here, he is still locked away. Agnes tells her that she doesn\u0027t have a brother, only a father. Billy comes from behind and lights a candle.Agnes attacks Kelli but is knocked into another hole in the floor that pins her between the walls! Billy pushes Kelli into the same hole, accidentally knocking over the candle. Kelli has grabbed onto a string of Christmas light attached to a small tree, trying to keep from falling completely in. She screams for help as Agnes starts to crawl up the hole. Leigh comes to her rescue, smashing open the wall. Agnes grabs Leigh\u0027s head but she manages to fight her off. Leigh runs through the house and smashes out another wall, finally reaching the spot where Kelli is trapped. Billy is climbing into the hole and Agnes is crawling up it! Leigh grabs Kelli and pulls her to safety as the Christmas tree catches fire (along with the rest of the attic) and falls into the hole, burning Agnes and Billy. The two survivors rush outside.At the hospital Kelli is going to have some tests done to make sure she is okay. Leigh has a present in her hand from Clair. She tells Kelli she wants to open it now because she won\u0027t be able to open it in front of her family. She says that she is glad she got to know Clair before all of this happened. She opens the present and finds a watch engraved with \"Family Forever.\" She starts to cry as a nurse comes in and tells Kelli they need her for some x-rays.Some time later Leigh goes back to Kelli room to see if she is back from the x-rays. A body with blonde hair lays in the bed, but as she approaches the person turns over to reveal Agnes. Leigh screams as Agnes grabs her by the throat and snaps her neck.Kelli comes back into the room and feels something is wrong. She finds Leigh\u0027s new watch. She sees blood on the ceiling above her and starts to leave the room, but Agnes grabs her from behind the curtain and starts to strangle her. Kelli grabs a defibrillator paddle and shocks Agnes in the head with it, killing her. This is the ending for the UK version. The US version continues from here when Billy comes down from the ceiling, as Kelli rushes from the room. She grabs some crutches that are in the hall and starts to beat him with it. She turns to run, thinking he is unconscious but he grabs her foot, causing her to fall over a medical cart. Billy grabs a scalpel from the pile of medical supplies now on the floor and takes chase. Kelli rushes to the stairs as Billy comes from behind, slashing her with the scalpel. She grabs him and throws him over the stairway, causing him to fall on top of the Christmas tree below, impaling him. His intestines spew out, he is very much dead, and Kelli is left to look on in shock as the credits start...","Weighted Degree":"2.0","numvotes":"27084","productioncompany":"Dimension Films","countriesoforigin":"Canada, United States","averagerating":"4.6","originaltitle":"Black Christmas","size":"1","genres":"Horror Only","storyline":"In the 70\u0027s, the boy Billy is born with yellow skin due to a liver disease and his dysfunctional mother rejects him.

There he meets Joan (Shirley Anne Field), a 20-year-old girl, who lures him into a mugging staged by her biker brother King (Oliver Reed) and his gang. Wells is beaten up and robbed.Later Joan approaches Wells on his small boat. He is prepared to forgive and forget, she implies that he asked for it after trying to pick her up. At that moment they are threatened by King and his gang. Wells sets off on his boat and calls on Joan to join him which she does, defying her over-protective (and rather incestious) brother.After drifting out to sea, Joan decides to go back and confront King, who has previously locked her into a cupboard when she has come close to other men. King and his gang keep a watch-out for them.At night Wells and Joan return to a quiet part of the mainland and make love in a cliff top house surrounded by curious sculptures. Caught up and surrounded by the gang, the couple escape into a nearby military base where guards and dogs are soon in pursuit of them all.The house was rented by sculptress Freya Neilson (Viveca Lindfors) whose lover, Bernard (Alexander Knox), is a scientist who runs the base. He will not discuss his work, warning her that he \"might be condemning her to death\".Wells and Joan make their way down the cliff face. King goes after them. There they discover a network of caves and bunkers occupied by a small group of young boys and girls, aged about 11. Although well-dressed, cared-for and educated, it is clear that they do not know much about the outside world. The children\u0027s skin is also cold at the touch.In fact the children are confined to the bunker which is the underground part of the military base. The premises, which double as a schoolroom and living quarters, are filled with surveillance cameras. Access to the children is limited though they are occasionally visited by men in radiation suits. Bernard gives them lessons via a TV monitor, but dismisses some of their more searching questions, saying that they will learn the answers \"when the time comes\".The children do not even know much about where they are. One of them actually believes that they are in a spaceship and are to populate a distant planet.The children have a small hideout in a connecting cave where they keep pictures and mementoes of people they think are their parents. They believe that it is a safe and secret place but Bernard and his associates are well aware of it. Bernard, who is, in his own way, genuinely fond of the children, has allowed them this degree of privacy in spite of objections by the head of security Major Holland (Walter Gotell).Time passes and Wells, Joan and King feel increasingly unwell, but Wells and Joan have promised to help the children escape and pressure King into helping them. The children keep them fed by ably smuggling food pass the surveillance cameras into the hideout.Since security has been unable to find the intruders, Bernard tells the children via the TV monitor that he knows their secret and asks that they give up the grown-ups that they are hiding there. He reminds them of a rabbit they once acquired as a pet but which later died and warns them that the same might happen to their would-be rescuers. The children rebel and destroy the cameras.Men in radiation suits then enter the premises but are overpowered and even killed by Wells and King. Using a Geiger counter, Wells discovers that it is in fact the children themselves who are radioactive. Nevertheless he agrees to break them out. They escape the bunker and face the world, the Sun and flowers for the first time.But before they can take it all in, they are rounded up and, kicking and screaming, are taken back to the bunker by other men in radiation suits. Freya Neilson, the sculptress, witnesses the events.King drives off in a sports car accompanied by Henry (Kit Williams), one of the children. Weakened by the radioactivity, King orders Henry out of the car saying that he is \"poison\". Henry is then grabbed by pursuers and forcibly taken back to the bunker in a helicopter.Chased by another helicopter, King crashes his car into a river. Joan and Wells are allowed to leave on his boat, but the sickness catches up with them and the boat goes round and round in the sea monitored by a military helicopter, which will destroy the boat once its occupants are dead.Bernard\u0027s only real regret about the whole affair is that \"his\" children now know for sure that they are \"freaks\" and prisoners and will be more difficult to control. He explains to Neilson that they were radioactive from birth. The plan is to release them \"when the time comes\", i.e. the inevitable nuclear war. Their bodies will resist the nuclear fallout and the human race will continue. Now that Neilson knows his secret, Bernard kills her. (In the 1950s and early 60s, the threat of nuclear war was very real, a matter of \"when\" not \"if\", and culminated in the Cuban Missile Crisis.)The film ends with the children desperately and vainly calling for help from their cliff side prison.","Weighted Degree":"6.0","numvotes":"3447","productioncompany":"Hammer Films","countriesoforigin":"United Kingdom","averagerating":"6.6","originaltitle":"The Damned","size":"2","genres":"Drama,Fantasy,Horror","storyline":"The middle-aged American Simon Wells sails in his boat to Weymouth and stumbles with the twenty year-old Joan on the street.

Alexandra is a sculptress and single mother, Jane is a newly divorced music teacher incapable of having children, and Sukie is an extremely fertile woman with six children and also works as a journalist at the \"Eastwick Word\". Besides an everlasting friendship, these three women share similar misfortunes of being abandoned by their husbands. Not knowing of themselves as being Witches, the women unwittingly form a coven of which consists of weekly get-togethers, during which they drink, play cards, and share their fantasies about ideal men.The day after one such meeting, a mysterious man arrives in the town and immediately stirs up trouble by buying the city\u0027s landmark property, the Lennox mansion. The arrival of this enigmatic stranger causes fascination among the townfolks, all except local townswoman Felicia Alden, the Christian wife of newspaper editor Clyde Alden. Clyde is the boss of Sukie (who Felicia does not like). Although Felicia is not a Witch, she is somehow able to sense that this man, whose name is easily forgotten by everyone, is up to no good. One night, at Jane\u0027s music recital, the man appears and makes a spectacle of himself, which leads to more gossip among the people. After the recital Jane receives flowers and a personal note from the man, signed with the initial \"D\". This then sparks Sukie\u0027s memory, finally revealing the man\u0027s name to be Daryl Van Horne. At the very moment of Sukie remembering his name, her beaded necklace inexplicably breaks and falls to the floor, causing Felicia, who had mocked Daryl\u0027s name, to trip down a large staircase, breaking her leg.Daryl begins to seduce the women one by one, beginning with self-assured Alexandra, who is at first appalled by his arrogance and bravado, but then allows him into her heart. He moves on to Jane, who is seen as being very shy and reserved. Jane explains to Daryl that the home he lives in was once said to be an area where people were burned alive after being accused of witchcraft. Daryl then encourages Jane to stop living a life of doubt and learn to enjoy herself. She takes his advice and begins to act and live recklessly. The next day Daryl invites all three women over to the mansion, which allows him to finally turn his attentions on Sukie. A jealous rivalry emerges between the women, leading to a supernatural game of tennis, where the tennis ball begins to behave oddly--floating, stopping in mid-air--in response to their mood. This shared telekinesis reveals to the women their magical abilities. The women decide to forgo competition and share Daryl, and have the most fun they\u0027ve ever had in their entire lives.Their frequent presence at Daryl\u0027s mansion leads to gossip and rumors spread by Felicia. Alex, Sukie, and Jane become outcasts of the city; the women of Eastwick acknowledge the trio with nasty looks and snotty comments. The Witches begin to have second thoughts on whether or not they should continue to see each other, which then motivates Daryl into causing the girls to unknowingly cast a spell on Felicia, causing her to projectile vomit cherry stones. Felicia is finally killed by husband, who beats her with a fire poker after being horrified when seeing his wife so incredibly ill. Terrified of the dangerous effects of their relationship with Daryl, they agree among each other to never see Daryl or each other for a long period of time. This upsets Daryl, causing him to use his powers against the girls, bringing their worst fears to life. Alex awakens into a bed of snakes, Jane begins to lose her youth transforming into a old woman, and Sukie is forced to feel intense pain. The women reconcile with Daryl in order to get in his good graces again.Realizing that the only way to rid Daryl from their lives is by using Witchcraft against him, the girls trick Daryl into going to town for a while as they practice a banishing spell to make him go away forever. Sukie goes to Daryl\u0027s office and takes a spell book he kept locked in a glass chest. Jane gathered some of Daryl\u0027s personal belongings such as hair, clothing, and pictures of him. Alex created a Voodoo doll out of wax that resembled Daryl. Meanwhile, as Daryl was in town shopping for the girls, he began to feel painful sharp aches in his body from the girls sticking pins and needles into the doll. Daryl becomes infuriated with the girls betrayal, and as he made his way home, Daryl\u0027s devilish figure was beginning to reveal itself more and more. Now terrified of what Daryl is capable of doing to them, the girls throw the Voodoo into the flames of a fire then causing Daryl to disappear.Eighteen months later, Alex, Jane, and Sukie are now the mothers of Daryl\u0027s sons.

The narrator, Dr. John Markway (Richard Johnson) tells us, \"An evil old house, the kind some people call haunted is like an undiscovered country waiting to be explored. Hill House had stood for 90 years and might stand for 90 more. Silence lay steadily against the wood and stone of Hill House. Whatever walked there walked alone.\" Title and credits follow, then narration continues, \"Scandal, murder, insanity, suicide: The history of Hill House was ideal. It had everything I wanted...\" The house was built in New England by a man named Hugh Crain for his wife and young daughter. A horse and carriage accident took the life of the first Mrs. Crain (an uncredited Pamela Buckley) before she even saw the house. Hugh Crain (an uncredited Howard Lang) and young daughter, Abigail (an uncredited Janet Mansell) said a few words over the body, but Hugh was left an embittered man. Crain married again, and the second Mrs. Crain (an uncredited Freda Knorr) also died, falling down the main staircase. Hugh Crain left Abigail with a nurse (an uncredited Susan Richards) and went to England where he died in a drowning accident. Abigail kept the same nursery room her entire life. By the time she was eighty (an uncredited Amy Dalby) she was a bedridden invalid. Her nurse-companion (an uncredited Rosemary Dorken) was a local girl and, it is with this young companion the evil reputation of Hill House really begins. The old lady died while calling for help. The companion was trysting on the verandah with a farm hand. The companion inherited Hill House and occupied it for many years, but eventually hanged herself. The house then passed to a distant relative, named Mrs. Sanderson (Fay Compton). Markway visits Mrs. Sanderson where he convinces her to let him use the house for psychic research. He explains, \"I shall occupy the house with a group of carefully selected assistants...I must have specially qualified help to take notes and document any evidence of the supernatural I may find.\" Eldridge Harper (Ronald Adam), Mrs. Sanderson\u0027s lawyer, voices his concern about publicity seekers and the propriety of having women in the house. Harper suggests to Mrs. Sanderson that her nephew, Luke, joins the doctor at Hill House, as he expects to inherit the property. Mrs. Sanderson asks point blank, \"Exactly what do you and your assistants expect to find at Hill House?\" Markway replies, \"Maybe only a few loose floorboards, and maybe, I only say maybe, the key to another world.\"Dr. Markway, taking a leave of absence from his university professorship, finalizes his list of assistants. Only two end up accepting, Eleanor Lance and Theodora (no last name). Eleanor Lance (Julie Harris) is living with her sister. She is nearly broke and weary after looking after her invalid mother non-stop for eleven years. Mother is now dead, and she fights with her sister over just about everything. She begs to use the car, which is after all, half hers. Her brother-in-law, Bud Fredericks (an uncredited Paul Maxwell) tries to act as mediator between Eleanor and his wife, Carrie (Diane Clare). He is sympathetic to Eleanor\u0027s plight, but their daughter, Dora (an uncredited Verina Greenlaw) takes her cues from her mother, and taunts her Aunt Eleanor. On the vacation plan, Bud sides with Eleanor, \"I think you should have a vacation, Nell.\" Carrie objects, but Eleanor is not to be deterred and she shows her family how she reacts when pushed to her breaking point. She is normally quiet and meek, but when pushed is loud and assertive. Nell decides to take the car and confronts the garage attendant (an uncredited Claude Jones) for the keys. She departs Boston along U.S. 50 and Route 238 to Hill House. We hear Nell thinking and she reveals she will never return to live with her sister. In fact, most of what we learn of Eleanor is hearing her thoughts.Eleanor arrives at Hill House. The property is surrounded by a stone wall and the entrance by a tall, iron spiked, gate. She honks the car horn, and Mr. Dudley (Valentine Dyall), the cranky caretaker, finally deigns to respond. \"What do you want?\" he asks. Eleanor explains that she is expected. After an impertinent exchange with Eleanor, Dudley finally opens the gate and allows her to enter the property. Eleanor is the first to arrive and drives up to the house. Along the way she stops to look at it. It is a huge, stone mansion with lots of detail on the façade and steep, pitched roofs. Her first reaction is that the house is vile and it is staring at her. She carries her suitcase to the front door and is greeted by Mrs. Dudley (Rosalie Crutchley). Mrs. Dudley reluctantly allows Eleanor to come inside, but does not utter a word to her. The inside of the house is dark and over-decorated, and Eleanor is escorted to her room. Mrs. Dudley explains the house rules about meals, and that she won\u0027t stay in the house after dark. Eleanor checks out the bathroom and hears the next guest arrive. Theodora (Claire Bloom) introduces herself. Eleanor explains they share a bathroom. Mrs. Dudley repeats her meal and departure rules by rote, but Theo and Nell ignore her. Theodora is a bit strange to Eleanor (Theo clearly flirts with Eleanor throughout the film) Theodora\u0027s sexual orientation is only hinted at, and we later learn she has the gift of ESP. Theo and Nell explore the house, but they get lost. Both women feel a chill, and Nell observes, \"The house, it\u0027s alive.\" Theo seems to feel that the house wants Nell. Dr. Markway appears and explains he left the door opened, but it closed itself. Markway gives the women a tour of part of the house, starting with the main purple parlor, which they will use as an operations center. He explains that all the doors were set slightly off-center, so they close themselves. Despite studying plans to the house, even Markway gets lost on his way to the dining room. They hear a noise, but it turns out to be Luke Sanderson (Russ Tamblyn) mixing a pitcher of martinis as he enters the dining room. Luke serves each person a martini. They sit down for dinner and discuss their duties and responsibilities. Markway explains that Theo was accepted because of her remarkable power of ESP and Eleanor had a poltergeist experience as a child, \"showers of stone fell on your house for three days when you were 10 years old.\" Luke is a non-believer. His interest is to financially exploit Hill House, after he inherits it, of course.That evening, in the parlor, Markway works on his notes while Eleanor sits quietly on the couch. Theo and Luke play gin rummy at the game table. Theo\u0027s ability to see cards allows her to win five games in a row, much to Luke annoyance. She demands he pay her the $12 he owes, but he refuses because she cheated. The four decide to turn in for the night and continue the tour the next morning. Markway gives them papers and asks that they complete them with their observations each night.Sometime during the night, Eleanor wakes, and still in a near dream state, thinks she hears her mother knocking on the wall. Theo hears it from the next room also and calls to Nell. The two women are frightened and both hear the pounding noise. It comes and goes, but louder each time. They finally hear a woman shrieking and laughing that fades away. When Nell opens the door she sees Luke and Markway in the hall outside. The men explain they were chasing a dog and followed it outside, but they did not hear the loud noises the women heard. Markway concludes that something is trying to separate the men and women.The next morning, Markway and Nell join for breakfast. Nell is starting to develop romantic feelings for John Markway, unaware that he is married. She tells him that she spent eleven years taking care of her invalid mother. Nell also voices her fear that she will be turned out of Hill House with no where to go. Markway tells Nell how he came to do psychic research, and that his family disapproves. Theo joins the pair and warns the doctor, \"If anyone gets hurt, it\u0027s going to be your fault, Markway.\" Markway explains that no one has ever been physically hurt by a ghost. Luke enters and directs his companions to something he saw in the hall. Someone or something has handwritten a message in chalk on the wall. It says, \"Help Eleanor Come Home.\" Eleanor reacts strongly. She first accuses Theo of playing a cruel joke. The two women bicker and Markway postpones the tour and tells Theo to take Eleanor to her room.The tour starts with the greenhouse. A large stone sculpture sits in the center of the room. It is supposed to be St. Francis curing the lepers, but Luke thinks its a family portrait of Hugh Crain and his wives and daughter. Suddenly, the door slams open and a gust of wind moves the plants. They approach the library, but Nell refuses to enter. The smell reminds her of her mother\u0027s sick room. Prominent in the room is a very tall, wrought iron, spiral staircase. Markway points out that the balcony high above is where the companion to Abigail Crain hanged herself. Luke climbs up a few feet on the staircase, but jumps back to the ground when it starts to sway and shake. Eleanor ventures out to the verandah and nearly falls over the balcony as she looks up to the tower above the library. Markway threatens to send her home, but Nell begs to stay. Markway suggests Theo and Nell share a bedroom... \"like sisters\". That evening, the two women discuss their lives and plans for the future. Nell makes up a story about having an apartment of her own. Just when Theo is about to make a move onto Nell, Markway calls them and Luke into the hallway outside the Nursery. He has discovered a cold spot. He invites all to experience the phenomenon. He gleefully explains, \"A cold spot, a genuine cold spot. I guarantee it won\u0027t register on any thermometer.\" Luke dismisses it as just a draft, but Markway says it is the heart of Hill House: The Nursery.In the middle of the night, Nell awakens. She hears a little girl laughing. She asks Theo to hold her hand, as their two beds are almost touching. The laughter continues and Nell complains, \"Theo, you\u0027re breaking my hand.\" The laughs turn to wimpering and Nell complains that something is hurting a child and she won\u0027t allow that to happen. She yells, \"Stop It!\" Theo turns on the light and we see Nell is on a day bed about twenty feet from the bed Theo occupies. Nell stares at her hand and asks, \"Whose hand was I holding?\" The next morning, Markway is in the music room and checks his watch and makes a note about the harp playing itself. Nell enters the room and asks about how it could play itself. Markway explains that it may be preternatural: Something we don\u0027t have any natural explanation for right now, but probably will have some day. Nell voices her fear that it is all in her imagination and concludes she may be going insane. She is haunted by the circumstances of her mother\u0027s death and that she may somehow be responsible. They both hear the harp play a note and Markway again checks his watch and makes a note in his paperwork.That evening, Luke finds a disturbing book that Hugh Crain made for his daughter, Abigail. Nell and Theo bicker and Markway notes that everyone\u0027s nerves are on edge. Theo continues to flirt as well as needle Nell, this time about a budding romance she fantasizes about with John Markway. Nell runs away and Theo catches up to her, and tells Nell that is he is making a fool of herself in thinking that Dr. Markway will ever get involved with her. Nell accuses Theo of being an \"unnatural thing\" as well as a \"nature\u0027s mistake.\" At that moment, a car horn honks and a taxi pulls up in front of the house. Grace Markway (Lois Maxwell), John\u0027s wife, arrives. She informs her husband, \"A reporter\u0027s been telephoning all day. He\u0027s on your track. He\u0027s heard about you renting this place.\" Grace begs her husband to abandon the house and his research. When John refuses, Grace pays the driver, grabs her suitcase and announces she is staying at Hill House, \"to join the ghost hunt.\" When Eleanor casually mentions the nursery as a place to stay, Grace quickly accepts the challenge, \"Thank you, my dear. The nursery it is.\" Markway and Nell try to dissuade her, but Grace responds, \"You insult my intelligence. You don\u0027t think I\u0027d believe anything you ghost hunters might tell me.\" Luke notices the door to the nursery is open for the first time. Grace decides to spend the night in the room, despite everyone\u0027s warning not to. Markway insists he and the three researchers spend the night downstairs in the parlor.Later that night, Nell and Theo sleep together on the sofa by the fireplace as Markway sleeps in a chair. Luke finishes his tour upstairs and enters the parlor. He heads for a bottle on the mantle. Suddenly, the parlor door slams shut by itself and the others wake with a start. They hear a deep rhythmic banging outside the door. Markway is concerned about his wife upstairs. Next a very loud banging comes from just outside the door. The unseen phantom presses against the parlor door as it bows inward and out like breathing, creaking and crunching against the hinges. The sound moves to overhead towards the nursery. Markway is desperate to check on his wife. Unseen, Nell runs from the parlor, through the music room, and upstairs directly to the nursery room. The doors are open, but Grace Markway is nowhere to be seen. Her bed shows signs of being used. Markway and the others arrive and start the search. Nell wanders away. She finds herself in the greenhouse. Descending into her own little world, Nell dances out onto the verandah. When she hears the others calling to her, Nell runs into the Library. She is drawn to the spiral staircase and the balcony at the top. Before she reaches the top, the rickety staircase begins its swaying, the lateral support bolts pulling away from the wall. Markway calls to her, begging her to carefully walk back down. She ignores him and stands on the balcony. Markway carefully climbs the stairs and joins Nell on the iron balcony platform. Before they walk back down, Nell sees Grace Markway peer at her through a trap door in the ceiling.A little later, Markway is furious and now insists Eleanor leave the house for her own safety. Luke brings her car around and Theo packs her bag. Nell tries to talk them out of her dismissal, but the three insist she leave. They escort Eleanor out to her car. Luke gets back out of Nell\u0027s car to retrieve the gate key from Markway. She drives off without Luke. Before she reaches the gate she is distracted by the white-robed figure of Grace Markway and crashes into a tree. The three find Eleanor dead in the half overturned car. She crashed into the same tree that killed the first Mrs. Crain. Grace wanders over to the accident scene. She explains to her husband, \"I didn\u0027t want any of this to happen. You must believe me, John.\" She explains that she woke and was frightened. She got lost looking for her husband and ended up in the attic. While Theo blames Grace for Eleanor\u0027s accident, Luke takes a different view. \"Eleanor did it to herself. It looked to me, anyway, like she deliberately aimed the car at this tree.\" Markway blames the house. Luke stares at the house and remarks, \"It ought to be burned down and the ground sowed with salt.\" We close with an evening shot of Hill House with Eleanor, now a ghost, narrating from beyond the grave about Hill House and that \"we who walk here... walk alone.\" The end title comes up as well as the final title card \u0027The Haunting\u0027 followed by eerie piano music.","Weighted Degree":"2.0","numvotes":"38733","productioncompany":"Argyle Enterprises","countriesoforigin":"United Kingdom","averagerating":"7.4","originaltitle":"The Haunting","size":"1","genres":"Horror Only","storyline":"Dr. Markway, doing research to prove the existence of ghosts, investigates Hill House, a large, eerie mansion with a lurid history of violent death and insanity.

A young girl named Rowan Morrison has been missing for a number of months and her mother is being uncooperative with enquiries. Due to the island\u0027s isolation it is unlikely she could have left by herself, abduction is suspected.Howie, a devout and celibate Christian, travels by seaplane to the island and is profoundly disturbed to find a society that worships the old pagan, Celtic gods of their ancestors. Couples copulate openly in the fields, children are taught in school of the phallic importance of the maypole, toads are placed in the mouth to cure whooping cough, and the island has no Christian ministers or priests. Its church and graveyards have long been deconsecrated and are now used for the idiosyncratic burial rituals of the locals, who believe in re-incarnation.In the course of his investigation, Howie encounters difficulty in extracting information from the islanders, who claim never to have heard of Rowan, and whose own mother insists does not exist. Rooming at The Green Man Inn, where he is introduced to the beautiful young daughter of the landlord, Willow, Howie notices a series of photographs celebrating the island\u0027s annual harvests adorning the wall of the bar with each photograph featuring a young girl, the May Queen. The latest photograph is missing due to it being \"broken\". No negative exists.After discovering a grave bearing Rowan Morrison\u0027s name in the cemetery, Howie\u0027s search eventually brings him into contact with the island\u0027s community leader, Laird and de facto figurehead Lord Summerisle, who explains to Howie the island\u0027s recent history and culture. Summerisle\u0027s grandfather, a distinguished Victorian scientist, developed several new strains of fruit that he believed could prosper in Scotland\u0027s climate given the proper conditions. Drawn to Summerisle\u0027s unique combination of fertile, volcanic soil and local waters heated by the Gulf Stream, he inculcated in the local populace a belief that the old gods were real and worshipping them by farming the new crop strains would deliver them from their meagre livelihood. The crops bore fruit and the island\u0027s Christian clergy were driven away, with the population now embracing pagan teachings wholesale. Enraged by Summerisle\u0027s glib comment that the Christian god is \"dead\", Howie demands permission to exhume Rowan\u0027s body, which Lord Summerisle subsequently grants, confident in the belief that such a deeply religious community as his is incapabale of murder. Howie\u0027s exhumation of the grave reveals only the body of a hare. He angrily confronts Summerisle once more, declaring that he believes that Rowan Morrison was murdered as part of a pagan sacrifice and that he intends to bring the full weight of the law upon the inhabitants of the island.Breaking into the local chemist\u0027s shop, Howie discovers that a negative of last year\u0027s harvest photograph does in fact exist. It shows Rowan standing amidst a meagre, pathetic group of boxes, indicating that last year\u0027s harvest was a poor one and that the crops the island\u0027s only means of income had failed. Struck by his recollection of an offhand remark made by Lord Summerisle about appeasing the old gods \"when necessary\" and by research that indicates pagan societies offer up a human sacrifice in the event of crop failure, Howie deduces that Rowan is in fact still alive and that she is being kept hidden until she can be sacrificed as part of the May Day celebrations to ensure a plentiful harvest for the coming year.Howie spends another night at the Inn where, in the room next to his, Willow sings to him and openly attempts to seduce him. The next morning, discovering that his plane has been sabotaged and is unable to take off, Howie elects to search the island for Rowan himself ahead of the impending May Day parade. Howie ties up the innkeeper and assumes his place as Punch, a principal character of the May Day festival. Disguised, he joins the procession of islanders as they cavort through the town and perform harmless sacrifices to the various lesser gods. Then Lord Summerisle announces that a grimmer sacrifice awaits them, and Rowan is finally revealed, tied to a post. Howie cuts her free and flees through a cave but after a brief chase emerges at another entrance on a precipice where Summerisle and his followers stand waiting for them. Howie is shocked to see Rowan merrily embrace her captors and then notices that he is being surrounded.Lord Summerisle explains to Howie that, after painstaking research on their behalf, he specifically was lured to Summerisle by the islanders, who have been successful in a conspiracy to lead him to believe that a missing girl was being held captive against her will, and confirms to him that last year\u0027s harvest failed disastrously, threatening the inhabitants with a return to their previously desperate existence and that they have no intention of allowing that to happen. Their religion calls for a sacrifice to be made to the Sun god as Lord Summerisle explains that, \"animals are fine, but their acceptibility is limited. A young child is even better, but not nearly as effective as the right kind of adult.\" Howie\u0027s devout Christian lifestyle and his livelihood as a policeman mean that he meets the outstanding criteria for a human that is to be sacrificed to appease the gods he has come of his own free will, with the power of a king and he is a virgin. In spite of his protestations that the crops failed because fruit was not meant to grow on these islands and that next year the sacrifice of Lord Summerisle himself will be called for, Howie is stripped bare, then dressed in ceremonial robes and led to the summit of a cliff with his hands tied. He is horrified to find a giant, hollow wicker man statue which he is then locked inside. The statue is soon set afire. As the islanders surround the burning wicker man and sing the Middle English folk-song \"Sumer Is Icumen In\", a terrified Howie curses them and recites Psalm 23 as he prays to God for accession to Heaven. The film ends as the burning head of the wicker man falls from its shoulders, as the sun sets in a blood-red sky.","Weighted Degree":"2.0","numvotes":"78669","productioncompany":"British Lion Film Corporation","countriesoforigin":"United Kingdom","averagerating":"7.5","originaltitle":"The Wicker Man","size":"1","genres":"Horror,Mystery,Thriller","storyline":"On Sunday, April 29, 1973, Sergeant Neil Howie with the West Highland Constabulary flies solo to Summerisle off the coast of Scotland.

The correspondence includes a photograph of Rowan. Upon his arrival on Summerisle, Howie finds that the locals are a seemingly simple minded lot who provide little information beyond the fact that they know of no Rowan Morrison and do not know the girl in the photo. Mrs. Morrison admits to having a daughter, seven year old Myrtle, but no Rowan. As Howie speaks to more and more people, he begins to believe that Rowan does or did live on the island, but that the locals are hiding their knowledge of her. He also begins to see that the locals all have pagan beliefs, their \"religion\" which centers on procreation as the source of life. That procreation does not necessarily need to be within marriage, and openly flaunts the act of sex, both in private and in public. These beliefs do not sit well against Howie\u0027s strict Christian morals, he who regularly attends church, prays, and accepts communion. Everything that happens on the island seems to be dictated by Lord Summerisle, whose ancestors bought the island generations ago.

With May Day approaching, Howie not only tries to find out if Rowan was indeed murdered/sacrificed, which includes trying to locate her body, but if there will be another sacrifice on this important day within the cycle of life. —Huggo","Clustering Coefficient":"0.0","genre":"Mystery","Number of triangles":"0"},"color":"rgb(33,100,92)","size":65.08197021484375},{"label":"Cronos","x":-270.6576232910156,"y":561.35693359375,"id":"tt0104029","attributes":{"year":"1993","runtimeminutes":"94","synopsis":"\"In 1536, fleeing from the Inquisition, the alchemist Humberto Oganelli disembarked in Veracruz, Mexico. Appointed official watchmaker to the viceroy, Oganelli was determined to perfect an invention which would   provide him with the key to eternal life. He was to name it the Cronos device. Four hundred years later, one night in 1937, part of a wall in a building collapsed. Amongst the victims was a man of strange skin, the color of marble in moonlight, his chest mortally pierced. His last words: Sua tempore. This was the alchemist. The authorities located the residence of the dead man. What they found there was never fully revealed to the public. After a brief investigation, the mansion and its contents were sold at public auction. Never on any list or inventory was the Cronos device mentioned. As far as anyone knew, it never existed.\"What was not revealed to the public was that a human male was found hanging from his feet, his blood draining into a basin. Also unknown to the public, except for a dying millionaire named de la Guardia [Claudio Brook] who will stop at nothing to obtain it, the Cronos device had been hidden in the base of a statue of an archangel. De la Guardia had spent his life acquiring old statues of archangels, always in search of the hidden Cronos device... so far in vain... until the day that the archangel shows up in the antique shop of Jesus Gris [Frederico Luppi]. Jesus and his granddaughter find the device and, not knowing what it is, Jesus activates it. He is horrified as claws protrude from the orb, hold fast to his hand and proceed to dig into   his flesh.Meanwhile, de la Guardia (who lives in an antiseptic chamber) sends his nephew Angel [Ron Perlman] to buy the archangel. When the statue proves to be empty, however, Angel is forced to take strong measures. He kills Jesus. Fortunately, Jesus has come to realize that the Cronos device confers immortality, and he uses it. But there is a cost. He begins to crave human blood, and his flesh starts peeling off, exposing a strange layer of skin, the color of marble in moonlight. In the final confrontation between Jesus, de la Guardia, and Angel, Jesus emerges victorious. Still, he smashes the Cronos device and goes home to Aurora and his girlfriend... to die. [Original synopsis by bj_kuehl]___   A voice over (Jorge Martínez de Hoyos) tells the story of Humberto Oganelli (Mario Iván Martínez), an Alchimist who arrived to Veracruz in Mexico running away from the Inquisition. In 1937, a building collapsed, and a grey-skinned men was discovered. It was Oganellli, the inventor of the Cronos device. He is supposed to die at that moment, impalled onto an iron stick. Every together renmant of that building was auctioned, including the small statue of an angel.Years later, the angel appears at the antiquarian\u0027s shop. Somebody (Luis Rodríguez) enters to look at it but leaves without buying it. Jesús Gris (Federico Luppi) has bought it. He realises that the angel is hollow, because, through one of the eyes\u0027 empty plaster socket, several huge bus fall down to the floor. Jesús picks up a kind of oval machinery thingy; it\u0027s the Cronos watch, a golden watch in the shape of a metal scarab. His mute granddaughter, Aurora (Tamara Shanath) is with him when he finds it.Ángel de la Guardia (Ron Perlman) is told where the angel statue is. In his turn, he tells his uncle, a millionaire De la Guardia (Claudio Brook) the news. De la Guardia wants the angel statue at all costs. Ángel buys it for him.Jesús wants to keep the watch. He sets the machiney onto motion. At first, it looks safe, but then 6 cocroach-like legs protude from the watch and make a hole on his hand. He doesn\u0027t let Aurora to get near the thing. His girlfriend Mercedes (Margarita Isabel), a tango-dance teacher, tends to his wound. She takes out a kind of metal sting from his hand and gives him some stiches.At night, Jesús doesn\u0027t feel very well. He goes to drink some water to the fridge, but the thing which attracts him the most is the bright red meat. Jesús feels restless. He sets the watch in motion again. A fourth sting comes out of the back side of the watch. That morning, the sun is shining outside. Jesús draws the curtains. His face looks much longer, but he shaves and he tells his girlfriend that he looks much younger because he has saved his white-haired moustache.When Jesús arrives to the shop, it has been vandalised. He contronts Ángel. He is frustrated because the archangel statue was hollow... and empty. De la Guardia tells him about the history of the Cronos mechanism. He also admits that he\u0027s dying of his sickness, and no treatment has worked so far. Jesús doesn\u0027t want to lose the Cronos. Jesús leaves on a hurry by the rooftop trying to look for Aurora, as he suddenly realises she\u0027s in danger. Aurora has picked up the Cronos to play with it. When he finds Aurora, he realises that she is frightened and tries to hide from him, or maybe she\u0027s scared about him, in any case she stops playing with her toy teaset and hides away from him. He tries to calm her down. She has hidden the Cronos inside her teddy bear. Immediately, Jesús uses the Cronos again, this time on his chest.Jesús is still guessing at the nature of the Cronos, but he feels that it\u0027s doing him good. His chest wound now expels a kind of mucose, and his eyes feel weird. Mercedes insists on his leaving the bathroom and go with her to the New Year\u0027s Eve party. Mercedes wonders how anyone can change so fast in such a short period of time. They dance in love there at the party. Aurora goes with them, but the girl usually stays on her own, silent as always. During the party, a man (Javier Álvarez) gets hurt and starts bleeding profusely. Jesús can\u0027t refrain from following that man to the gent\u0027s. They make small talk, but Jesús can\u0027t stop himself from staring at the spilled blood. He gets down on the floor to lick a blood stain. Somebody kicks him while he\u0027s doing that, knocking him out. The countdown to the first day of the year is being celebrated by everybody else. Meanwhile, Jesús is pushed out of the place where the party takes place.When he wakes up, he\u0027s in a car with Ángel, who beats him up. Ángel won\u0027t stop seeking the Cronos. Jesús asks what they want it for. Ángel leaves Jesús unconscious. Ángel pushes the car down from a cliff with Jesús inside.A funeral technician called Tito (Daniel Giménez Cacho) is preparing Jesús\u0027 corpse for burial. He is told that he\u0027ll be cremated, so all his excellent artistic work will be useless. De la Guardia tells off his nephew because he couldn\u0027t get the scarab and probably Jesús is still alive. Ángel goes to the funeral home and tries to wake Jesús up by closing his nostrils. Ángel leaves him for dead. Tito prepares the crematorium to burn the coffin - but there are problems with the gas and the piping, as all the tubes and pipes are really old and they would need maintenance. The technician leaves the room for some seconds to solve the problem. He doesn\u0027t realise that the coffee is empty, he just closes it down again without thinking about it. Ángel appears with the funeral house director (Juan Carlos Colombo) to enquire about the body of Jesús. The technician shows him the empty coffin burning to ashes in the oven. Ángel smiles.It\u0027s freezing. It\u0027s night. Jesús walks dazed confused and with a grey wounded face. He stops by a rubbish bin and he sees printed his own orbituary. Jesús tries to phone Mercedes. When he finally speaks up, Mercedes hangs up. Jesús limps home. It\u0027s Christmas and decorations are on the streets and the main hall of his building. He is opened the door by Aurora, who offers a towel for him. Jesús uses the Cronos mechanism again.Daylight really hurts him, so he hides inside an old trunk. Aurora paints the trunk and keeps on playing. Jesús writes a long letter to Mercedes. Jesús\u0027 faces is worst still. Jesús comes back to De la Guardia\u0027s warehouse, and he realises that Aurora has followed him. He tries to scare her away. She finds the little book written by Humberto Oganelli. There are some pages missing, and De la Guardia says that he\u0027s eaten them. De la Guardia takes off some pieces of dangling skin from Jesús\u0027 face nows feels metalic. De la Guardia rings the bell for his son. Ángel is pissed off at being disturbed by his uncle. De la Guardia tells Jesús that he needs to artifact to keep himself alive, and that he also needs blood. Jesús shows the Cronos to him and asks for the exit. De la Guardia knighs him. He fights with Jesús, but Aurora hits De la Guardia with a long stick. Jesús wakes up. Ángel appears and he tries to talk to his uncle. Jesús drinks the blood from De la Guardia\u0027s body. Ángel gets off from the lift and finds his uncle dead. Jesús and Aurora have hidden away. Ángel laughs with joy as everything will become his. However, at that moment, De la Guardia asks him for help, but his nephew kills him, fed up of being kept waiting. Jesús and Aurora hit Ángel. They run across the rooftops. He tells her granddaughter to leave by doing down the façade\u0027s ladder. Ángel hits Jesús. His victim looks week and unable to defend himself: he can only crawl away from him. To end the matter, Jesús throws himself agains Ángel\u0027s body, making him fall to the floor. Aurora sets the mechanism onto motion. Inside the scarab, a huge bag gives Jesús life. Aurora caresses Jesús\u0027 deformed face. Jesús peels off his own skin. Aurora was a bit hurt, so she\u0027s broken her lip. She offers her blood to Jesús, who finally decides to reject it with a supreme effort. Jesús shouts \"NO!\", and he removes the Cronos from his chest. He uses a stone to break it into pieces.

An Egyptian archaeology expedition finds an ancient badge in the sand. Archaeologists Stephen Banning [Felix Aylmer] and Joseph Whemple [Raymond Huntley] take it to show to Stephen\u0027s son John [Peter Cushing] who is resting in a nearby tent because he has a broken leg. They believe the badge indicates they are close to finding the concealed tomb of Princess Ananka on the basis that the badge may have come from one of her soldiers. Despite their excitement they are also concerned about the implications of John\u0027s leg having not been treated and therefore not healing properly. At the entrance to the tomb, they are stopped by an Egyptian man Mehemet Bey [George Pastell] who implores them not to open the tomb for fear of the consequences but Stephen and Joseph ignore him and enter. Inside they find the sarcophagus of the Princess. Joseph goes back outside to tell John of their discovery. Stephen remains inside and finds a scroll of life but as he picks it up a door in the wall of the tomb opens behind him. Outside, Joseph and John hear Stephen scream and Joseph re-enters the tomb to find Stephen comatose.Several months later and Joseph and John are removing the last of the relics from the tomb. They discuss Stephen, who has been in a mental hospital ever since and may never be cured. After everything has been removed, one of their Egyptian servants re-seals the tomb with explosives. Nearby, Mehemet Bey offers a prayer for vengeance against those who have desecrated the tomb. He has the scroll of life with him.England 1898. After three years at the mental hospital, Stephen has improved and John goes to visit him. Stephen does not remember John\u0027s broken leg but he remembers that when he read the scroll of life in Princess Ananka\u0027s tomb, he brought a mummy back to life and he becomes agitated. John does not believe him but Stephen warns him that someone has the scroll and the mummy will be released again.Two drunk men leave a nearby pub to transport a wooden crate on their horse and cart. At the nursing home, Stephen becomes agitated about the mummy again and smashes the window just as the horse and cart pass. The crate on the cart starts bouncing about so the men panic and increase their speed, but the crate becomes loose and falls off the cart into a watery bog. The police and men search for the crate but are unable to find it. Mehemet Bey appears and tells the police the men were transporting the crate to him at a nearby large house and that it contained ancient relics.At the nursing home, the doctor [Willoughby Gray] explains to John that Stephen has had to be restrained but they do not really understand the reasons for his agitation.At the bog, Mehemet Bey reads the scroll of life to resurrect the mummy [Christopher Lee]. Bey instructs the mummy to seek out those who desecrated the tomb and take vengeance against them. The mummy goes to the mental hospital, breaks through the bars of the window to Stephen\u0027s room and strangles him.At the subsequent inquest the conclusion is forced entry and murder by person or persons unknown. Joseph and John return home to look through Stephen\u0027s papers in an attempt to discover who may have wished Stephen harm. They discuss the discovery of Princess Ananka\u0027s tomb and the point when Stephen lost his mind.

Her body is taken in a long procession by Kharis to be entombed along with various symbolic relics and statues. Her body is laid to rest in a tomb in the side of a mountain a thousand miles from her home. In various ceremonies over the following days slaves and maidens are sacrificed to ensure the location of the tomb remains a secret. Finally Kharis returns to the tomb alone with the scroll of life. He had secretly been in love with Ananka, which was forbidden for a priest, and tries to bring her back to life by reading the scroll. However, he is caught in the act and sentenced to have his tongue cut out and to remain on guard for eternity at the tomb.

As Stephen screams, Bey enters the tomb and orders the mummy back into its burial chamber. Bey leaves with the scroll. Mulrooney does not believe John\u0027s story about the mummy killing Joseph, saying he wants facts. John warns Mulrooney that he may be next to be killed.At the police station, the poacher is brought in and describes to Mulrooney the figure he saw in the woods. Mulrooney also interviews one of the men who transported the crate, and the policeman who searched for the crate in the bog and spoke to Bey.Bey offers another prayer to his god and instructs the mummy to destroy the last of the tomb\u0027s desecrators.At his home John notices that his wife Isobel [Yvonne Furneaux] bears a striking resemblance to a picture of Princess Ananka. John mentions his fears about being attacked by the mummy to Isobel and asks her to remain upstairs where she will be safe. John gets a shotgun ready as the mummy makes its way towards his house. The mummy breaks in through the windows and John shoots it but to no avail. He then impales the mummy with a spear but the mummy still attacks and starts to strangle him. Isobel runs downstairs and when the mummy sees her he stops strangling John. The mummy approaches Isobel calmly because of her resemblance to Princess Ananka, then leaves the house quietly.Mulrooney returns to the house now believing John\u0027s story and asks John about the Egyptian man living in the house near the nursing home. After Mulrooney leaves, John heads towards Bey\u0027s house. Inside the house Bey believes the mummy has killed all three desecrators and orders the mummy to rest before they return home. John arrives at Bey\u0027s house and they exchange courtesies. Bey wonders why archaeologists like John desecrate Egyptian tombs which were meant to be sealed for all time and John explains it is so they can understand history and civilisation. John expresses his opinion that the ancient Egyptians lacked intelligence because they believed in a worthless god and sacrificed people violently. Bey disagrees as it is part of Egyptian culture and suggests John should be punished for his views. John apologises and in the process of leaving notices Bey has the seal to Ananka\u0027s tomb on a table. Bey returns to pray to his god to apologise for his failure and promises that he will ensure the last desecrator will be dead before sunrise.John returns home and he, Isobel and Mulrooney prepare for the arrival of the mummy with loaded guns. Isobel and Mulrooney and a policeman hide in the woods around the house. Bey and the mummy approach through the woods and attack first the poacher, then the policeman, then knock Mulrooney unconscious before entering the house. The mummy attacks John and he fires twice before the mummy starts to strangle him. Isobel runs in and tells the mummy to stop. At first the mummy ignores her, until John instructs her to let her hair down so she more closely resembles Princess Ananka. Bey orders the mummy to kill her but when it refuses he tries to stab her himself. The mummy attacks Bey and Isobel faints. The mummy picks up Isobel and carries her to the bog followed by John, Mulrooney and several men. John calls to Isobel to wake her up and she instructs the mummy to put her down. Once she is free the men open fire and the mummy sinks into the bog water clutching the scroll of life.","Weighted Degree":"2.0","numvotes":"9410","productioncompany":"Hammer Films","countriesoforigin":"United Kingdom","averagerating":"6.7","originaltitle":"The Mummy","size":"1","genres":"Adventure,Horror","storyline":"In the 1890s a team of British archaeologists discover the untouched tomb of Princess Ananka but accidentally bring the mummified body of her High Priest back to life.

The older nun goes through the door to find some kind of artifact, while the younger nun, Sister Victoria (Charlotte Hope) starts to pray. The older nun emerges attacked and bloodied, telling Victoria to run before she is pulled back into the darkness. Victoria runs toward a window as the attacker while clutching a key, the demon nun Valak (Bonnie Aarons), moves slowly but closer toward her. Victoria asks God for forgiveness before she jumps and hangs herself. Sometime later, her decaying body is discovered by a man simply known as Frenchie (Jonas Bloquet).The officials at the Vatican learn of Victoria\u0027s suicide, which is considered the ultimate sin. They enlist Father Anthony Burke (Demian Bichir) to investigate. He seeks out a young novitiate named Sister Irene (Taissa Farmiga), who currently acts as a teacher to young girls. The two get together and go to find Frenchie so he can take them to where he found Victoria\u0027s body.The three go to the abbey where Frenchie leads Burke and Irene to the ice box where he left Victoria\u0027s body. Frenchie points out that Victoria is sitting up when he left her body lying down. Burke pries Victoria\u0027s fingers open and finds the key in her hand. They then take her body to give her a proper burial. While walking back toward the abbey, Burke notices fresh blood on the steps where Frenchie found Victoria\u0027s body. They then go into the chapel but cannot enter the abbey yet. They meet the Abbess (Gabrielle Downey), who informs them that are engaging in a vow of silence for Victoria, and that they may enter the next day.Burke and Irene go to their rooms while Frenchie leaves. He walks past the dark woods and sees what looks like Victoria walking through the woods. He follows her and ends up attacked by a demon nun. Frenchie picks up a cross from the ground and walks away with it.Irene tells Burke about a series of visions she experienced as a child, all of which ended with her hearing the phrase \"Mary points the way\". Burke then recalls an incident in France in which he was summoned to exorcise a young boy named Daniel (August Maturo) that had been possessed. Despite Burke\u0027s efforts, the boy sustained fatal injuries from the exorcism, and Burke has been wracked with guilt ever since.Later that night, Burke is awoken by the sound of music. He goes out into the woods and sees what looks like a demonic version of Daniel. The vision comes to life and pushes Burke into a coffin before an unholy force buries him alive, leaving him with a bell to ring. Irene also wakes up and wanders the chapel before she sees Valak in the mirror trying to attack her. She runs outside and hears Burke ringing the bell. Soon, multiple bells around graves start to ring, but Irene manages to find Burke\u0027s coffin and she starts to dig him up. Before she can reach him, demon hands start to pull at him, but Irene manages to free him. Inside the coffin, Burke then finds a bunch of books on the occult.The next day, Burke and Irene go to the abbey, but only Irene is allowed to enter. She meets Sister Oana (Ingrid Bisu), who tells her that the nuns change shifts to pray to keep evil at bay. Oana hears about Irene seeing Valak, and Oana explains the demon\u0027s origin. When the abbey was built during the Dark Ages, a duke obsessed with the powers of Hell tried to open a rift to summon Valak, but several men found and killed the duke before Valak could fully emerge, keeping him trapped using an artifact (the same one the nuns from before were looking for) containing the blood of Christ. He remained sealed in Hell until bombs from World War II dropped around the abbey and broke the rift open, setting the demon loose. Oana explains that Valak takes the form of a nun to look like the rest of them and prey on their weaknesses. Meanwhile, Burke reads about Valak and learns his name.Frenchie is in a tavern where he hears that one of the patrons had a 12-year-old daughter that committed suicide by hanging after allegedly seeing something horrible. After Frenchie tells the bartender that he went up with Burke and Irene to the abbey, the bartender warns Frenchie that the two of them may be the next victims.Burke once again attempts to enter the abbey, only to encounter the Abbess again to tell him he won\u0027t find another way in. He tries to ask the Abbess about the key that he found with Victoria, but she tells Burke it\u0027s too late and that Irene is lost. Her body then appears to go limp. Burke tries to lift her veil to see her, but her demonic body grabs at him until he rips her hand off of him.Irene awakens after seeing another frightening vision of Valak. She wanders outside her room and is once again attacked by the demon nun. Burke hears the noise and tries to save her but he is also attacked until Frenchie shows up with a shotgun. Irene finds the other nuns and starts to pray alongside them as an evil force carves a pentagram into her back. Irene then sees what looks like Oana\u0027s dead body, but she quickly realizes that Oana and the other nuns were not real, but visions.The three reunite as they realize that Victoria was not trying to commit suicide, but rather sacrifice herself so that Valak could not possess her body and spread terror. They head into the catacombs to find the artifact with Christ\u0027s blood. Irene realizes that \"Mary points the way\" is in reference to the statue of Mary that literally points the way to where they may find the artifact. Sure enough, they come across the vial containing the blood after opening its chamber using Victoria\u0027s key. Soon, Valak reemerges and attacks the trio. He starts to try and possess Irene while Burke is attacked by the demonic Daniel. Irene is briefly possessed, but Frenchie manages to throw some blood on her to free her. Valak unleashes a dark force upon Frenchie, and then tries to drown Irene. He pulls her up and sees that the vial is broken. She spits the blood in Valak\u0027s face, sending the demon back to Hell and sealing the rift.As the trio leave the abbey, Irene asks Frenchie his real name, and he says it\u0027s Maurice. We then see an upside down cross burned into the back of Maurice\u0027s neck.The film concludes with a clip from the first \"Conjuring\" movie in the present day where Carolyn Perron (Lili Taylor) is watching Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) give a seminar on their encounter with the possessed Maurice, who later committed suicide. His contact with Lorraine caused her to see visions, and unfortunately for her, it would not be the last time that she encountered Valak.","Weighted Degree":"3.0","numvotes":"135199","productioncompany":"Atomic Monster","countriesoforigin":"United States, Romania","averagerating":"5.3","originaltitle":"The Nun","size":"1","genres":"Horror,Mystery,Thriller","storyline":"When a young nun at a cloistered abbey in Romania takes her own life, a priest with a haunted past and a novitiate on the threshold of her final vows are sent by the Vatican to investigate.

We open with a woman, Carolyn Hayes (Jana Lund) running towards the camera. She is being chased by a man, Hans Himmler (Mike Lane). She stops, looks back, screams, and then continues running. We only see the man from the waist down as he plods along with a limp. The woman is cornered, now at the same location where the titles and credits were shot. The creature approaches as the woman walks backwards into the lake. The monster grabs the girl, then holds her under water. The director, Douglas Row (Don Red Barry) calls, \"Cut!\" The actor playing the monster does not speak English, so Shuter (Norbert Schiller) must translate. Morgan Haley (John Dennis), the cameraman, confirms that the scene was ok. Doug checks the length of the scene with Judy Stevens (Charlotte Austin). Doug and Judy are divorced and things are still a little frosty in their relationship. He tells her, \"Jealousy, jealousy, lover. Don\u0027t blame me because you\u0027re no longer an ingénue. Well, I keep you on the payroll, you\u0027ll have to admit I\u0027m loyal.\" She tartly replies, \"Oh yes, you\u0027re loyal to wives number one through four inclusive.\" Carolyn is helped from the water. She tells Mike Shaw (Tom Duggan) that this movie scene is to celebrate the 230th anniversary of Frankenstein.Inside the castle, Baron Victor von Frankenstein (Boris Karloff) berates his old friend Wilhelm Gottfried (Rudolph Anders), \"How could you inflict these people upon me Gottfried?\" Gottfried reminds the Baron that he agreed to let the film crew use his castle for the money he needed to purchase a reactor for his experiments. He adds, \"I\u0027ve been wanting to talk to you about this Victor. You have been spending money and money. You have been buying equipment as though you were a government.\" Gottfried has been handling the Baron\u0027s finances and has sold most of his art treasures. The discussion turns to the past. The Baron was tortured during the past and is bitter and scarred. He sports a long scar that runs from his left eye to the corner of his mouth. It is apparent that his nose was severely broken. He was forced to perform medical experiments. The Baron is the last of the House of Frankenstein. The film cast and crew return to the castle. Doug Row briefs the Baron on his upcoming performance. Doug is pushy and obnoxious. The Baron is having reservations about involvement in this exploitation of his family history, but he wants that atomic reactor badly and reluctantly cooperates with Row. He has contempt for all but one. He is strangely attracted to Carolyn Hayes and tells her so, \"That could be my pleasure with you as my leading lady, Miss Hayes.\" He takes her hand and kisses it. She recoils slightly, repelled by the Baron\u0027s clumsy advances. Turning back to the director, the Baron tells him, \"Mr. Row, I\u0027m becoming reconciled to your presence here. Your coming here may be the solution to all my problems.\" The Baron laughs maniacally then limps away. He seats himself at an organ and plays a melancholy tune.It is rehearsal day in the basement of the castle. The Baron reads an inscription on the tomb of an ancestor. \"I, Frankenstein, began my work in the year 1740 and with all good intentions and humane thoughts to the high purpose of probing the secrets of life itself - with but one end - the betterment of mankind.\" He explains his ancestor\u0027s work, as he limps around the basement, and what went wrong. The scene is disrupted when Carolyn screams as the Baron appears ready to stab the corpse on the slab. Hans tells Shuter he is finished and will no longer work at the castle. Row\u0027s cash payment convinces Hans to remain. The Baron was off script, as Judy reminds her ex-husband, but Doug loved it anyway.The cast and crew are relaxing in the great room of the castle. Mike is on the phone. Carolyn, Gottfried, and Judy are relaxing and having coffee. The Baron is playing the organ. Judy presents Shuter with a gift, a plaid scarf. She wraps it around his neck, then gives him a friendly kiss on the cheek. The Baron is not amused. He confronts his servant, \"Shuter. You are richly endowed to have one as lovely as Miss Hayes bestow gifts upon you.\" Row enters the room with script changes, then exits with Carolyn under the pretext of going over her new scene. Gottfried confronts the Baron with his concerns. It seems that the Baron has been working with the Director of the Morgue. \"Are you interested in corpses?\" He asks the Baron. The Baron makes his friend uneasy with his menacing demeanor. The Baron lights a candle, douses the lights in the Great Room, then descends the stairs to the basement crypt. He twists the head on a statue. A stone crypt lid slides open. The Baron climbs inside and descends the stairs to his secret lab below. A large modern lab is revealed. The walls are covered with electronic equipment and the centerpiece is a nuclear reactor. The Baron listens in on his guests with hidden microphones in their rooms. Studying an old picture of himself, he admires a clay bust - still a work in progress. He opens the reactor door and a gurney of a bandaged figure emerges. The head is just a skull. The Baron dons a lab apron, and washes his hands. Shuter is upstairs securing the castle. The Baron returns to his creature, another work in progress. He removes the bandages on the arm. He records his observations on a reel to reel tape machine. Shuter walks downstairs to the crypt area, securing it for the night. He activates the crypt door by accident. He investigates the open sarcophagus, walks down the hidden stairs, and encounters the Baron. The Baron is sorry to see his old friend and trusted servant has discovered his secret, \"Shuter. Ah, my poor Shuter. Why did it have to be you?\" He becons his servant to approach the body and promises that he will live again. He hypnotizes Shuter. The Baron harvests Shuter\u0027s heart for his creation.The next morning Carolyn is fixing breakfast. She notes that Shuter is absent. Judy calls for Shuter, but he is gone. The Baron explains that Shuter is away visiting relatives and may be away for some time. The Baron returns to his lab. He notes that Shuter\u0027s brain is now in the skull of his creature. He prepares to install the eyes. He retrieves a pair, in a glass jar, from the lab refrigerator. The closing door bumps his arm and he drops the container. The eyes are destroyed.Sometime later, Gottfried is reviewing some papers in the library as the Baron plays his organ. Carolyn enters and joins the Baron at the organ. He turns to ogle his guest, \"You seem rather disturbed my dear.\" She tells the Baron that organ music reminds her of death. The Baron notices Carolyn has Shuter\u0027s scarf. She tells him she found it down in the basement. The Baron takes the scarf from Carolyn, places it around his own neck, and then resumes playing his creepy tune. Gottfried enters and asks where Shuter has gone. He notes Shuter has no relatives and a quick search of his room revealed all his clothes are still there. The Baron threatens to tell Gottfried the tale of the inquisitive Commandant of the prison camp. The Baron delights in recounting the tale telling Gottfried that one day his tormentor was found without a tongue. He is gleeful, \"Imagine the irony of it Gottfried. Oh, I know, I was called in to examine the poor wretch. A beautiful piece of surgery, if I do say so myself. Beautiful.\" Gottfried seems to get the message and leaves the room.In the lab, the Baron moves his creature back into the reactor and closes the door. He starts the reactor, and steam wafts from the machine. The demand for power causes the lights in the castle to dim. An alarm bill signals the completion of the process. The body is brought out of the reactor. The Baron\u0027s intercom allows him to hear Doug\u0027s unsuccessful attempt to gain access to Carolyn\u0027s locked room. The Baron examines his creation. Judy types in her room, while Mike sleeps fitfully in his. The Baron\u0027s creation is now standing, still strapped to the gurney. He attempts to contact the mind of Shuter, now encased in his creation. Finally the EEG shows a reaction. He orders Shuter to raise each arm, the creature follows the instructions. The last order of business is to secure a pair of eyes. Mike visits Judy in her room. He has a bottle and glass. Mike kisses Judy, then pours and downs a glass of liquor. He tries another pass, but gets thrown out of Judy\u0027s room. She locks him out and tells him to go to bed. A subsequent knock at the door brings Judy back to scold Mike. When she opens the door the creature is there. She screams and faints. It carries her to the lab, but the Baron chastises his creation. He wanted Row\u0027s eyes. Her eyes were unsuitable and the Baron puts them in a disposal device.Doug and Mike argue over Judy\u0027s sudden disappearance. Doug is skeptical considering she left without an alimony check. The Baron claims to know nothing about it. Row suggests using the Baron\u0027s lab as a setting for the TV show. The Baron asks, \"Gottfried, is the laboratory included in the contract with Mr. Row?\" The answer is no, which prompts the Baron to reply, \"Then you cannot use it.\" When pressed, the Baron is adamant -- the answer is NO!Morgan and Carolyn go to the basement crypt to set up shots. Carolyn practices her moves, unaware the creature is behind her in shadow. Carolyn leaves and Morgan remains to line up a few more shots. He looks through his lens and pans around the room. The creature comes into frame and approaches the cinematographer. Back in the lab the Baron examines the eyeballs, but declares them unsuitable due to blood type mismatch. Another pair of eyes are disposed. Inspector Raab (Irwin Berke) takes a missing persons report from Doug Row. The Baron tells the policeman that Judy was married to Mr. Row, so she must have been emotionally disturbed and Morgan went to Frankfurt to get a special lens. Carolyn tells Raab she last saw Morgan in the basement. The Baron volunteers to escort Raab to see for himself. While all are down in the basement looking for Morgan, the Baron sees the sarcophagus lid swing open. He closes it. Finding nothing, Raab apologizes to the Baron for the intrusion.Gottfried comments to the Baron on all the disappearances. The not so subtle reminders to those who question him gone unheeded, the Baron finally agrees to satisfy Gottfried\u0027s curiosity. They descend into the crypt. The Baron opens the sarcophagus entrance to his lab. The creature stares at his next victim through opening in the bandages where eyes should be. The Baron kills his old friend and installs the eyes in his creation. He disposes of Gottfried\u0027s clothes in the disposal. Doug and Mike examine the crypt area for clues. Doug finds Morgan\u0027s view finder. He tells Mike he intends to report this to Inspector Raab. The Baron uses a coin from his collection to hypnotize Mike Shaw. He questions Mike about Row. He directs Mike to get Carolyn at a designated time. Row meets with Raab. He convinces Raab that Judy, Shuter, and Morgan never left the castle. At the designated time Mike fetches Carolyn from her room. Carolyn is confronted by the still bandaged creature. As Raab and Row drive back to the castle, the creature carries Carolyn down to the Baron\u0027s lab. She wakes and screams. Carolyn pleads with Shuter to bring her back upstairs. He is conflicted between his affection for Carolyn and the Baron\u0027s orders. The Baron fires up his machine. Shuter enters the lab without Carolyn and trashes the place. He walks towards the Baron and is overcome by the atomic steam.The charred remains of the Baron\u0027s creation is prone on the floor. A man in a radiation suit takes readings. He allows Raab to enter the lab. Two police officers, Row and Mike also walk in. Raab peels back the bandages on the face of the creature. A younger, unscarred Baron\u0027s face is shown. Row plays back the tape and hears, \"I made you in my image so the name of Frankenstein could survive. I gave you eyes, ears, a heart, a brain and.\" The voice fades out. We close with a close-up of the creature\u0027s head with the face of the Baron.","Weighted Degree":"2.0","numvotes":"1158","productioncompany":"Aubrey Schenck Productions","countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"4.9","originaltitle":"Frankenstein 1970","size":"1","genres":"Horror,Sci-Fi","storyline":"Baron Victor von Frankenstein has fallen on hard times; he was tortured at the hands of the Nazis for not cooperating with them during World War II and he is now badly disfigured.

They are going to cut his fingers but Ed Reid, who had hidden himself and tried to stay out of it, makes some noise and is seen. Ed ends up paying Lionel\u0027s debt with a cheque, and the thug requests that he signs an autograph for him, as Ed Reid is quite a famous writer. Next week, Lionel will have to pay again.

He tells him off, because he is constantly messing everything up. Clara is crazy for having a perfect carpet. Her attitude is totally opposite when Ed tells her that he won\u0027t be able to pay rent that week. She tells him not to worry about that, because she loves the sexy way he writes. She also flirts with him, and shows him kinky underwear and a whip. She wants him to describe her aloud. She likes it, but she wants some more, to be described as he describes Laura, the sexy flight attendant. She insists in being described later on, and tells him that they are arguing about the rent.

Jeff and Hayley have either been invited or gotten themselves invited by the elite who have tons of connections that can help Jeff\u0027s burgeoning career as a playwright. He gives Hayley guidelines on how to behave making his wife even more nervous as she heads to the door.They knock and Sebastian opens the door and he pretty much asks them what they are doing here before closing the door on their face. Jeff has no self-esteem and knocks again. This time Sebastian answers with an ostentatious mask on his head that seems like horns of the devil. He invites the couple in and Hayley promptly hands him a bottle of wine. Sebastian isn\u0027t impressed because he thinks it is a twelve dollar bottle wine.The couple is introduced to Carmine, Vincent and Sadie. Some offhand remarks are passed and Hayley excuses herself to go to the bathroom. When she goes upstairs, she thinks she is seeing a statue in the bathroom. When she comes out, the statue is actually Agatha, another guest who hates wearing clothes.Hayley shies away and goes downstairs. At dinner, all the guests begin to show off their knowledge about opera music playing the background. Jeff brings up a story about having a lucky charm that is a chess piece. He\u0027s made fun of believing in plastic that is harmful to the environment. He\u0027s supposed to pick a lucky charm that is environment-friendly.Hayley stands up for him but he doesn\u0027t do the same when Hayley begins talking about her painful past where she was molested by one parent and seen her mother cut her own throat after killing her husband for touching their daughter inappropriately.The guests seem to like Hayley and sympathize with her. Jeff is embarrassed Hayley brought it up, excuses themselves and threatens her to behave in front of these sophisticated people.Sadie isn\u0027t too happy to see Hayley being treated so shabbily. Hayley goes away and when Sadie stretches her arms, Jeff makes a comment about her unshaved armpits to which Sadie reminds him that his opinion is neither desired nor required.Jeff is humiliated but his ego remains. Hayley takes her medication and when the guests are served wine, Jeff takes her glass since it would interfere with her medication.Soon the wine starts taking effect and Jeff realizes he\u0027s been drugged. Hayley too has been given some wine and she starts to feel woozy.The very next instant, Jeff\u0027s neck is chopped off. Hayley is shocked but too drunk to do anything but watch as blood splatters on the glass and the placement. She loses consciousness.When she awakens, Agatha is dressed in lingerie and Hayley is tied to a chair and made to watch as Agatha talks about putting herbs in Jeff\u0027s drink. She uses Jeff\u0027s headless body to satisfy herself. Hayley turns away.   When Hayley comes too again, she\u0027s at the kitchen where Jeff\u0027s body is being cut into pieces and being cooked. She\u0027s tied with black scarves that she easily frees herself from. Perhaps the hosts tied her casually for a reason. They wanted her to run because her anguish and desperation is entertainment to them.She runs outside and coincidentally finds the sheriff\u0027s car parked some distance away from the mansion. Sebastian follows her and explains to the sheriff that she\u0027s his sister-in-law who has mental issues. The sheriff tells him to shut up and asks Hayley to explain and when she does, laughs because the doctor who owns the mansion would never hurt anyone.   Still, he indulges Hayley and asks her to come with him to investigate the mansion because it\u0027s ridiculous that the doctor would want to eat anyone.Sebastian too is put in the backseat. Hayley has her reservations and is right when she doesn\u0027t want to get off the car. The sheriff manages to convince her and of course, her instincts are right. The sheriff is in on it as well and chides the hosts for doing such a shabby job binding, Hayley. He tells them to use the handcuffs.Hayley tries to make a run for it but is restrained easily. She is made to sit at the table while everyone feasts on Jeff. They relish every bite while Sadie appears and recites an incantation, snowing no modesty. She performs a ritual on Hayley who is tied up with scarves again.She suffers a seizure and suddenly gets violent. She breaks free from her binds and begins attacking everyone.   Sadie seems to be helping her as well.   In the end, it is only Sebastian left who is drinking the twelve- dollar bottled wine the couple brought when they arrived. He explains the story of his favorite opera the Pagliacci and then he too is murdered by Hayley the same way her husband was killed.All that is left is Sadie. She says to Hayley that she could chose her path. Hayley shoots Sadie twice and both shots hit her chest and though blood initially appears on her chest Sadie brushes them off and she\u0027s healed!!   She shows Hayley the tarot cards they had picked before and that even though she picked the death card, she was reminded it could also mean a new beginning for her.   Hayley wants to know who Sadie is and if she\u0027s the devil. Sadie laughs and says no as he eyes change shape and color.   Hayley picks another card and sees Adam and Eve. She asks Sadie if she\u0027s the first woman to which Sadie agrees. She explains she was never expelled from paradise but left of her own free will. She said she\u0027s always been looking for love and that she knows Hayley didn\u0027t just witness her parent\u0027s death but caused them.   She asks Hayley to join her and always be by her side forever. Hayley agrees with a kiss.Later on, a couple is seen walking to the mansion and nervous about meeting the couple who is well connected and will help their careers.   Hayley invites them and is wearing the same mask Sebastian was in the beginning. It is implied that they are going to do the same ritual that was done on Hayley and Jeff.(thanks to darkhorrortales blogspot)","Weighted Degree":"2.0","numvotes":"7485","productioncompany":"Artist Vodka Films","countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"5.0","originaltitle":"The Dinner Party","size":"1","genres":"Horror,Thriller","storyline":"A budding playwright and his wife attend a dinner party hosted by wealthy, cultural elites, who have promised to bankroll the writer\u0027s latest play to Broadway, but, in fact, have darker designs in mind for the couple.","Clustering Coefficient":"0.0","genre":"Thriller","Number of triangles":"0"},"color":"rgb(115,91,74)","size":36.39344024658203},{"label":"Lips of Blood","x":507.99444580078125,"y":1722.5584716796875,"id":"tt0073324","attributes":{"notes":"Mad scientist elements; Queer cinema","year":"1975","runtimeminutes":"88","synopsis":"Ever since his father died, Frederic [Jean-Loup Philippe] has been unable to remember   anything about his childhood, even though his mother has told him all   about it. One night, while at a party, Frederic notices a photograph of   some castle ruins near a beach. They look familiar to him, and he recalls   an incident that happened 20 years ago, when he was 12. He was lost. It   was getting dark, and he went to the castle where he was invited in by a   young girl [Annie Briand] dressed all in white. He spent the night there and became   infatuated with her. To thank her for her kindness, Frederic placed a toy   on her steps before he left to go home.When Frederic tells his mother [Natalie Perrey] about the memory, she denies that it   ever happened, so Frederic pays a visit to the photographer to find out   where the photo was taken. The photographer tells him that she\u0027s been paid   not to reveal the location but later relents and tells him to meet her at   midnight at the aquarium and she will tell him then. To kill time,   Frederic goes to the cinema. As he watches the movie, he notices the girl   in white standing in the doorway. He follows her outside. She leads him   into a cemetery and down into a crypt where he finds four coffins. He   opens one of the coffins to find several bats inside.Unknowingly, Frederic has released four vampiresses. Frederic runs   outside where he meets a woman who claims to be the girl he met 20 years   ago in the ruins, even though she looks nothing like her. She leads him to   a room in an old abandoned building. When he asks her to identify the toy   that he left with her 20 years ago, she cannot, confirming Frederic\u0027s   suspicion that she is working for the same people that paid the   photographer to keep quiet. For some reason, they do not want him to find   the girl. Suddenly, the woman bolts from the room, locking the door behind   her. While the girl in white watches, two of the vampiresses unlock the   door and release Frederic.It is now midnight, and Frederic goes to the aquarium where he finds   that the photographer has been murdered. A man with a briefcase walks   past, and Frederic follows him into the Metro. When the man pulls a gun on   him, Frederic kicks the gun from his hand, pulls the cord to stop the   train, and runs away. The man follows, cornering Frederic on a balcony.   Meanwhile, the two vampires throw a switch that turns on myriad fountains,   which afford Frederic with cover, and he is able to escape.Frederic tells his mother about seeing the girl in white. She tries   to convince him that he is mad and, while Frederic is changing clothes,   she calls the hospital. When Frederic leaves the house, he is immediately   captured by two ambulance drivers and taken to the hospital where he is   placed in a straitjacket and told that he is going to receive electroshock   therapy. While pacing in his room, Frederic sees the girl in white. He   begs her to speak to him if she truly exists, and she mouths the words \"Je   t\u0027aime\". Then she disappears. Two nurses come to take Frederic to the   psychiatrist, but they turn out to be the two vampires. Instead, they   attack the psychiatrist, untie the straitjacket, and allow Frederick to   escape.While running down the street, Frederic sees a blind man selling   postcards of the ruins, so he buys one and learns that it is called   Sauveterre Castle. Certain that the girl in white is calling for his help,   Frederic catches the train to Sauveterre. It is just as he remembers it.   He even finds the toy that he left lying on the castle steps. He walks   through the castle looking for the girl. Eventually, he comes upon a room   where he finds books, dolls, toys, candles, a coffin, and a picture album   with his picture in it. Just as Frederic attempts to open the coffin, his   mother appears.She tells him the story of the girl in white. Her name is Jennifer,   and she\u0027s a vampire. Jennifer was imprisoned in Sauveterre Castle when she   was 16 in order to prevent the vampire curse from spreading. It was   Jennifer who killed Frederic\u0027s father. The corpses of the four vampires   freed by Frederic were moved to the abandoned vault in Paris. While three   men track down and stake the four vampires and build a bonfire to burn   their bodies, Frederic\u0027s mother sends him back into the castle with orders   to kill Jennifer and bring her head. But Frederic cannot do it and,   instead, brings the head of a statue which he tosses into the bonfire.After everyone leaves, Frederic returns to the castle and awakens   Jennifer. She tells him how she learned to project her sight and then her   spirit while she lay in her coffin waiting for Frederic to come. He allows   her to turn him into a vampire, and they both get into her coffin and let   the tide carry them out to sea.

He invites her in and he removes his make-up. She explains how much everyone loves him and asks if she may do something. He accepts and she takes his hand and places it between her legs. He pulls his hand away. She leaves in a hurry, saying how foolish she\u0027s been.As he loads his van, a woman (possibly the manager of the old-folks home, it\u0027s not clear) insists on a hug before he leaves. He does so, but the old woman from the dressing room appears at a window, so brushes her off before having trouble starting his van.He drives through the countryside on a main road and onto progressively narrower roads ending up on a track through some misty woods. He stops to check a map and sees a sign indicating \"Bartel Inn, 3km\". Continuing slowly through the heavy rain and the dark, a shadow runs in front of the van, he brakes suddenly and the engine stalls. The van will not restart. He checks under the bonnet and returns to the driver\u0027s seat to take his mobile telephone out of the glovebox. The pale face of a young man (Jean-Luc Couchard) appears at the window and asks where his dog, \"Bella\", is. Marc indicates the direction that the shadow moved. The young man heads off, but Marc calls him back and asks to be guided to the inn. They leave the van. As they head off, the young man, Boris, asks him to be quiet so he can listen out for Bella.Boris takes him to the inn and calls up to the owner, M.Bartel (Jackie Berroyer). When the old man\u0027s face appears at the window, Boris says that he has brought someone to stay then runs off into the night. M.Bartel says that nobody has stayed in ages, but the rooms are clean.The next morning, Marc is woken by the sound of a tractor. He looks out of the window of his room to see his van being towed into the courtyard. M.Bartel greets him as Marc comes outside. He offers to take a look at the van for him. Bartel explains that he used to be a comedian. Marc takes out his mobile phone but it appears not to be working. Bartel takes an interest in it. Marc asks to use Bartel\u0027s phone. Bartel makes a call to the local mechanic and appears to speak to the mechanic\u0027s wife. There will be a delay. Bartel makes a meal for Marc. Later, Marc sees Bartel working on his van. Marc offers to help, but Bartel says he\u0027ll be fine. Marc says he\u0027s going for a walk. Bartel warns him to stay away from the village. Marc asks why, but Martel stumbles over his words.Whilst Marc is out, Bartel breaks into the back of the van and takes a look at Marc possessions, ending up in the glovebox. He takes Marc\u0027s mobile phone. He comes across some documents and photographs in a jacket pocket. Some show a woman with an unbuttoned blouse with captions including \"come back soon\", \"I\u0027m pining for you\". It appears to be the woman who hugged him at the beginning of the film.On his walk, Marc comes across a ramshackle barn. As he gets closer, he can hear voices. He then sees a group of men who are encouraging a younger man to have sex with a pig. Unseen by the men, Marc watches for a while before heading away.Returning to the inn, Bartel is on the telephone and in conversation with the mechanic\u0027s wife. There will be a further delay in getting a replacement battery for the van. Marc heads outside to investigate for himself, but Bartel persuades him not to try the van.Bartel cooks a meal and as Marc eats, talks about his wife (\"Gloria\") who left him and how he is unable to tell jokes like he used to. He tells one, but it lacks enthusiasm. He then asks Marc to sing. Marc says he is tired and sings half a song half-heartedly. Bartel insists he finish. Marc completes the song with more gusto. He asks for a wake-up call the next morning and Bartel thanks him for the song.Marc wakes the next morning and it\u0027s already light. Bartel is nowhere to be found. Boris appears and is no wiser about where Bartel is. Marc checks the van and discovers that the battery has been removed. He goes back inside to make a telephone call but discovers that the line is dead. In fact, it\u0027s not even wired up!Something attracts he attention to the building across the courtyard. He enters the shabby room and looks around, finding his phone and the photos of the woman on a table. Bartel enters, somewhat annoyed. He says he\u0027d found the phone on the dinner table last night and was going to return it (this does not explain the photos, of course).Marc goes up to his room and finds it immaculate, but there are a woman\u0027s frocks in the wardrobe. He is distracted by smashing noises from outside. Bartel is taking a sledgehammer to his van. Marc goes back outside to find Bartel splashing petrol on the van. Bartel drops his matches, but as Marc remonstrates with him, Bartel asks why she came back, as if speaking to his wife and picks up the battery and slugs Marc with it. He then torches the van. Bartel drags Marc\u0027s unconscious body upstairs and dresses him in his wife\u0027s clothes. Next, Marc is struggling, tied to a chair and Bartel is using hand clippers to remove Marc\u0027s hair. He succeeds in cropping most of one side. That night, Marc is tied to the bed whilst Bartel prepares for bed. In underpants and a grubby vest, Bartel curls up next to Marc.The next morning, Marc is sat on the back of the tractor hitch wearing a dress and a windcheater jacket. Bartel is searching for an axe and talking about what a great Christmas they are going to have. In the forest, Bartel chops down a tree. Marc decides to make a run for it. When Bartel looks around again, Marc is gone. Curses!Marc runs some distance but gets caught in a snare. He falls on his face. With hands tied, he\u0027s stuck. At night, Bartel drives through the forest, calling out his wife\u0027s name. In the dark, torchlight finds Marc. It\u0027s Boris. Boris pets Marc\u0027s head like a dog\u0027s as Marc pleads to be untied. Marc bites Boris\u0027 thigh and Boris runs off. At first light, Boris removes the snare and drags Marc onto... ... Bartel\u0027s trailer. Two of the villagers, Robert Orton (Philippe Nahon) and his son Tomas Orton (Philippe Grand\u0027Henry), see Bartel\u0027s tractor passing through the forest with Marc\u0027s unconscious body laid out. They watch at the door to Bartel\u0027s barn as Marc\u0027s wrists are nailed to a beam like a crucifix. Bartel realises somebody is outside. He shouts that he knows what \u0027Gloria\u0027 has been up to.Bartel passes some children (Borhan Du Welz, Maxime Dewitte, Alexis Dewitte, Liam Gilson, Raphaël Schmidt, Eliot Cahay and Farkhad Alekperov) in red hooded coats in the woods(!?!)Bartel goes to the village pub, and warns them to stay away from his place. It seems everyone knows what he is up to. He confronts the villager Robert and leaves saying, \"it\u0027s my wife\". One of the villagers (Vincent Cahay) takes to the piano, playing a dischordant dirge which turns into a frenzied beat. The villagers (Romain Protat, Damien Waselle, Viktor Mikol, Nedzad Kurtagic and Yves Vaucher) in the pub begin to dance a strange swaying dance to the music.Back at the inn, Bartel explains how he and \u0027Gloria\u0027 are going to reopen the inn with cabaret. There is a knock at the door. Boris has found his dog. The dog turns out to be a calf. Marc begins to wail. The room spins, picking out the faces of Bartel, Boris and Marc. Marc is going mad.A shot rings out and Boris spits blood, falling to the floor. Bartel picks out his rifle and smashes the lights out. Marc calls for help so Bartel clouts him with the butt of the gun. Shots ring out and in a dazed state, we see some of the villagers break in. Marc picks up an ornament to knock out Bartel, but Bartel is shot. The door is kicked through and a squealing pig is followed by Robert, Tomas and other villagers. Tomas picks up the calf and asks to leave, but Robert demands a song from Marc. The villagers join in the demand. Robert speaks to Marc as if he is Gloria, asking why she came back. One villager tries to rape Marc. In the mayhem that ensues, more shots ring out. Bartel and Boris are killed. Marc sneaks out. The villagers regroup outside the inn and use the pig as a bloodhound to track Marc\u0027s escape.The group persues Marc through rivers and woods. In the misty marsh, the pig and villagers give up, but Robert continues alone. Marc comes across a statue of Christ on the cross. Robert eventually catches sight of Marc in the boggy marshland. The chase continues at a snail\u0027s pace. Robert falls into soft peat and begins to sink in the bog.He calls out to Marc, who turns back. \"Why did you come back Gloria? You love me, don\u0027t you? Say it\". Kneeling by the hole, Marc replies \"I loved you\".We watch the frozen Belgian countryside shrouded in mist pass by.

Brock\u0027s spontaneous poetry recital. Despite the poet\u0027s open disdain for his simplistic, gullible nature, Walter clings to Maxwell\u0027s words and admires his associates, especially sketch artist Carla (Barbour Morris). Unknown to the customers and Yellow Door owner Leonard De Santis, two undercover police officers, Art Lacroix and Lou Raby, take turns staking out the café for possible drug deals.After his shift ends, Walter returns to his small apartment frustrated over his inability to convince the Yellow Door patrons of his artistic potential. When his attempt at sculpting proves futile, Walter lashes out angrily at his landlady\u0027s cat and accidentally kills the animal. At first horrified, Walter then covers the cat\u0027s body with clay and the next day presents it to Leonard and Carla as a work of art.Amazed by the realistic quality of the \"sculpture,\" Leonard displays the cat in the café and that evening Walter is showered with praise by the Yellow Door regulars, including Maxwell. One customer, Naolia, is so moved by the work that she offers Walter a small vial as a gift. Lou notices the exchange and, following Walter home, asks to see the vial and discovers it contains heroin. Walter is surprised and confused when Lou reveals his identity and demands to know the name of his dealer. Frightened when Lou pulls a gun and places him under arrest, Walter lashes out with a frying pan, splitting Lou\u0027s skull. Meanwhile at the café, Leonard is closing up when he accidentally knocks over Walter\u0027s cat sculpture and to his horror, discovers fur underneath the clay.The next afternoon when Walter returns to work, Leonard makes sarcastic remarks to him about his artistic talent, but Carla and Maxwell come to his defense. Emboldened, Walter reveals he has a new work to show them, entitled \"Murdered Man,\" which stuns Leonard. On his way to telephone the authorities, however, Leonard is approached by a wealthy art collector who offers five hundred dollars for the cat sculpture. Leonard warily agrees, then later goes with Carla to Walter\u0027s apartment to see the new work, which is Lou\u0027s body covered with clay. Shocked, Leonard refuses to display the work at the Yellow Door, but when Carla and Walter express puzzlement, Leonard suggests Walter make other pieces in order to put together a show. The distressed café owner encourages Walter to move away from realism and try \"free form\" art, then pays him fifty dollars from the cat sculpture sale.Ecstatic by his newfound success, Walter ceases working at the Yellow Door, and, affecting a beatnik style, becomes one of the café\u0027s customers, where he joins Maxwell\u0027s table of artists. One afternoon soon after Walter\u0027s initial success, Alice, a part-time model who has been out of town, joins the group but is critical of Walter, whom she knows only as a busboy. Offended by Alice\u0027s put-downs, Walter departs, but later follows her home to ask her to pose for him. Alice agrees and goes to Walter\u0027s apartment, where he strangles her with a scarf, then makes another \"sculpture\" that he takes to the café the next day.Profoundly affected by Walter\u0027s abilities, Maxwell delivers a poetic homage to him that night at the Yellow Door. After a drunken, boisterous night of acclaim, Walter heads for home, but grows frightened at the notion that his fame might be short-lived. Spotting a man cutting wood at a lumber mill, Walter attacks the man and cuts his head off with a large table saw. The next day, Leonard is mortified when Walter brings in his newest work, the bust of a man, and pleads with him to stop sculpting, declaring they have enough pieces for a show. Walter agrees and Leonard sends out invitations for his exhibition.On the night of the show, Walter takes Carla aside and proposes, but Carla insists that while she admires Walter\u0027s works, she is not in love with him. Angered and hurt, Walter asks Carla if she will pose for him later and she agrees. At the show, Walter, distressed over Carla\u0027s rejection, ignores the renowned art critics admiring his work. A little later, Carla closely examines Alice\u0027s sculpture and is terrified when some melting clay reveals a real finger. Carla confronts Walter who quotes Maxwell\u0027s poetry and insists he has only immortalized worthless people. Appalled, Carla flees from the café and Walter follows. Meanwhile, Art has also examined some sculptures and, realizing they are dead bodies, pursues Walter. Maxwell and several of his friends also discover the truth behind the sculptures and run after Walter.Haunted by the voices of his victims who assure him that he will be reviled now that he has been discovered, Walter abandons chasing Carla and instead rushes home in fright. When Art, Maxwell, Carla and the others arrive at the apartment, they find that Walter has hanged himself in despair.","Weighted Degree":"12.0","numvotes":"6798","productioncompany":"Alta Vista Productions","countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"6.7","originaltitle":"A Bucket of Blood","size":"3","genres":"Comedy,Crime,Horror","storyline":"Walter Paisley, nerdy busboy at a Bohemian café, is jealous of the talent (and popularity) of its various artistic regulars.

The Director\u0027s cut runs 14 minutes longer and this synopsis caters for both versions.A thunderstorm filled, rainy night in the small town of Fairwater. A woman called Patricia Bradley (Dee Wallace) is been chased by a mysterious entity around the old-looking house in which she lives with her mother (Julianna Mcarthy). Patricia is screaming and fearing for her life. Her mother appears from her bedroom with a pump action shotgun and shoots the mysterious figure as its shape appears through the carpet at the top of the stairs.Some of the residents of Fairwater are gathering for a funeral in the community as the local newspaper editor Magda Rees Jones (Elizabeth Hawthorne) and her assistant are reporting the story of another seemingly innocent death amongst the residents. Psychic investigator Frank Bannister (Michael Andrew Fox) arrives at the funeral trying desperately to advertise his services. As he leaves in his wrecked and dirty looking Volkswagen, his reckless driving causes him to nearly hit an on-coming truck. As he swerves to miss it, he crashes straight through a garden fence. Ray Lynskey (Peter Dobson) comes out of his house infuriated and threatens to sue him for the damages. Frank gives him his business card and drives off after deliberately driving over one of Ray\u0027s garden gnomes.On the other side of town Ray\u0027s wife Doctor Lucy Lynskey (Trini Alvarado), visits the Bradley house to treat Patricia\u0027s cuts. She bandages her hand and tells her that she needs to take her to hospital but her mother (Julianna McCarthy) refuses to let her go. She tells her that she never leaves the house and to just give her some antibiotics. Lucy notices how timid and fragile Patricia is and as she gets ready to leave, she notices some bruising around her neck. Patricia\u0027s mother rushes Lucy out of the house and tells her that her daughter is not to be trusted. She was involved in cold-blooded murder.Becoming intrigued by Patricia\u0027s history, Lucy watches a documentary about the notorious serial killer Johnny Bartlett (Jake Busey).\"In the space of 27 blood-soaked minutes, 12 innocent people gunned down by hospital orderly John Charles Bartlett. Patients, medical staff, visitors, no one was spared in this madman\u0027s rampage through Fairwater Sanatorium.Not even the hospital chapel provided sanctuary,as those in prayer were gunned down on their knees. A seemingly senseless crime, Bartlett\u0027s motive remains a mystery to this day. Six years earlier Charles Starkweather had murdered 11 people in a Nebraska killing spree\".The black and white footage shows the horrific scenes at the hospital of the victims and the families, as well as the footage of Bartlett being escorted to court by the police boasting about his disgusting act.\"Fifteen year-old Patricia Ann Bradley, daughter of the hospital administrator, was also implicated in the killings. She was madly in love with the psychopath Bartlett. 2,200 volts of electricity ended the life of Johnny Bartlett, the unrepented killer. As they threw the switch he was heard to scream: I got me a score of twelve. Beat that!\" In what some consider a miscarriage of justice, Patricia Ann Bradley was sentenced to life imprisonment although it was never proven that she actively participated in the killings.

It hovers up in the air as the couple panic. Objects start flying everywhere in the kitchen.Lucy calls Frank and he arrives to rid the house of the supernatural. Instead of charging the couple,he offers to do it in return for not having to pay for the damaged fence.Ray reluctantly agrees and Frank uses his \"equipment\" to capture the spooks and pours them down the sink. As he is packing his stuff up,he is shocked to see a glowing number 37 on Ray\u0027s forehead. Lucy cannot see this and Ray kicks Frank out of the house.Frank arrives at his home to his half-built house that he hasn\u0027t finished working on. As he gets out of is car,a spirit exits the trunk - a young, 1950\u0027s nerd called Stuart (Jim Fyfe), followed by a 1970\u0027s, afro-haired ghost called Cyrus (Chi Mcbride). The ghosts are Frank\u0027s associates who help him con the local residents by haunting their homes, so that Frank can step in and reap the rewards. While Stuart is just about to join them in the house, Frank closes the door and he gets stuck because his ectoplasm has become too stiff. Frank asks them if they had anything to do with the glowing number appearing on Ray\u0027s head but the spirits don\u0027t know what he\u0027s talking about.(Director\u0027s cut) Cyrus helps pull Stuart through the door.

As they are talking, gunshots go off, as another spirit, a judge from the 1800\u0027s (John Astin) enters the room trying to shoot the ghost dog Rhustler as he gnaws on his jawbone. Frank gets his jaw back and tells him to put his guns away.(Director\u0027s cut) Frank cuts some wood off from the roof of his house for his fireplace.He sits looking through the newspaper, trying to find people that have recently lost family, while The Judge contemplates going off into the graveyard to rest his decrepit body.

The figure moves in close to him but it is only Cyrus and Stuart underneath a cape. They tell him they are trying to figure out different ways to scare people but Frank isn\u0027t amused and walks off angry. The next morning Frank receives a letter from his bank informing him that he owes $16,000 dollars. He needs some money fast and he calls the spirits for a meeting demanding that they up their antics to really frighten people.Cyrus and Stuart arrive at a rich woman\u0027s house and start causing fear by picking up the resident\u0027s babies and scaring the mother and her maid as they see the babies hovering through the air. Again they leave one of Frank\u0027s business cards. Frank gets the phone call and sets off.(Director\u0027s cut) Frank is trying to drive to the house as fast as he can but he keeps getting stuck in traffic because the roads are blocked with funeral cars. The Judge is sat in the passenger\u0027s seat and tells him that there is something very sinister dawning over Fairwater. But Frank isn\u0027t interested in what he\u0027s saying.He impatiently and recklessly pulls out into the line of funeral cars and dodges around the traffic. He pulls up outside the house and tells Judge to wait for him.Frank walks into the house and attempts to pull off his scheme but the woman is not interested. She has in her hand the local newspaper which shows a picture of Frank with the headline \"Local conman haunts cemetery\". Frank is angry. He confronts Magda Rees Jones at the local Gazette about printing the story but she tells him he is a parasite who makes money off of the bereaved and she has every right to let people know about him. He leaves and he sees that another funeral is taking place.He sees Lucy in one of the cars crying. As he walks off down the street he is shocked to see Ray running towards him. But not in human form. Ray is now dead. His spirit runs straight into him. Ray is panicking and can\u0027t understand how he\u0027s died so young and fit. He tells Frank that just before he died he felt his heart been crushed while he was working out. Frank tries to explain the rules of the afterlife to him. Ray asks Frank to give him a ride to his funeral.(Director\u0027s cut) As Frank pulls up to the graveyard in his car, Ray (not yet used to being a spirit) has trouble grabbing hold of the door handle to get out. Frank pushes him through the car door and he lands on the ground.They walk through the graveyard and Ray is petrified as he witnesses many spirits roaming the grounds. Drill Sergeant Hiles (R.Lee Ermey), the watchful spirit of the other ghosts, walks out of his tomb and orders the ghosts to get back in their graves. Frank knows there will be trouble. He tells Ray to go on ahead while he talks to the angry sergeant. The two have a fight but with Hiles\u0027s supernatural abilities, Frank has no chance.While Hiles shouts to tell the inhbitants of the graveyard who\u0027s in charge, Frank goes off to join Ray at his funeral. As Ray becomes very emotional at his tragic death, he falls into the grave as he tries to put his arms around Lucy. He is horrified as he lays on top of his own corpse. As the mourners start to leave the graveside,sheriff Walt Perry (Troy Evans) arrives to talk to Frank. Apart from Lucy, he was the last person to see Ray alive and he wants to know what condition he seemed to be in when he saw him. He says that the FBI are becoming very concerned about the amount of deaths that are happening in the town - many of the victims are healthy and have clean arteries when the autopsy has taken place but their hearts look as though they have been squeezed. Frank tries to get rid of Walt by pretending that he wants to pay his respects to Ray, in order to pull Ray\u0027s spirit out of his grave. Walt is alarmed to see Frank physically grappling with thin air and seemingly talking to nothing. As Frank and Ray get ready to leave, an emotional Lucy approaches and tells Frank that she believes in his paranormal gifts. He tells her that he has in fact communicated with Ray.Frank has dinner with Lucy and the deceased Ray at the Excalibur themed restaurant and acts as a communicator between the two of them. But Ray becomes increasingly frustrated as his wife seems to start bonding with Frank throughout the evening. She asks him why he can see spirits and Frank tells her that he was in a car accident five years earlier and sometimes a traumatic experience can alter a person\u0027s perception. Lucy opens up too. She tells Frank that her and Ray\u0027s marriage was not a happy one and just as Frank tries to console her by grabbing her hand, Ray angrily knocks over a glass of wine into Frank\u0027s lap. Thrilled that he can now use make physical contact with the real world, Ray threatens Frank and disappears. Frank goes to the bathroom to dry his trousers. A man enters and Frank is shocked to once again see a glowing number on the man\u0027s head reading 38. Frank becomes increasingly edgy as he sees The Grim Reaper figure appear and kill the man by reaching into his chest and squeezing his heart. The man\u0027s corpse drops to the floor and Frank watches as the gateway to Heaven opens up and the man\u0027s spirit goes off to the other side. Frank rushes out of the restaurant and pursues The Reaper.Lucy is escorted to the Sheriff\u0027s office by one of Sheriff Perry\u0027s deputies as a witness to the situation. Walt is told that witnesses saw Frank rushing out of the restaurant before the dead man was found. He tells his men to bring Frank in.Frank chases the Reaper in his car with Stuart, Cyrus and The Judge. He tries his best to kill it but his car just goes straight through the caped figure and it once again eludes him.FBI agent Milton Dammers (Jeffrey Combs) arrives at the Sheriff\u0027s office to meet Walt and Lucy. He believes that Frank is behind the killings. He tells them about the incident that happened five years earlier when Frank and his wife had the car crash. They discovered that Debra\u0027s dead body was found 15 yards from the car with a number 13 carved in her forehead and after the body was found, Frank was picked up wandering the forest claiming to have no recollection of the incident.Frank tracks down The Reaper at the museum where the 39th life has been taken. Frank sees on Magda Reese-Jones\u0027s forehead a number 40 glowing. She is going to be the next target. He tries to warn her but two deputy sheriffs arrive to arrest him. The Reaper appears but the officers have their guns pointed at Frank. The Judge appears and shoots The Reaper and it disappears. Cyrus and Stuart start to make people scared in the museum in order to cause a diversion for Frank to get away. In the commotion, Frank punches Magda and knocks her out, in order to carry her out to his car to safety. He drives away but The Reaper is in pursuit and forces Frank to crash his car in the vicinity where Debra died years earlier. Magda crawls from the car trying to escape from Frank who she believes to be psychotic.

Frank jumps towards it but it disappears again and he is lying face down on her corpse. The gateway to Heaven opens and Magda\u0027s spirit jumps from her body and accuses of Frank of being a sick murderer who is responsible for her and his wife\u0027s death.Frank arrives at the sheriff\u0027s office and tells them what has happened. When Walt asks him if he had anything to do with Magda\u0027s death, he doesn\u0027t answer and he is arrested on suspicion of murder.

He can sense there is danger lurking inside. Patricia is at the top of the stairs and tells Lucy they need to hide. As her mother walks back in, the two of them rush into her bedroom. Lucy tells Patricia that she needs to get away and start a new life for herself. She sees an urn on the side. They are Patricia\u0027s father\u0027s ashes. He had killed himself after discovering that Patricia had been involved with a serial killer. She hears her mum coming up the stairs and tells Lucy to hide in the wardrobe.

But as he looks Lucy in the face, the number 41 glows on her forehead. He realises she is the next victim. The Reaper appears through the cell door and tries to kill her. With the help of Stuart and Cyrus, he tries to protect her in the confines of the cell. Lucy shouts for the deputy to come and unlock the door. Stuart is dissolved by the Reaper\u0027s sythe. As Frank hears the cell door unlock, he kicks the door into the deputy\u0027s head and knocks him out, so that he can escape with Lucy. Dammers walks around the corner and draws his gun. Lucy rushes up to him and tells him that Frank is crazy, as Cyrus battles the Reaper. Lucy uses a fire extinguisher to spray at Dammers to protect Frank. Cyrus\u0027s soul is taken by the Reaper and Frank takes Dammers\u0027s gun and runs out of the precinct with Lucy. He tells her that he must kill himself in order to become a spirit and protect her. He is ready to put a bullet in his head, but she tells him not to and instead helps him have a near death experience by means of hypothermia and using barbiturates to slow his heart rate.At the medical centre, Frank goes to sit in the cryogenics room and waits to slowly die as Lucy gets the equipment prepared to revive him within several minutes. But Dammers appears in the room armed with an uzi machine gun. He thinks Frank deserves to die for his supposed crimes and abducts Lucy to stop her from reviving him. Frank\u0027s spirit emerges from his dead body and the gateway to Heaven opens for him but he walks away to try and find Lucy. Dammers handcuffs Lucy in the back of one of the sheriff\u0027s cars and drives off. Frank pursues them.

She shouts at him and he starts to freak out again.(Director\u0027s cut) As he tries to cover his ears with his hands, Lucy notices one of his wrists the swastika sign.

All of the weird cults and sects he has had to be involved in, including drinking goat\u0027s blood. He says that he has suffered for his country.He says that the pain he has suffered in the different religious groups has its rewards and tries to prove that he has some psychic sensibilities. He and Lucy are both shocked as the car engine starts up. The gear stick and steering wheel move and Lucy knows that it\u0027s Frank. Frank starts to reverse the car away from Dammers as Dammers chases after it. Sergeant Hiles reaches in through the car window to grab Frank and throws him to the ground. The car crashes into a sarcophagus and coffins fall out. The Reaper approaches and slices Hiles in half with its scythe. Frank uses the sergeant\u0027s machine guns to shoot it. Lucy gets out of the car to get into the driver\u0027s seat and Dammers jumps out to grab her.She uses the skull from a skeleton to hit him and quickly gets in the car and drives off. While Dammers chases after her, Frank rips the Reaper apart with the bullets and turns it into pieces ectoplasm. He grabs the face of the Reaper and as he slams it down onto a grave a few times, the face gradually morphs into a human face and reveals itself to be Johnny Bartlett. He has returned from beyond the grave to continue his killing spree. Spirits start wandering around in the vicinity, all of who appear to be Johnny\u0027s victims satisfied that their deaths have been avenged. A spirit with the number 1 carved in his head approaches Frank and tells him he was a doctor and the first of the victims. He thanks Frank for what he\u0027s done. But while Frank is distracted, the pieces of Johnny\u0027s ectoplasm start to drip down into a tomb and gradually morph back together. Frank dives down into the ground and wrestles with him. He picks up the scythe and as he brings down the handle onto the ectoplasmic figure, Johnny\u0027s full human formed spirit is revealed.

She tells Lucy she knows and that his spirit often visits her. As Lucy stands in the doorway of the living room, Johnny appears behind her threatening to kill her. He says that she and Frank have been causing a lot of problems. Patricia goes to the kitchen and Johnny points to the knives on the wall. He wants to watch her kill Lucy.(Director\u0027s cut) Patricia repeatedly stabs the knife through Johnny\u0027s torso as they both laugh and become increasingly excited by it, almost in an arousing way.Lucy goes upstairs to see if Mrs Bradley is going with them. She sees her bedroom door open a jar and when she opens it she is horrified to see the old lady\u0027s dead body spread out on the bed covered in blood. Patricia pops up behind her and tries to stab her. Lucy tries to shut the door and the blade of the knife goes into it. Lucy punches her and they both grapple to the floor. Lucy gets up and runs out of the door, after she gets the key out of the lock and locks it from the outside. She sits on the landing stairs trying to get over the shock but bullets start exploding through the door. Patricia has got hold of her mother\u0027s pump action shotgun. Lucy tries to run down the stairs but Johnny\u0027s figure appears from under he rug and tries to strangle her. Frank arrives in time to save Lucy. He grabs hold of the rug and throws Johnny off of the landing. Patricia gets out of the bedroom firing at them maniacally. Frank and Lucy get into Patricia\u0027s bedroom and Johnny appears in the room through the portrait of her father. He tries to kill Lucy once again but Frank smashes the portrait onto the bed post and Johnny\u0027s spirit cries out as he is sucked into the urn on the bedside table. Frank puts the lid on and sees Johnny\u0027s name on the urn. He tells Lucy that they need to get to a chapel and get the ashes to the \"other side\". Realising that there\u0027s a chapel in the old psychiatric (now derelict) hospital, which is located just behind the Bradley house, the pair head off there on foot.They make their way into the murky looking building and walk through the hallways looking for the chapel. Patricia follows them armed. As Frank looks around, he starts to have psychic episodes where he is able to see the events that transpired on the fateful day when Johnny and Patricia went on their killing spree. He sees Johnny pushing a trolley around and he uncovers a gun and blows away the doctor who thanked Frank in the graveyard. He sees the teenage Patricia walking around with a knife ready to carve into the victims\u0027 foreheads. Through his flashbacks, Frank hears one of the doctors say that the chapel is on the fourth floor.Still believing Frank to be the murderer, Dammers enters the hospital. Frank and Lucy are forced to split up when Patricia appears in the hallways and starts shooting at them both again. Lucy has the urn but Dammers gets hold of her and throws her head into the wall. Lucy punches him and gets away from him and manages to get into the elevator before he can reach her. She starts going up to the fourth floor but it breaks down. Frank is still running upstairs and comes across the chapel. He hears Lucy cry. He tries to pry the elevator door open to no avail but she manages to pass him the urn through the door to take to the chapel.Frank puts the urn down to smash the door in but as he turns around he bumps into a statue of the Virgin Mary and it falls onto the table and sends the urn flying to the other side of the hall. Dammers catches it. Frank angrily and desperately asks for it back but Dammers opens it and releases Johnny\u0027s ashes. His spirit laughs as the dust breezes away. Frank picks up a metal bar ready to give Dammers a beating but Dammers pulls out a machine gun and shoots him in the arm. Facing away from him and holding his bloody arm, Frank sees Patricia walk around the corner in the distance ready to shoot him with the shotgun. Dammers orders him to turn around. Frank does and falls backwards as Patricia fires and the bullet blows Dammers\u0027s head off. Frank crashes through four wooden floors down onto the ground floor. Patricia starts to shoot at Lucy in the elevator. She avoids the bullets,and the elevator starts automatically going again. Bloodied, bruised and half unconscious, Frank starts to crawl along the floor of the vivisection room.(Director\u0027s cut) In his psychic flashbacks, Frank sees Johnny chasing the teenage Patricia around dead bodies as she screams \"please don\u0027t hurt me\". As they have a playful game of chase, covered in blood. He grabs her and they start making out on the coroner\u0027s trolley.Lucy makes it to the ground floor and rushes to Frank. But Frank is nearly unconscious. Patricia appears behind her and hits her over the head with the butt of the gun. Frank flashes back to the moment when his wife Debra died and he finally remembers exactly what happened in that moment. He sees The Reaper transform into Johnny as he\u0027s stood over his wife\u0027s body and Patricia is holding his Stanley knife.Patricia points the shotgun at Frank, ready to kill him but she is out of bullets. She kicks him and lifts him up off of the floor with the gun around his neck. Lucy tries to help but Johnny is pinning her down. Frank struggles with Patricia but Patricia has the advantage and she strangles him to death. Frank\u0027s dead body drops to the floor, as Lucy cries out. Johnny excitedly waits for Patricia to take Lucy\u0027s life as well. She picks up an axe from the vivisection area ready but Frank\u0027s spirit jumps out at her and rips Patricia\u0027s spirit from her body and takes her through the tunnel to the \"other side\". Johnny chases him up through the tunnel of light, and as they get half way through, he manages to pull her away from Frank\u0027s grasp. Frank carries on floating towards Heaven, as Johnny and Patricia stay hovering in the middle of the tunnel. He shouts to Frank that they\u0027re returning to Earth to get some more victims. Frank is just about to leap down after them but a voice stops him. It\u0027s Cyrus with Stuart. Frank looks down at Johnny and Patricia as their laughing turns to fear and panic. The spiritual looking, electric like portal gradually turns into the inside of a huge worm, with dozens and dozens of smaller worms wrapping themselves around them,strangling them and gouging out their eyes. The huge worm swallows them up and takes them down into the burning flames of Hell. Frank watches in disbelief and turns around to have a look around Heaven. Cyrus and Stuart tell him that it\u0027s really something. Frank sees his wife Debra approach him smiling. She tells him it\u0027s time to go home. The higher powers have said that it\u0027s not his time to die yet. Cyrus pushes him and he starts to float along the clouds. He wakes up in the derelict hospital in Lucy\u0027s arms.He demolishes his old house in order to start a new life with Lucy. Walt pulls up and tells Frank that the investigation is over. They found a stash of Ouija boards at the house and Patricia was using them to bring Johnny back from the dead. Her mother was trying to do her best to keep her sedated but there was no chance of her stopping Johnny. As Walt gets into his car and drives off, Frank sees the ghost of Dammers in the back seat. To his surprise Lucy can see him as well. She says to Frank \"sometimes when you\u0027ve had a traumatic experience it can alter your perception\". Then Lucy uses a blanket to imitate the Reaper and laughingly chases Frank as the movie ends.","Weighted Degree":"3.0","numvotes":"87002","productioncompany":"Universal Pictures","countriesoforigin":"New Zealand, United States","averagerating":"7.1","originaltitle":"The Frighteners","size":"1","genres":"Comedy,Fantasy,Horror","storyline":"After a car accident in which his wife, Debra, was killed and he was injured, Frank Bannister develops psychic abilities allowing him to see, hear, and communicate with ghosts.

However, Susan refuses to leave with Cora and runs back into the cemetery, where she discovers the Nomed mausoleum. As the gate springs open, she enters, finding herself surrounded by green fog and the sound of thunder. When a tramp wanders in behind her, Susan\u0027s eyes turn luminous green and a mysterious man in a robe hits the tramp with some kind of spell. The tramp staggers from the structure with smoke and flames emanating from his face, resulting his head exploding. Susan kneels before the tomb and touches it, causing the lid to open and a claw-like hand to reach out.Twenty years later, psychiatrist Dr. Simon Andrews (Norman Burton) assures Cora that her ongoing concerns about Susan (Bobbie Bresee) are unfounded. Cora counters by handing Simon her father\u0027s history of the Nomed family, which describes a 300-year-old family curse. Simon dismisses the story as superstition, ignoring Cora\u0027s insistence that she has witnessed similarly erratic behavior in both her late sister and her niece. Despite Simon\u0027s skepticism, he reads the book, which explains how a demon \"broke free of the crown of thorns\" and now possesses the body of the firstborn daughter to each generation of Nomeds. It also states that the demon can only be cast out by reuniting it with the crown of thorns, which adorns the gate of the mausoleum.That evening, Susan\u0027s husband, Oliver Farrell (Marjoe Gortner), awakens her from a nap and offers to take her dancing to a nightclub, as their gardener, Ben (Maurice Sherbanee), watches with interest through a window. Shortly after arriving at the nightclub, Oliver is called back to his office, and the couple is followed to the exit by a drunken man, who is enamored by Susan. Offended by the man\u0027s rudeness, Susan follows him with her glowing green eyes and causes his car to burst into flames once he is inside. Oliver tries to rescue the man, but is unable to open the car doors. The drunken man burns to death inside his car.Ben appears at the Farrell home the next day and flirts openly with Susan while her husband is at work. She responds in kind, and their ensuing sexual encounter concludes with Susan using a garden claw to kill and mutilate Ben. The following morning, Cora arrives at the house, asking for Susan\u0027s signature on some estate papers. The demon overtakes Susan and uses powers of telekinesis to levitate Cora off the the floor and makes her torso split open, killing her as well.Oliver is unaware of his wife\u0027s alter ego until later that night, when he awakens to find Susan asleep in a rocking chair, bearing the demon\u0027s face. He telephones Simon, who maintains his skepticism and offers an appointment for the next day. Susan returns to normal, but Oliver is unable to sleep.In the morning, he asks Elsie (LaWanda Page), the maid, to look after Susan until he returns in the early afternoon. However, the green fog and pulsating light that surround Susan only encourage the maid to pack her suitcase and leave, never to return.Although Susan tells her husband that nothing is wrong, she keeps her appointment with Simon. The psychiatrist places her under hypnosis and records the session, during which the demon reveals itself. Afterward, Simon plays the tape for his colleague, Dr. Roni Logan (Sheri Mann), a specialist in the paranormal, who convinces him of Susan\u0027s demonic possession.Meanwhile, Susan invites a delivery boy (Chu Chu Malave) into her home with the promise of sex, but she transforms into the demon and uses powers to telekinesis to split his skull, killing him too.The next day, Simon informs Oliver of Susan\u0027s condition and instructs him to avoid close contact with her until the crown of thorns has been retrieved. That afternoon, Susan goes to a local shopping mall where she steals a painting from an art gallery. When the salesman pursues her, she uses her demon powers to levitate him high above the floor, then allows him to drop onto a conical metal sculpture on the ground level.Upon his return home, Oliver expresses dislike for the painting, which features a centaur and bare-breasted women. The tension between the couple continues through dinner, but Oliver later apologizes to Susan while she is taking a bubble bath, and she climbs from the tub to embrace him. A thunderstorm rages outside as Simon removes the crown of thorns from the mausoleum gate, and Susan tightens her embrace until it crushes Oliver\u0027s body (her bare breasts turn into two individual demon heads which their mouths filled with sharp teeth disembowel Oliver).Simon arrives at the house a little later to find Oliver dead in the bathtub and Susan playing with dolls in the attic. As Susan reminisces about her childhood, Simon places the crown of thorns on her head, removing the demon from her body and returning it to the cemetery. Simon and Susan arrive at the mausoleum, where they find the creature sprawled over the tomb. At the urging of Simon, Susan places the crown on the demon\u0027s head, and the tomb opens, trapping the monster inside as the sun rises outside.Susan emerges from the experience in a state of bewilderment, and Simon promises to explain everything over time (refusing to tell her about Oliver\u0027s fate). Before leaving the cemetery, Simon tells the caretaker (the same robed being from earlier), \"You\u0027ve known this secret and lived with it, like your father before you and his father before him,\" reminding him that no one is to enter the mausoleum.

Nick Hommel (James Dobson) and Carl Turner (Jack Kelly) join the others around a basket. They take a few pictures then talk to the snake charmer, Daru (Leonard Strong). For $2 he agrees to hold the snake. Paul asks about a cult that believes snakes can be transformed into humans. Daru is visibly surprised. One man says he\u0027d give anything to see it. This piques Daru\u0027s interest. He tells the men that he is a Lamian and for $100 he will show them, \"she who is a snake, and yet a woman.\" They make arrangements to see the ceremony that evening, but Daru warns them that pictures are forbidden.The men meet and get reasonably drunk. Daru shows up as promised. He gets them past the guards. They are dressed like locals. He warns them that if they are discovered they will be killed. They enter a large curtain lined room. On a raised platform there is a stone shrine and a large basket. They discover Nick is missing from the group. A dancer performs a ritual and out of the basket a woman emerges and dances. The ritual includes the snake woman biting and killing a man. Against orders, Nick takes a picture; his flash angers the assembled men. Nick is attacked. The other five men start a fight as Nick grabs the basket and makes his way to the exit. One of the Lamians (Edward Platt) tells them, \"The Cobra Goddess will avenge herself. One by one you will die!\" Just prior to exiting, Tom sets the curtains on fire to create a diversion. Daru is killed by the mob. The five men escape in the jeep, but Nick is still missing. They spot a woman walking away from the basket and discover Nick on the ground. Tom chases the woman but she escapes. Nick is still alive, but they discover a snake bite on his neck. Tom performs a hasty snake bite remedy to remove most of the venom. Carl, Rico and Pete carry Nick to the jeep. Tom tells Paul, \"Lets get out of here.\" They return to the base. They are supposed to ship out the next morning.Nick Hommel is in a hospital bed surrounded by his buddies. He tells the men he wanted the basket as a souvenir. The nurse (Mary Alan Hokanson) arrives to take Nick\u0027s temperature and asks the men to leave. She adjusts the window down a bit to keep out the rain. Outside a cobra works its way towards the building. It enters Nicks room. He sees it and screams, but a clap of thunder muffles his cry. The next morning Major Martin Fielding (Olan Soule) tells Paul Able that Nick died early in the morning. He succumbed to neurotoxic venom that paralyzed his heart. After Paul leaves to catch his transport home, Fielding explains to Capt. Steve Williams (Alan Reynolds) that he is puzzled also. Most of the venom was removed from Nick before he was admitted to the hospital, but by morning he had been re-infected. The body was loaded with cobra venom.The men fly home on a DC-3. They discuss their post-military lives. Rico will be running his Dad\u0027s bowling alley. All the men are discharged from the military and begin their civilian lives.On the streets of New York City, Paul Able and his fiancé, Julia Thompson (Kathleen Hughes) have come to see Rico Nardi at the bowling alley. She tells Tom she is going to marry Paul. She still needs to tell Rico. Tom is initially angry and disappointed and tells Rico the good news before Julia has the chance. She had been dating Tom and Rico before she got serious with Paul. Tom and Paul are roommates. In his apartment, Tom\u0027s dog is restless and wakes him in the middle of the night. He goes to the kitchen and hears a woman scream. He exits his apartment and forces the door to the apartment across from his. He finds Lisa Moya (Faith Domergue) against the wall sobbing. She tells Tom there was a man in her apartment. Tom checks the apartment, finds no one, then picks up the phone to call the police. Lisa tells him no, no police. She tells him to stay a while. She explains that she just moved into the apartment today and has only been in the city a week. He tells her he is a commercial artist--advertising. They agree to a date the next day to see the city.They meet the next day and visit some of the sights in the city: Staten Island Ferry, the Statue of Liberty, Wall Street and the Fulton Fish Market. They stop at a hot dog stand for lunch. That evening they return home, but she rebuffs his advance to kiss her. Tom introduces Lisa to his roommate, Paul and the dog freaks out. She sees a picture and picks it up. It is a picture of the six men taken when they were deployed in Asia. Tom explains who and where everyone is now. They agree to meet on Sunday at Carl\u0027s apartment; he is having a party. No sooner is she back in her apartment, but she gets her coat and leaves. She walks along the street and encounters a cat that screeches at her and runs away. It is apparent she just doesn\u0027t have a way with animals, any animals. At Rico\u0027s bowling alley, Carl and Pete, who are also roommates, pay their tab and leave. Rico is closing up the place when Lisa arrives outside. A bowling pin falls over and Rico investigates. He carries a case of beer out to his car for Carl\u0027s party. Mrs. Webber (Helen Wallace) asks for a donation for a charitable organization. Rico heads back inside to close up. He grabs his coat, locks the door and gets in his car. He drives off, whistling, sees the cobra in the rear view mirror, panics and runs his car off the street. He rolls the car and is killed instantly. Lisa walks back to her apartment.The remaining four men and Lisa attend Rico\u0027s funeral. Carl decides to have the party on Sunday. As Tom and Paul walk with Lisa back home a horse freaks out at her presence. She tells Paul she\u0027s always been afraid of horses. Paul is beginning to believe Lisa is not who she claims to be and is increasingly worried about her influence over Tom. He is starting to believe the curse is real and they are all destined to be killed.At Carl\u0027s party, Lisa is dancing with the host. Tom is jealous. At one point he slugs Carl and tells Lisa to get her coat, they\u0027re leaving. Paul tells Carl, \"I\u0027m sure she\u0027s no good for him.\" Paul meets Julia after she returns from her show out of town. She is back in New York rehearsing--she is an actress. Paul asks her to talk to Tom. He admits he\u0027s afraid of Lisa. It has to do with Rico\u0027s death. He doesn\u0027t think it was an accident. He tells her about the cult story. He thinks Lisa is involved.Tom returns from his date with Lisa at Carl\u0027s party. They talk and he tells her he loves her. She leaves and returns to her own apartment. He checks on the dog. Tom notices that Lisa forgot her gloves. He tries to return them. He knocks on her door, but she doesn\u0027t answer. He uses the key he borrowed earlier to get some ice and lets himself in. He discovers she isn\u0027t there. He sits and has a smoke and waits for her. The party is over at Carl\u0027s and everyone is leaving. Pete leaves with Marian Sheehan (Myrna Hansen) his date for the evening. Carl set them up. He is going to take her home, then return. They leave the building. Lisa sees them and hides, and then enters the building. She knocks on Carl\u0027s door; he invites her in. She tells him she wanted to apologize for spoiling the party. She tells him she really came back to see him. Carl goes into the kitchen to mix some drinks, but when he returns to the living room Lisa is gone. He goes over to a chair and sees the cobra. He strikes it with a plaster vase, but it bites him and he falls over a railing and down to his death on the sidewalk. Pete returns and finds a crowd gathered around Carl\u0027s body. Lisa joins the crowd and Pete warns her not to look. The police arrive and ask if anyone knows the deceased. Pete volunteers that he and Carl were roommates. The police ask Pete to come with them. Lisa returns home to find Tom sleeping on her couch. They talk about their relationship. She voices her concern about hurting him.The next morning Paul makes breakfast for him and Tom. They talk. He tells Tom he and Julia are going down for their marriage license. The telephone rings; its the police asking about Carl. They want to see both Paul and Tom immediately. Paul tells them they will be right down.Pete Norton\u0027s blood is checked for type. The Police Inspector (Walter Coy) tells the lab tech when Paul and Tom arrive he wants their blood typed as well. The Inspector interrogates Pete then releases him. Julia is at Tom and Paul\u0027s apartment reading up on cults. Lisa stops by for her usual breakfast coffee and inquires about Tom and Paul. Julia tells her they are at the police station. Julia tells Lisa about Paul\u0027s recent fascination with cults and cobras. She tells Lisa that there are people that believe they can turn into snakes. Lisa responds strangely. Julia adds that Paul fells that is why Rico, Carl and Nick are dead. Julia hastily departs after paying the dry cleaner for some shirts delivered.The Police Inspector interrogates Tom and Paul. They are released to go when the blood tests reveal they were not involved directly in Carl\u0027s death. Before he leaves, Paul volunteers the cult story. Paul accuses Lisa of being an agent for the curse. Tom storms off. Back at Lisa\u0027s apartment, Pete Norton confronts Lisa over a scratch on her arm. He believes it came from the vase Carl threw at the cobra. He accuses her of being a Lamian. She goes to her bedroom under the pretense of getting her passport to prove she was elsewhere when Nick was killed in India. There we see her, in shadow, transform into a cobra. She leaves her apartment and collects Tom at his. They sit and have coffee. They are formally dressed for Julia\u0027s Broadway show that evening.The Police Inspector tells Paul that, working on his story, they checked the autopsy reports on Carl Turner and Rico Nardi. It was death by snake venom, a large one. He agrees to pick up Lisa for questioning. The police force the door on Lisa\u0027s apartment and find Pete\u0027s body. He has two puncture wounds on his neck. Paul calls the Theatre to talk to Tom. Lisa goes up to Julia\u0027s dressing room looking for Paul. Paul tells Tom they found Pete dead in Lisa\u0027s apartment. The police leave Lisa\u0027s apartment and drive over to the Theatre. Julia returns to her dressing room while Tom notices Lisa is missing from her box seat. A door slowly opens and Julia notices the cobra on the floor. She screams. Tom enters her dressing room and is confronted by the snake. He throws a costume over it. He breaks a window with a chair and using a coat rack pushes the cobra out the window. When the police arrive we see the cobra transform back into Lisa, dead on the street below the window. A crowd gathers. We close with an anguished Tom walking away down the street.

Suddenly a hand is seen at the door, trying to get in. Sensing danger, he quickly flees and goes down cobblestone streets and steps until he reaches a stable. Quickly he saddles a horse and secures the straps. He attempts to untie the rope, but suddenly the horse is startled and begins furiously bucking up and down, stomping him to death. Next we see a close-up of his face: half-mutilated with one eye hanging out. (Title shows.)Albert Kovac (Walter Brandi) is driving an open-air touring car down a country lane. He passes an old woman (in a deleted scene, he inquires of the woman where the castle is and she crosses herself). He turns into a drive leading up to a castle (Villa Hauff), parking in front. Removing his cap and putting it in the back seat, he retrieves his briefcase and goes to ring the bell at the front door.The bell will not ring, however. He knocks on the door and pushes it open. Entering, he calls out if anyone is home. He walks down the entrance hall, passing various statues and suits of armor. Hearing a noise behind him, he turns to see the maid, Louise (Tilde Till) who has come out from one of the rooms. He explains that no one answered when he came in. He asks her to introduce him and she opens a door and bids him enter. Inside, Corinne Hauff (Mirella Maravidi) is wiping off a standing suit of armor. He introduces himself and asks if she is the daughter of Dr. Jeronimus Hauff, which she confirms. She tells Louise to take the gentleman\u0027s coat. Louise is staring at Kovac as if she hasn\u0027t seen a man in years. Finally her attention is gained by Corinne and the coat is taken.He explains that he is an attorney who received a letter requesting he come and take care of Dr. Hauffs will. She leads him down a hall toward another room. On the way he notices a display case containing six mummified hands. He follows her into a bedroom where he is asked to show the letter. Giving it to Corinne, she hands it to Cleo Hauff (Barbara Steele) who is seated with cold cream on her face. Immediately she begins wiping her face and looks at the letter. Minutes later she emerges with her face clean and ready to talk.She asks if he is the attorney addressed on the envelope, Joseph Morgan (Riccardo Garrone). He explains that Morgan was absent when the letter arrived so he came at once since it seemed urgent. (In a deleted scene at the beginning of the film Morgan is seen leaving and Kovac reads the mail, finding the letter.) She reads from the letter and remarks how it looks like his writing and seal. He asks if her husband had told her about the letter. She responds that her husband has been dead for a year. Meanwhile there is a flash of lightning and the front door is blown open. Louise closes and bolts the door.Invited to stay the night, they are next seen at dinner, discussing the letter. Cleo speculates that it must be a fraud while Corinne insists that it is her fathers handwriting and seal. Cleo tells Kovac that the seal was buried with her husband and that she is his second wife. Kovac asks to smoke and is told of course . Louise enters and asks if she should serve the coffee. After this is done, she asks if she may be excused for the evening. Cleo excuses her and she politely curtsies to each of the ladies and leaves. Cleo remarks how not even a storm can keep Louise in the castle.Kovac tells them that the police will have to be informed of the death. Cleo tells him that it was Dr. Hauffs wish to be interred in the ground for one year before being laid to final rest. She says the villagers want nothing to do with this place, citing superstitions. Corinne corrects her, telling Kovac that her father was a spiritualist who tried to contact supernatural forces. She points to a bust of a woman which has three scratches on the cheek. He notes that they are real. Corinne says she believes it was done by something supernatural. Cleo tells her not to speak anymore of this. Cleo suggests that Kovac might want to telephone his office. Looking at his pocket watch, he remarks that Morgan is usually in his office at this time.Kovac picks up the phone, giving the operator Morgans number. All at once there is lightning and thunder and strange noises on the line. Outside we see part of the telephone line fall beside the grave of Jeronimus Hauff. Kovac asks the operator what is wrong with the line but she replies there is nothing wrong with it. At this point a strange man enters, carrying a candelabra. It is Kurt, the servant (Luciano Pigozzi) who stares at Kovac. We hear Kovac talking to himself, wondering about the strange man and how much he knows. Kurt closes the shutters and leaves the room just as Corinne enters. She tells Kovac that it is Kurt the gardener and that he has never left since the death of Dr. Hauff. Looking at a painting of the castle and surrounding area, she tells Kovac that hundreds of men died here, since it was once used as a hospital. As for the severed arms, Corinne tells him they are the mummified remains of those who spread the Black Plague. He makes a joke and she tells him not to, saying her father discovered many things about the house. She shows him to her fathers room, telling him to stay there for the night.Inside, he lights a cigarette, thinking of how strange the whole situation is. He finds another adjoining room and takes a candelabra in to see it. It is Dr. Hauffs office, where he finds an old Edison recording cylinder. Cranking it, he turns the needle to play the recording. It is the voice of Hauff, who talks about several people who were spreading the plague. When caught, their hands were severed before they were hanged. The remains were buried on the property. As he describes the sound of the wagon carrying corpses to a mass grave, the sounds of creaking wheels are heard outside. We see covered graves and wagon wheel tracks in the dirt.Corinne begins to undress in her room, when suddenly she turns to look and screams, covering herself. Kovac, hearing the scream, starts to her room. She comes out, claiming that she saw her father in her room. Cleo suggests that Corinne is too tired and on edge and has imagined it all. Entering her room, she reacts to the sight of a bronze bust of her father. Cleo tells her that it is only a statue. As they leave, Cleo tells Kovac that Corinne learned all of these things from her father. She says she will show Kovac where he died. They come to a long stairway going down below. She tells him that Dr. Hauff fell there and died. At the bottom of the stairs we see the face of Kurt, who looks up at them. Meanwhile, the recorded voice of Hauff, playing the last groove of the recording over and over, intones: I summoned them from their graves, and now I am among them.Outside, Kovac finds that an owl has gotten into his engine and caused damage (in a deleted scene we see the owl when Louise is admiring the car). When he asks Kurt how to get into town, he gets no reply. At this point Dr. Nemek (Alfredo Rizzo) walks up, telling Kovac that he will get nothing from Kurt. When Kovac shows the engine to Nemek, he says no one knows how to work on engines. Nemek explains that he is the new doctor for the area. Kovac asks for a ride into town and Nemek agrees. As they walk by the castle, he asks about what he sees. Nemek tells him that these are the unconsecrated graves of the plague spreaders from the fifteenth century. As they walk toward the horse and buggy, Corinne approaches and asks for a ride into town. They all get in and start out.Meanwhile, Cleo in their absence goes through the briefcase, removing documents to read. She asks the operator if the phone line to town has been repaired and is told it has. Then she hangs up.They arrive at a building where Nemek tells them he has to stop for a few minutes. He suggests they take a walk down by the lake. They do.Corinne talks about her father being misunderstood by everyone and that he had supernatural powers. She apologizes about her outburst last night, saying that he was in the room. They walk along the shoreline, past a number of small boats. She tells Kovac that her father used to bring her there often. She points out two sticks in the ground, a large one and a smaller one. Explaining that this is a sundial her father devised, she tells him that when the shadow of one touches the other, the time is right for fishing in the reeds. Turning back the other way, she suddenly screams my father! and runs into the reeds, falling down. Kovac chases her and she tells him that she saw her father in a boat in the reeds. We see it with an oar attached. She claims that the water dripping from the oar means it was just used. He tells her there is no one there. Frightened, she seeks comfort in his arms. Just then Nemek calls them to go back.They are seen in the home of Oskar Stinner (Ennio Balbo), a paralytic in a wheelchair. Corinne is seen dressing behind a sheet in silhouette. Her clothes which were hung by the fire are now dry and handed to her by Dr. Nemek. Kovac smokes and Corinne is shown getting dressed (shown behind the sheet). Nemek tells Kovac that Stinner has a fine wine for them. He gets the bottle and some glasses, explaining that he can smell a good wine for miles. Stinner refuses to drink, but wine is offered to Corinne and Kovac, who suggests they talk about the letter. He shows it to Nemek, who remarks how it looks authentic. Stinner asks to see it, telling them he has an old letter to compare it to. Pulling one out of his desk, he looks at both seals, saying they are the same. Kovac says the police must be informed. Stinner tells Corinne to get out of town before its too late. Nemek says they should get back home and tells Stinner not to worry and that he will come see him tomorrow. Kovac thanks Stinner and exits. Corinne hesitates by the door, telling Stinner she will see him again soon. As they leave, Stinner says to himself I will never see her again. I just know it. The day of revenge is at hand.Arriving at the local apothecary, Nemek tells them he knows the pharmacist who also serves as the mayor. Inside, he calls the mans name but gets no answer. They look around and Nemek continues to call out. As he looks behind the counter, he is horrified to see the man dead, with a bottle of acid dripping on his horribly disfigured face. They immediately get Corinne into the carriage to leave, telling her they will join her later. She drives off to return home.Inside the hall of records, Nemek fills out a death certificate and signs it, stating that cause of death was heart failure. Kovac asks whether the police should be involved but is told that a heart attack is not a violent death. Nemek asks the clerk for two forms, which he brings immediately. Looking at the forms, he asks the clerk why they are already filled out. He is told that the corpse collectors came by the village last night and that everyone knows when that happens that someone will die. Kovac says how could you know it would be the mayor? The clerk tells him it was one of the five men present at the death of Hauff and that they all are doomed to die.Cleo is seen in a bubble bath. Corinne enters and is asked to scrub Cleos back. Taking Corinnes hand, Cleo remarks how she is trembling. Corinne replies that she saw the mayors body, horribly eaten away by acid in the pharmacy. Cleo seems shocked and steps out of the bath. When asked if the mayor was her friend, Cleo says no, but he was one of the men who would come around to see Jeronimus. She states that all his friends were low-class individuals, not like what she was accustomed to. Corinne implies that her step-mother had been a performer. Cleo answers that she had to give up her career to marry Dr. Hauff, who became a crazy country doctor. She tells Corinne that it was not what she expected. Her friends formerly envied her. Rising to leave, Corinne tells her flat out that she is the same lousy actress she always was.Back at the hall of records, the clerk looks up and begins to read the death notice of Dr. Hauff, which was signed by the five men present at the time. He notes that three of them are dead and the remaining two have not long to live. Kovac takes the page with their names to study it. As Kovac calls out each of the three names, the clerk reads the fate of each one from the record. Asking who the fourth man is, the clerk is told Oskar Stinner. It is said that the name of the fifth man is unknown because the handwriting is illegible. Kovac expresses doubt that the friends of Hauff would want to kill him, but the clerk suggests they hated him because he dabbled in the occult.Back in his room, Kovac wonders about the fifth man. He plays the recording, hearing a girls voice singing remember pure water, pure water will save you. Looking out the window, he sees a young girl sitting at the fountain below. He goes down to the fountain but finds only the flowers the girl was holding, now discarded in the water.Stinner is seated at his desk when he hears the sounds of the corpse collectors wagon outside and declares that the end has come. After a torturous moment of worry, he rolls his wheelchair to the wall and removes a sword, which he places point-out from a chest of drawers. Backing up, he rushes upon the sword and kills himself. At this point the window opens from outside and we see Stinner dead from behind. One of the mummified hands is seen upon his shoulder, implying that it had come to kill him but was too late. The hand pulls Stinners wheelchair back off of the sword, which drips. We see from a front angle that Stinners intestines are hanging out. (In a deleted scene there is an alternative death scene where he dies by hanging himself instead of by sword.)Next day a policeman is shown investigating at Stinners place. Nemek tells him he will come by the station later to file a report. He tells the men to take the body away. Kovac asks Nemek if he still believes this is coincidence, to which Nemek replies he isn\u0027t sure anymore. When Kovac reminds him that they both heard the clerk predicting the death but they did nothing, Nemek replies that there is nothing they could have done to have prevented Stinner from taking his own life. Kovac suggests that maybe Hauff is still alive and that his body has not been seen, except by the witnesses. Finding a partially-burned note on the desk, Kovac shows in to Nemek, telling him that Stinner was writing it to warn the final victim, who was summoned. He tells him that tomorrow Hauffs body will be dug up to be re-interred. They are hoping to see the body at that time, which would prove whether Hauff is really dead.The next day at the cemetery a small gathering stands around the temporary grave. As the slab is removed from the grave, those present see that it is empty. Some gasping is heard from the ladies. Kovac thinks to himself so that means the fifth witness is in danger. He is directed to a phone to call his boss but is told he has left for the Villa Hauff. Explaining to Nemek, Kovac says the fifth witness is Morgan, since he was the one summoned by the original letter.Morgan enters the castle and looks around, seeing no one. He goes into another room and hears Dr. Hauff greeting him from a chair across the room (his face is not visible, but as Morgan nervously approaches, he notices a ring on Hauffs hand with a large jeweled J).Kovac and Nemek arrive and begin to search for Morgan. His hat is seen on a hallway table. Morgan comes out from the front room in a state of shock. The men sit him down. He tells them that he saw Jeronimus. When Kovac goes to search the room, he finds only a cat in the chair. He is given a sedative by Dr. Nemek. Kovac demands to know why he has come. Nemek suggests that this discussion take place later. Kovac leaves with an apology, giving Morgan the letter.Next we see Louise preparing to leave, questioned by Corinne about what she saw. She says she saw nothing, only feeling more coldness in the house than during a normal winter. Locking herself in the kitchen in fear, she tells Corinne she heard the voice of Jeronimus speaking. Asking what he said, she says to ask Kurt. At this point she leaves, saying that she can no longer remain in this house.Corinne apologizes to Kovac, telling him it is her fault for asking him to remain. She confesses her need for him and they kiss. At this point they are interrupted by Nemek, who asks for cognac. She goes to fetch it while the men sit down. Kovac tells Nemek that Morgan is highly believable, because he doesn\u0027t believe in ghosts. They both agree that Kurt needs to be found so that what he knows can be determined. Corinne enters with a tray and two glasses, carrying some kind of dispenser which she sets on the table. Nemek seems pleased and Corinne adjusts something on the dispenser.Louise is seen walking through the woods. Bird sounds are heard, which gradually give way to the sound of the corpse collectors cart. Louise looks around but sees nothing. She hurries away.Morgan is awakened by the door opening. Cleo comes in and he stands to greet her. From their conversation we learn that they had agreed to separate for one year after the death of Jeronimus, but Cleo tells him they cant just resume their affair now. Confessing his love, Morgan begins kissing her shoulder. Next they are seen in bed, kissing.Meanwhile Corinne goes to the attic with Kovac to look around. They find a doll, which she explains was hers. It contains a music box which plays. Kovac remarks that he knows that tune. Corinne tells him it is an old song which she then sings. He remembers it from the recording he heard before and wonders what is the meaning of pure water will save you?Cleo listens as Morgan reads the letter sent to his office, which was signed by Jeronimus. She asks if he believes Hauff wrote it. He tells her he knows who is behind all this. Checking his gun, he informs her that there was one more witness there that night: Kurt.Corinne and Kovac go down below into a crypt-like room where she calls out for Kurt. Hearing no answer, they leave. One wall opens and Kurt enters, carrying the body of Hauff, which he lays on the slab. He says to the corpse that the night of revenge has begun. He removes the ring (which contains the J used to make the seal) from Hauffs finger and places it in a torch, which causes it to flare up. Soon the hour of death will come, he says, which will free the spirits of the plague spreaders, who will begin killing the innocent and guilty alike. He confesses his loyalty to Hauff but asks forgiveness for having to break his vow of silence, since Corinne will have to be warned.Nemek asks whether they found Kurt, to which Kovac says no, telling him that they searched the entire house. At this moment Corinne screams as she sees Kurt coming in, his face all covered with oozing sores, signs of the plague. Nemek tells them not to touch him. Kurt says the night of his revenge has begun, and they are here. Pointing to a full-length mirror, he says that one year ago he saw it all happen here. In a flash-back sequence, we see the five men (not including Kurt) and Cleo all facing Jeronimus, who reveals that they had all signed a petition to run him out of town. He refuses to leave, telling them he knows too much about their sins and will alert the public. He addresses each one, telling what he knows. Finally he faces Cleo and Morgan, telling them he had known about their clandestine affair for some time. Morgan approaches him with a candlestick to strike him from behind. Encouraged by each face, he hesitates until Cleo cries out kill him, Joseph! Hauff is struck from behind and falls, cursing them all and telling them that they wont escape his anger.Coming out of the flashback, Cleo tells him to go back to the dead and throws a candlestick at the mirror, breaking it. Hauffs voice is heard summoning the dead spirits of the plague spreaders to avenge him. The grave covers are slid over and we see at least one hand emerging. Cleo cries no and begins to run. She goes from door to door but cannot escape. She opens a double outer door and screams. As she turns back inside, we see her face with signs of the plague. She staggers around the room, getting a glimpse of her face reflected in the tray. Finally she falls upon the harp and breathes her last. Morgan shouts that he will not die. Pulling out his gun, he tells Hauff that he is not afraid but begins acting like he is being stalked. Firing several shots, he too receives signs of the plague and collapses. As Kovac looks at him, he notices on a grandfather clock the painting of the young girl at the fountain, again wondering about the pure water that will save them. (In a deleted scene Kovac is told about the painting of this legendary girl who would save the village with purified water.) Thunder and lightning are heard. All at once he announces that water is the answer. He tells Nemek to take Corinne outside. She protests that she wants to remain with Kovac.Opening up a door, Kovac sees Louise, now covered with the plague. She dies in his arms. He goes outside to join the others. The sounds of the corpse collectors cart are heard and the open graves are viewed. Kovac tells them that it is the water that has kept the spirits away, and now that all the water is drying up, they can only hope for rain. Nemek takes Corinne aside and a mummified hand is seen in the bushes. When we see Nemek again, he has the plague, telling her not to touch him. Kovac stumbles around, backing away from an unseen spirit. Only the shadow is visible approaching him. As he is backed into a corner and sinks down, suddenly the menacing sounds stop and raindrops appear. Corinne calls out that it is raining and the two of them embrace. Saved from the avengers, they are seen walking off together as the rain comes down.","Weighted Degree":"2.0","numvotes":"1014","productioncompany":"G.I.A.

While wealthy, charming, generally intelligent and very handsome, he is naive and easily manipulated. These faults lead to his spiral into sin and, ultimately, misery.While posing for a painting by his artist friend Basil Hallward (Lowell Gilmore), Dorian meets Basil\u0027s friend Lord Henry Wotton (George Sanders). Wotton is enchantingly cynical and witty, and tells Dorian that the only life worth living is one dedicated entirely to pleasure. After Wotton convinces Dorian that youth and beauty will bring him everything he desires, Dorian openly wishes that his portrait could age in his place, and that he could keep his youthful good looks forever. He makes this statement in the presence of a certain Egyptian statue, which supposedly has the power to grant wishes. When the portrait of Dorian is complete, Lord Henry hails it as a masterpiece and is surprised when Basil announces he will never exhibit it because he feels he put \"too much of himself\" into it. Basil is also concerned about Lord Henry\u0027s influence on the impressionable Dorian, who Basil considers a dear friend and an artistic muse. Basil gives the painting to Dorian, who proudly hangs it in his opulent home.One fateful night, Dorian visits a lower-class tavern, The Two Turtles, where he is given a prime seat for the night\u0027s entertainment. He is instantly charmed by the tavern owners\u0027 daughter, Sibyl Vane (Angela Lansbury), who performs a sweet singing routine during the lineup. Dorian is invited backstage after the show to meet Sibyl, and plays the piano for her in the empty tavern. Sibyl is flattered by the attention of such a handsome gentleman, and her mother (Lydia Bilbrook) encourages the relationship because of Dorian\u0027s wealth, but Sibyl\u0027s brother James (Richard Fraser) is suspicious. James tells his enamored sister in private that if this young man, whom Sibyl nicknamed \"Sir Tristan\" after a virtuous knight in Arthurian mythology, ever harms her, he will kill him. James is then deployed to Australia on a sailing mission.Dorian excitedly tells Basil and Lord Henry that he is engaged to the beautiful Sibyl Vane, and invites them to come with him to the tavern to hear her sing. Despite having heard Lord Henry\u0027s disdainful views on marriage, Dorian is so genuinely happy that Lord Henry\u0027s words no longer influence him. Basil sees this as a positive development, and after seeing Sibyl perform and making her acquaintance, encourages the engagement for the sake of Dorian\u0027s moral purity. Lord Henry, on the other hand, cannot resist exploiting his innate ability to influence his friends, and suggests that Dorian test Sibyl\u0027s worth with an \"experiment.\" Dorian invites Sibyl to his house that night and, when she prepares to go home, asks her to stay. Torn between love and honor, Sibyl nearly leaves, but cannot resist Dorian\u0027s charm. This meant that she had failed Lord Henry\u0027s test, and Dorian sends her an incredibly hurtful letter, accusing her of \"killing his love,\" and that she can have no part in his life henceforth. He sends her a sum of money for compensation, but Sibyl is emotionally destroyed.When Dorian returns home after abandoning Sibyl, he notices a slight change in the portrait Basil had painted of him. The mouth looks somehow crueler, and a cold unkindness is present in the face that had not been there before. When he wakes the next morning, the change is still visible. He feels immense guilt over how badly he had treated Sibyl, and hastily composes an apology letter in an attempt to redeem himself. Before he can deliver it, Lord Henry arrives with the news that Sibyl Vane had killed herself the night before. Dorian is initially devastated, but Lord Henry convinces him to not blame himself for the tragedy and invites him to the opera. Abandoning his grief, Dorian falls deeper into Lord Henry\u0027s teachings of \"new hedonism\", and goes to the opera with him that very night. Basil is surprised and worried when he witnesses Dorian\u0027s uncaring behavior in regard to Sibyl\u0027s death, and Dorian plans to dedicate his life solely to his own pleasure. Because the change in the portrait still disturbed him, Dorian has it covered with a screen and locked in his old school room at the top of the house, to which he keeps the only key.Eighteen years later, Dorian is nearing his fortieth birthday, but has not visibly changed since age twenty-two. His friends and neighbors are awestruck at his youthful appearance, but unsavory rumors constantly circulate about his strange behavior and acquaintances. Having taken Lord Henry\u0027s ideas to heart, Dorian\u0027s life consists largely of scandals with women, opium dens, and influencing other wealthy young men to adopt his hedonistic way of living. Over time, many of his friends lost their good standing in society, and women were shamed to be in his company. Dorian meets Basil again, who is preparing to catch a train to Paris, and invites him to his house. Basil expresses his concern about Dorian\u0027s behavior, and admits that in order to truly know what kind of man Dorian is, he would have to see his soul itself. Dorian grimly leads Basil up to the old school room to look upon his handiwork for the first time in eighteen years. Dorian removes the coverings from the hidden portrait, and Basil is horrified to see that the man in the painting has warped into a hideous, demon-like creature to reflect Dorian\u0027s multitude of sins. Basil begs Dorian to repent and change his ways, but Dorian feels a surge of anger toward Basil, blaming him for his miserable life because the painting was his own work. Dorian stabs Basil to death and locks his body in the school room with the horrible painting, in which blood has appeared on the hands of the twisted painted Dorian.The next morning, Dorian summons a former friend, Allen Campbell (Douglas Walton), whose reputation had since been ruined by his associations with Dorian. Campbell is a scientist specializing in anatomy and chemistry, and Dorian blackmails the highly reluctant man into disposing of Basil\u0027s body. The nature of the blackmailing subject is not revealed, but Campbell agrees to disintegrate Basil\u0027s body, and departs afterward looking shaken and disturbed.Basil\u0027s disappearance is talked about in London society for some time, but Dorian is never suspected. Among the few who have remained his loyal friends are Lord Henry and Gladys (Donna Reed), Basil\u0027s niece, who was a little girl when the portrait was painted. Dorian enters a romance with Gladys, though he is apprehensive about the effect he appears to have on the lives of those he becomes close to. He visits a seedy inn one evening and finds a former friend, Adrian Singleton (Morton Lowry), a wealthy young man who had been ruined by following Dorian\u0027s influence. Adrian is now a disheveled opium addict, but he knows of Dorian\u0027s sordid past and mockingly addresses him as \"Sir Tristan\" as Dorian departs the inn. The nickname is overheard by James Vane, Sibyl\u0027s brother, who happened to be at the inn and had spent eighteen years being hell-bent on avenging his sister. Though he did not know her cruel suitor\u0027s name and had never seen his face, the name \"Sir Tristan\" is enough to motivate him to follow Dorian outside and threaten him. Dorian calmly denies ever knowing a Sibyl Vane, and asserts that he is too young to have had anything to do with a death that occurred eighteen years before. James Vane admits that this man looks too young to be the suspect, and releases him. Adrian Singleton, with both amusement and resentment, explains to James that Dorian Gray was the man he sought, and that he had not looked a day older than twenty-two for the past eighteen years. Enraged, James Vane begins to track down Dorian Gray.A few days later, Dorian attends a hunting party with several society friends. The sport is interrupted when a man, assumed to be a beater, is shot to death by accident after hiding in the bushes unseen. It is revealed to Dorian later that the dead man was not a beater, but James Vane, having followed Dorian in revenge and lost his own life in the process. Dorian feels even more guilty and cursed, but wishes to make one final stab at having a good and worthwhile life. He soon proposes marriage to Gladys, who happily accepts, much to the displeasure of her friend David Stone (Peter Lawford), who is one of the many who are suspicious of Dorian.Despite his happiness about his upcoming marriage to Gladys, Dorian is weighted down by the deaths of Sibyl, Basil, and James, as well as the ruin of Adrian Singleton and others like him. The last straw is the news that Allen Campbell, whom Dorian ruined and then blackmailed into disposing of Basil\u0027s body, had killed himself in misery. Dorian realizes that the one noble thing he can possibly do is to spare Gladys from the certain misfortune he will bring her.At long last, Dorian ventures up to the school room to face the painting that is the embodiment of his corrupted soul. Using the same knife with which he had murdered Basil Hallward, he stabs his painted figure through the heart. Dorian himself feels the effect of the knife, and collapses, praying for his salvation. Roused by his screams, his houseguests, including Gladys, David, and Lord Henry, rush upstairs and find Dorian Gray\u0027s dead body on the school room floor, now in the form of the hideous creature from the painting. The painting itself, with the knife still protruding from it, has reverted to its original image of the handsome, innocent youth than Dorian once was. Lord Henry, stricken, sees the horrible results of his own influence and gazes at Dorian\u0027s corpse in shocked remorse.","Weighted Degree":"3.0","numvotes":"12975","productioncompany":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM)","countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"7.5","originaltitle":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","size":"1","genres":"Drama,Fantasy,Horror","storyline":"In 1886, in Victorian London, the corrupt Lord Henry Wotton (George Sanders) meets the pure Dorian Gray (Hurd Hatfield) posing for talented painter Basil Hallward (Lowell Gilmore).

To pass the time in his cell, Betty had given Timmy an old, thick book called \"Tales From the Darkside\". When she reveals her plans for him, Timmy begins to stall her by reading her some of the stories.The first story is called \"Lot 249\". At a prestigious university, a nerdy student, Bellingham, is bullied by two rich students, Susan and Lee, who are quite contemptuous of him because he\u0027s a work-study student. Susan\u0027s brother, Andy, helps Bellingham one night with a new specimen that has arrived in the archeology department: an ancient mummy. Speaking about how the ancient Egyptians would draw the corpse\u0027s brains out through it\u0027s nose with a hook and stuff vegetables into it\u0027s abdomen, Bellingham finds the incision in the mummy\u0027s abdomen where his preparers had stuffed him with herbs and onions.

While he rides away in a cab, he chuckles to himself. The driver asks him what he\u0027s laughing about \u0026 Bellingham tells him that a person like Andy would never know the difference between one ancient scroll and another - the scroll he reads is the actual one from the mummy.

Drogan tells Halston that he has an unusual mark for him to dispatch: a black cat. The cat has supposedly killed Halston\u0027s sisters, Carolyn and Amanda. Both sisters had befriended the cat, feeding it and showing it affection over Drogan\u0027s objections that it was evil. Carolyn was killed when the cat, sitting on a staircase riser, tripped over it and fell to her death. Amanda had been killed when the cat laid on her face while she was asleep.Halston is skeptical.

He now believes the cat has been sent to take revenge on him and his family.Drogan leaves the house, bidding Halston to kill the cat by the time he comes home and also suggesting he not get angry, which will cloud his ability to kill it. Drogan checks over his weapons and tries several methods of killing the cat, all of which fail. When the cat leaps at him and scratches his neck, Halston becomes furious. At one point he tricks the cat into approaching and eating from a dish of food - he uses a laser sighting scope to target the cat, fires his pistol and misses.

Preston shrinks in terror, begging for his life. The gargoyle makes him promise that he\u0027ll never speak of what he saw or the creature that committed the murder. The gargoyle also slashes Preston\u0027s body as a reminder. Preston promises to keep his vow and the beast flies off.On his way home Preston meets a beautiful woman, Carola.

He shows her a small sculpture of the gargoyle he\u0027d kept hidden. When Carola sees it, she lets out a mournful scream and begins to transform, saying that Preston had broken his promise - she, herself, is the gargoyle.

The next scene opens to a nocturnal image of a fog-shrouded cemetery. The lonely figure of the Emperor (Criswell) walks towards a marble altar, sits, and then summons his \"Princess of the Night\", the Black Ghoul (Fawn Silver), who appears and bows before him. The Emperor warns that if the night\u0027s entertainment fails to please him, he will banish the souls of the entertainers to eternal damnation, indicating that he is an all-powerful demonic being.As the full moon appears, the Black Ghoul summons the first dancer of the night, a Native American woman (Bunny Glaser). The Black Ghoul explains that this woman loved flames, and that both she and her lovers died in flames. The woman dances and strips before the flames of the cemetery. The Black Ghoul then introduces the second dancer of the night, a street walker in life. While the woman dances, Bob and Shirley make their way to the cemetery and start observing the dance from a distance. Shirley suspects that they are observing a college initiation, though Bob seriously doubts her theory.The Emperor himself summons the third dancer, a woman who worshiped gold above else. The Golden Girl (Pat Barrington) dances in her turn, and the Emperor instructs his loin-clothed servants to reward her with gold. The supposed reward is soon revealed to be a punishment, as the servants place her in a cauldron with liquid gold. What emerges from the cauldron is a golden statue of the living woman who entered. The servants transport the immobile statue to a nearby crypt.At this point, a werewolf (John Andrews) and mummy (Louis Ojena) appear and seize the intruding young couple. They are brought before the Emperor who decides to postpone deciding their fate. The intruders are tied up, side by side, and allowed to continue watching the dances. The Black Ghoul next introduces the fourth dancer, a \"Cat Woman\" (Texas Starr). She is depicted as a woman dressed in a leopard costume, which exposes her chest area. As she dances, a servant follows her around and thrashes her with a bullwhip. Offering a sadomasochistic show for the spectators.The Emperor next calls for a Slave Girl (Nadejda Dobrev) to be whipped for his amusement. The slave wears a tunic and is chained to a wall. Following her torture session, the Slave Girl breaks free and becomes the fifth dancer of the night. Later, the Black Ghoul exhibits a fascination with Shirley and scratches a mark on her. She draws a knife and seems about to kill Shirley, when the Emperor decides it is not yet time for the intruders to properly join them. The female ghoul reluctantly obeys.The Emperor is puzzled when a human skull appears instead of the next dancer. The Black Ghoul explains it is the symbol of the sixth dancer, who loved bullfighting and matadors. She used to dance over their demise, and now it\u0027s time to dance over her own. The dancer of apparent Spanish/Mexican heritage (Stephanie Jones) appears to perform. The Emperor and Ghoul briefly discuss the past of the dancer, who came to them on the Day of the Dead.The seventh dancer appears dressed in Polynesian garments. The Black Ghoul describes her as a worshiper of snakes, smoke, and flames. A rattlesnake is depicted along with her dance. The camera shifts to the mummy and the werewolf. The mummy voices his dislike of snakes and recalls the death of Cleopatra. He informs his companion that ancient Egypt had many snakes and they were the stuff of nightmares.   The Emperor next expresses his boredom and demands \"unusual\" entertainment, while the Black Ghoul notes that the night is almost over. She reminds her superior that they will be gone at the first sight of the morning sun. They proceed to argue over the fate of Shirley.The argument ends with the introduction of the eighth dancer (Barbara Nordin), a woman who murdered her husband on their wedding night. She dances with the skeleton of her spouse. The argument over Shirley then resumes, as the Ghoul claims her for her own. The Emperor feels the need to assert his own authority over the Black Ghoul.The ninth dancer (Dene Starnes) was a zombie in life and remains zombie-like in death. The tenth and final dancer (Rene De Beau) is introduced as one who died for feathers, fur, and fluff. She starts her dance in clothing matching this style. When the final dance ends, the Emperor finally offers Shirley to the Ghoul. The Ghoul briefly dances herself as she prepares to claim her prize. But dawn arrives and with it sunlight. The Emperor and all his undead are reduced to bones.The final scene has Bob and Shirley waking up at the scene of the accident, surrounded by paramedics, suggesting it was all a dream. Criswell appears in his coffin to offer parting words to the audience.","Weighted Degree":"2.0","numvotes":"2955","productioncompany":"Astra Productions","countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"2.9","originaltitle":"Orgy of the Dead","size":"1","genres":"Fantasy,Horror","storyline":"Bob and his girlfriend Shirley go in search of a cemetery in order to inspire John for writing his next horror story.

He is a Professor of English at the University of Southern California. He explains that there are just a few areas left on Earth that are unknown and briefly describes a few theories that postulate there may be places deep under the surface of the Earth where man can survive.In Asia an archeological dig has discovered something. Dr. Roger Bentley (John Agar) and Prof. Etienne Lafarge (Nestor Paiva) expose a stone tablet. They take it back to their tent to clean and examine it. We are introduced to Dr. Jud Bellamin (Hugh Beaumont) and Dr. Paul Stuart (Phil Chambers) who ask Bentley to translate the find: it may be related to the story of Gilgamesh and Ishtar. An earthquake rattles the area and the tablet is broken. This puts their work a month behind schedule. A small boy discovers something the earthquake brought down a mountain and brings it to Bentley. He cleans it and it is revealed to be an ancient oil lamp. The inscription is translated as a pre-biblical Noah\u0027s Ark story. The party of scientists set off for the mountain where the artifact originated before it was dislodged by the earthquake.They set up base camp and plan their final assault on the mountain the next day. A storm hits the base camp that evening. As they set off the next morning an avalanche brings down an arm from a statue. They continue climbing and discover the ruins of an ancient Sumarian civilization on a small plateau. They estimate the ruins are 5,000 years old. While Dr. Stuart walks around the ruins he falls down through an opening. The rest of the party goes down on ropes to save him. Bentley leads the way, followed by Lafarge, who is much older than the rest. Bellamin is third down the opening followed by Nazar (Rodd Redwing). After dropping down about 200 feet Bentley finds Stuart, but he died in the fall. Nazar notices a loose piton and hammers it secure, but that triggers a rockfall and he is killed and the three archeologists are trapped.They start searching for a way out, but Lafarge is experiencing breathing problems. He is also claustrophobic, They wander through the cave and discover a light source, which reveals a large underground city. They notice a very large tablet that informs them they have discovered the temple of Ishtar. They bed down for the night, but a lizard creature (a mole person?) digs up to the surface to spy on the three. A short time later, the party is attacked, sacks are placed over their heads, and they are pulled underground. They awake in a cave and Lafarge has claw marks on his chest. Two very pale white representative of the human underground civilization suddenly appear and direct they follow them. The scientists are escorted back to the city and presented to the High Priest, Ilinu (Alan Napier) who is performing a ritual. Ilinu immediately suspects the strangers and tells the king that they are evil. The king questions the three archeologists. At the conclusion of the questioning the high priest sentences them to death.The three escape into a cave, with guards in hot pursuit. Bentley shines his flashlight in the face of the First Officer (Robin Hughes) who cringes and retreats. It seems the light hurts their eyes. The three return to the city and shine their flashlight on the King and High Priest and they also retreat. The inhabitants of the city are albino, adapted to a world without sunlight. A lizard creature pulls the body of one of the guards underground. Seeing this, Lafarge panics and runs back into one of the caves. Bentley and Bellamin follow and discover a slave labor camp where the lizard creatures are forced to cultivate the food source--mushrooms. The guards whip their charges, which particularly incenses Bentley. Laforge is attacked and killed by a lizard creature, but is driven off by the flashlight before he can eat Laforge.Bentley and Bellamin return to the city and are met by the high priest along the way who tells them that they are welcome back to the city since they \"possess the divine fire of Ishtar\". The King is convinced they are holy messengers and are invited to a feast. One of the servers, Adad (Cynthia Patrick) drops her bowl of mushrooms, and is ordered whipped by the king. Bentley stops the punishment and is told not to interfere by the High Priest. Bentley helps her to her feet and notices she is not albino, but normally pigmented. The King presents Adad as a gift to Bentley. The High Priest explains that she is not human (like them) but a \"marked one\". The King and Priest further explain that when the population gets too large the excess are sacrificed in the fire of Ishtar.Bentley and Adad talk about their respective worlds as the High Priest spies on them. The next day Bentley and Bellamin tour the city. Meanwhile the High Priest meets with his fellow priests and plots to get the flashlight. This will show the king that the strangers are not divine, but mere mortals.Bentley and Bellamin intercede when three lizard creatures are being beaten, but their flashlight batteries begin to fail. They free the lizard creatures. Food production has been reduced because the lizard creatures are rebelling against their mistreatment. The High Priest schedules another sacrifice. After a ritual dance three women are escorted into a brightly lit chamber, enter, and are locked in. When they open the chamber later, the charred remains are carried out on stretchers. The High Priest is shown the dead body of Laforge. The High Priest was told by Bentley that Laforge was called back to Ishtar, reinforcing the story of his divinity. The High Priest shows the body to the king and explains that he is mortal and asks the King for permission to kill Bentley and Bellamin. The King agrees. Bentley and Bellamin are drugged and arrested. Elinu takes possession of the flashlight. Adad escapes and is captured by the lizard creatures. Bentley and Bellamin are taken to the lighted sacrifice chamber and locked in. The lizard creatures attack the city in force and kill the inhabitants, including the King and High Priest.The lizard creatures break open the sacrifice chamber, but the light repels them. Adad isn\u0027t afraid of the light and joins Bentley and Bellamin on their ascent back to their world. They reach the top and get into warmer clothes. Another earthquake strikes the area, and Adad is killed when a stone pillar crushes her. The underground city is buried.","Weighted Degree":"2.0","numvotes":"3435","productioncompany":"Universal International Pictures (UI)","countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"5.0","originaltitle":"The Mole People","size":"1","genres":"Adventure,Fantasy,Horror","storyline":"On an archaeological dig in Asia, Dr. Roger Bentley finds a cuneiform tablet referring to an ancient society, the Shadow Dynasty, that was destroyed.

A man in Egyptian fez and garb follows a suited man to his apartment building. The landlady lets the Egyptian in when he asks for a Mr. Dragore. In Dragore\u0027s room the Egyptian, Mahmoud, threatens Dragore (who is also Egyptian) with a knife. He demands a jewel, the Eternal Light. He wants to return it to the tomb from which it was stolen. Dragore says it is too late, he has sold it to a Professor Morant. They join forces to get it back.The next scene is at Professor Morlant\u0027s estate home, Eastvale. Morlant is on his death bed. He seems disfigured. A parson, Nigel Hartley, rings at the door but is abruptly turned away as he is told the professor is a pagan. The doctor comes out of the professor\u0027s bedroom after examining the professor and says to someone that he hasn\u0027t long to live and goes down stairs and talks to Morlant\u0027s solicitor, Mr. Broughton. Broughton sends the doctor across the hall to get a drink. Broughton looks in the professor\u0027s books and sees he paid 75,000 pounds for the Eternal Light, which leaves him little.Morlant asks for his manservant, Laing. He tells Laing that he wants the jewel buried with him as it will enable him to receive eternal life at the next full moon. Laing is against the idea but agrees. Morlant binds his hand with the jewel in his grip. Morlant also tells Laing to watch Broughton as he doesn\u0027t trust him. Later, Morlant dies. He is buried in a large mausoleum on the estate grounds. Someone is watching from the bushes but we can\u0027t see who. Laing removes the jewel from the professors hand and locks the tomb with the key left inside. Inside the house, Laing hides the jewel in a coffee container. He then looks up the address of a Miss Betty Morlant in the city. Miss Morlant, it turns out, is one of the professor\u0027s two heirs.Broughton leaves but tells his chauffeur, Davis, to stay behind outside and tail Laing if he leaves. Broughton seems to think Laing is going to steal the jewel. Laing now heads for \"Yoxford Station\" with Davis following.Back in the city at Broughton\u0027s office, the other heir, and Miss Morlant\u0027s cousin, Ralph Morlant learns that his uncle is almost penniless except for his house. Ralph decides to meet Betty and then go to Eastvale against Broughton\u0027s wishes.That night, Laing meets Betty in the street and hands her a note which she reads and then puts in her purse. The note says \"There is something of value at Eastvale and others are after it. Come quickly.\" Almost immediately the purse is stolen by Broughton (it\u0027s dark and she doesn\u0027t see who the thief was) and the note torn up, but the Aga has been loitering outside also, sees all this, and reads the torn up note.Inside, Ralph and Betty and Betty\u0027s friend Laney, who is sort of silly, decide to leave immediately for Eastvale.Back at the tomb we see someone planting explosives at the base of the door, and running a blasting cap under the foundations into the tomb. Broughton arrives at the house and begins looking for the jewel. Broughton answers the door and lets in Betty, Ralph, Laney, and the parson who has also wandered by. Aga Ben Dragore and Mahmoud also arrive. Mahmoud hides on the grounds with a knife and the Aga enters the house. The Aga wants to enter the tomb but is refused. Laney is quite taken with the Aga. Betty and Ralph, when alone, reconcile. Laing returns.Professor Morlant rises from the dead, sees the jewel has been stolen and staggers out, like a zombie, and begins his search for the jewel. He encounters Mahmoud and kills him.The Aga and Laney go to the kitchen to make coffee. They are interrupted by Laing who retrieves the jewel and hides it in Miss Betty\u0027s over-night case. The Aga goes outside and Laney gets scared and joins him. The professor encounters Laing and learns that Betty has the jewel. He strangles Laing into unconsciousness.Betty goes upstairs to her room with her case. The professor follows her and takes the jewel after a struggle. Looking inside a window, the Aga sees that the professor now has the jewel. Broughton and Ralph are arguing downstairs when Betty comes in and says what has happened and faints.The professor returns to the tomb with the jewel and Laing trails behind with the cousins. The Aga rids himself of Laney. In the tomb, the professor uses a knife to draw the sign of Anubis on his chest. He then places the jewel into the hand of the statue of Anubis and waits for something to happen. The cousins enter the tomb, without Laing who has refused to go with them. Anubis closes his hand to accept the jewel and the professor collapses, dead. But then the \"parson\" comes out from behind the statue with the jewel. He had placed his own hand inside the arm of Anubis. The \"parson\" Nigel Hartley points a pistol at Ralph but Ralph throws an object at him and knocks him unconscious. However the Aga now enters, also with a pistol and wants the jewel. He and Ralph fight and Ralph hurts the Aga\u0027s arm, but eventually the Aga shoots Ralph with a glancing blow to the head which knocks him unconscious. The Aga leaves, locking everyone inside the tomb, which now catches fire from one of the torches.Earlier, Ralph had called the professor\u0027s doctor and asked him to send the police. As they are driving toward the estate the doctor tells the police that he thinks Professor Morlant wasn\u0027t actually dead, that he had just suffered from an attack of catalepsy.The Aga runs into Laney and they argue and he slaps her. As he does so, the jewel falls out of his pocket, unknown to him, and Laney picks it up.The Aga runs out to a car but Broughton is in it and pulls a pistol on him and demands the Eternal Light. The Aga surrenders but then discovers he doesn\u0027t have it and they both see Laney has it. They chase her. She holds the jewel over a well and says that if they shoot her she\u0027ll drop the jewel in the well. They are stopped at first but then decide it might be okay if the jewel goes into the well as they can retrieve it. Just as they start to shoot her, the police arrive and disarm Broughton and Laney hands them the jewel.Back inside the tomb, just when everyone seems about to die, The fake parson, Nigel Hartley, comes to and detonates the explosives, which he had buried earlier which blows the door open.Ralph and Betty come staggering out of the tomb and kiss each other.The end.","Weighted Degree":"3.0","numvotes":"2754","productioncompany":"Gaumont British Picture Corporation","countriesoforigin":"United Kingdom","averagerating":"5.8","originaltitle":"The Ghoul","size":"1","genres":"Action,Drama,Horror","storyline":"Aga Ben Dragore, a knife-wielding, enigmatic Egyptian Arab, is seeking a sacred jewel which has been stolen from an ancient tomb.

He steps forward and observes a white statue of the Virgin Mary, with two streams of red tears flowing out of its eyes. As another priest greets him, you learn that the man is Father Andrew Kiernan, an investigator sent from the Vatican to determine the validity of divine occurrences. The priest explains to Father Kiernan that the tears began flowing when Father Almedia died; his body still on display in a coffin to the side of the statue. While Father Kiernan takes pictures and samples of the liquid, a small young boy steals the rosary wrapped around Father Almedia\u0027s hands in the coffin.In a local market, the boy sells the rosary to an older white woman, while a local stall vendor warns them that it isn\u0027t right to steal from the dead.In Pittsburg, Frankie Paige (Patricia Arquette) lives a fast and free lifestyle, working at a hair salon and partying with her friends at clubs. After a long night of partying, she wakes up to a phone call from her mother. Her mom was the lady at the Brazilian market, and had sent Frankie a package of trinkets and gifts from her travels - the rosary among the presents. Frankie gives the gifts a cursory look, and stares at the rosary after she hangs up the phone. While examining the rosary, she suddenly feels extremely nauseous and vomits.Meeting up with her friend before they head to work, they both consider the possibility that Frankie is pregnant. After a day at the salon, Frankie relaxes at home in a hot bath. Suddenly, a dove flies frantically around her apartment, and Frankie is suddenly thrown under the water in the bath, struggling with an unseen force. Flashes between nails being driving into a man\u0027s wrist, and wounds developing on Frankie\u0027s fill the screen.Her friend finds her at home in the bath with blood everywhere, and rushes her to the hospital. While a surgeon attempts to sew up the two wounds, she explains that they look like they were done by a single sharp object driven through her wrists. The staff believes they are self-inflicted, though Frankie denies it.Back in Rome, Father Kiernan comes back to give in his report about a Virgin Mary sighting in a wall in Brazil. He mentions the statue that he discovered, but is quickly directed to drop the subject by the head priest. Frustrated, the Father accepts the church\u0027s decision.Frankie and her friend are riding the subway home, when Frankie suddenly stands up from her seat to confront a priest at the end of the car. She asks the man if he is Andrew, and when he replies no, she swears, and suddenly the train runs wild. Passengers are thrown around the car, while Frankie is now being whipped on the back by an unseen force. Finding herself again at the hospital enduring rigorous tests, the doctors finally conclude that she may have a case of epilepsy. While leaving the hospital, the priest from the subway meets her in the waiting room, hands her his card, and says that when she is up to talking to him, he wants to ask her about \"stigmata.\"News of Frankie\u0027s \"attacks\" have made the papers, and the Vatican has decided to send Father Andrew Kiernan to Pittsburg, and investigate the occurrences. He is told to quiet the situation, and defuse any rumors of stigmata. Upon arrival, there is an instant connection between himself and Frankie. They have a coffee at the diner, while Father Andrew starts the interview. After Frankie explains that she isn\u0027t religious, and doesn\u0027t even believe in God, Father Andrew explains that what is happening cannot be stigmata, as it only afflicts the extremely devout. After showing the wounds on her wrist that still haven\u0027t healed, he looks confused, but still does not relent. Frankie storms out, frustrated that this glimmer of explanation and hope did not amount to anything.That night, Frankie meets her friend at their usual club. She is clearly distressed - feeling that God is doing this to her, and that she just wants everything to stop. After her friend tells her that she is losing it, Frankie storms off only to be halted by another attack - this time scratches and slashes on her forehead. Bloody and hurt, she runs from the club in the rain. She reaches her apartment door, and sees Father Andrew ringing her bell. He sees her, but Frankie runs. Father Andrew discovers her crouching on a car in an alleyway, scratching symbols into the paint with a broken bottle. He walks towards her, and Frankie stands up bellowing something in a foreign language in a man\u0027s voice. She collapses, and Father Andrew carries her into her apartment. Father Andrew calls his friend in Rome and replays the phrase Frankie yelled - the friend explains that it is an ancient dialect of Aramaic - the language of Jesus.","Weighted Degree":"2.0","numvotes":"67832","productioncompany":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM)","countriesoforigin":"United States, Mexico","averagerating":"6.2","originaltitle":"Stigmata","size":"1","genres":"Horror Only","storyline":"A priest from the Vatican is sent to Sao Paulo, Brazil to investigate the appearance of the face of the Virgin Mary on the side of a building.

Her ranting and raving finally begins to make sense to the priest who starts to question what his religion has stood for for the last 1900 years. —Jeff Mellinger \u003cjmell@uclink4.berkeley.edu\u003e","Clustering Coefficient":"0.0","genre":"Horror Only","Number of triangles":"0"},"color":"rgb(90,104,47)","size":50.163936614990234},{"label":"An Angel for Satan","x":454.8334655761719,"y":668.1795654296875,"id":"tt0060109","attributes":{"year":"1966","runtimeminutes":"90","Weighted Degree":"4.0","numvotes":"678","productioncompany":"Discobolo Film","countriesoforigin":"Italy","averagerating":"6.5","originaltitle":"Un angelo per Satana","size":"2","genres":"Horror,Mystery","storyline":"At the end of the 19th century, in a little Italian village by a lake an old statue is recovered.

She vanishes into the night, leaving Andy intrigued - unaware that she is the daughter of David Kessler and Alex Price, the couple seen 16 years earlier in the first film. That night, Andy, Chris, and Brad attend a night club called \"Club de la Lune\".

Serafine arrives, tells Andy to run away and transforms into a werewolf. Claudes henchman transform into werewolves as well, and slaughter all the guests. Chris escapes and goes back to Serafine\u0027s house. Brad is killed by a werewolf, and Andy is bitten by another werewolf when he tries to escape.The next day, Andy wakes up at Serafine\u0027s house. Serafine blends organs in the blender, and he is still in shock, but Serafine allows him to feel her breasts to calm him down. She tells him he\u0027s transforming into a werewolf. This is interrupted by the sudden appearance of the ghost of Serafine\u0027s mother Alex. Andy jumps out the window in sheer panic and begins running away. Chris tries to get his attention, but Claude grabs him and holds his hand over his mouth and takes him back to his club. Soon, Brad\u0027s ghost appears to Andy and explains Andy\u0027s werewolf condition. For Andy to become normal again, he must eat the heart of the werewolf that bit him; and, for Brad\u0027s ghost to be at rest, the werewolf that killed him must be killed, too. After developing an appetite for raw meat, Andy hooks up with an American tourist named Amy (Julie Bowen), but he transforms and kills her. Andy also kills a cop who had been tailing him, suspecting Andy was involved in the Club de la Lune massacre. Andy is arrested but escapes. He begins to see Amy\u0027s ghost as well, and she begins trying to kill him.Claude and his henchmen kidnap Andy to join their society but to prove his loyalty, Andy must kill Chris. Serafine rescues Andy, explaining that her stepfather prepared a drug to control werewolf transformations. However, the drug forces werewolves to immediately transform into their beast form. As a result, she killed her mother and savaged her stepfather. Claude and the other werewolves raid Serafine\u0027s stepfather\u0027s lab and kill him, taking the drug to transform immediately.Serafine and Andy learn of a Fourth of July party Claude has planned and infiltrate it as well as the police. Serafine manages to kill the bouncer (who has blocked the entrance with a bulldozer) by dropping a stone statue on him from outside the church. Claude and his men transformer and several partygoers are killed as well as cops. They help the partygoers escape, and Andy manages to kill the werewolf that ate Brad\u0027s heart, thus setting Brad free. Police reinforcements arrive, and a fight ensues. Andy and Serafine pursue the werewolves into the catacombs as well as the police resulting in the death of the Chief of police, with Serafine shifting to her werewolf form to fight when she runs out of ammunition. During a fight between Serafine and another werewolf which she manages to kill, Andy shoots the werewolf, but it turns out that it was Serafine. Injured and in alot of pain she begs him to kill her with a switchblade but he is unable to as he loves her, and police who arrive on the scene assume that he is trying to kill her before he escapes to go after Claude as he\u0027s the last werewolf.

Realizing what he\u0027s done a terrified Claude tried to run away but Andy turns out to be quicker jumps on top of Claude transforms into a werewolf, kills him and eats his heart and howls, breaking the werewolf curse over him. Serafine is taken in an ambulance, but she begins to show signs of transforming. The EMT, thinking she is going into shock, administers adrenaline, which stops the transformation. The sedative, which was thought to be the \"cure\", actually triggered the change and adrenaline has the opposite effect.The final scene depicts Serafine and Andy celebrating their wedding atop the Statue of Liberty with Andy\u0027s pal Chris, who survived. The couple seem to be controlling the curse with a steady application of adrenaline-fueled activities. They bungee jump off the statue as the credits roll.In an alternate ending, after Andy eats Claude\u0027s heart, Serafine has a vision of her stepfather in the back of an ambulance, explaining how he found a cure before his death.

When another nun tries to get her to come down, Maureen accidentally pushes her over the railing to her death. Another nun tells Maureen that she will burn in hell for what she did. She is forced to leave the convent after this ordeal.She walks through the desert for a while, and finally reaches a highway. A beat-up car approaches and passes her, but backs up upon seeing her. The driver, Duane Duke (Jeff Fahey) offers her a ride. She puts her suitcase in the backseat and in doing so, bumps his guitar. He tells her to be careful with it, because it is his \"bread and butter\"--he is on his way to Los Angeles to make it big as a rock-n\u0027-roll singer. She says that she\u0027s having car problems, and that the problem is that there is no car.They continue driving into the night during a heavy rainstorm. Duane can barely see ahead of him but keeps on driving aggressively, and the car begins to weave between the lanes. The car is having engine problems, and a loud popping sound causes Duane to swerve the car to the other side of the road. Duane pulls the car off the road, and tells Maureen that they aren\u0027t going any further, due to the storm. He advises her to try to get some sleep. During the middle of the night, it is still raining, and Duane makes a pass at her. She struggles to fight him off, and slaps his face. She gets out of the car, and he angrily tosses her suitcase out into a muddy puddle. Duane drives off, leaving Maureen sobbing.The next morning at the Bates Motel, Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) collects some dead birds in a paper sack from the ground, thanks to some poisoned birdseed he kept in a birdfeeder, and stuffs them in the kitchen using his taxidermy supplies. On the table is a newspaper opened up to an article entitled, \"Spool Still Missing.\" Norman has a flashback of him killing Emma Spool (Claudia Bryar, from the end of Psycho II), and when he looks down at the bird he is stitching up, he instead sees a hand and arm being stitched together! He is startled when the paper sack moves along the tabletop by itself, and is relieved to see a healthy bird pop out. Norman carefully grasps the bird in his hands and releases it outside. He hears a car horn blaring, and comes down to meet Duane. Duane is interested in the \"help wanted\" sign posted on the office window. Norman offers him a job as an assistant manager for the motel, and Duane accepts, mentioning that he only wants to stay long enough to earn money to fix his car to go to L.A.Norman goes off to the diner (Statlers) where he used to work to get some food. At the diner, Ralph Statler (Robert Alan Browne)--the owner--is having a conversation with Sheriff John Hunt (Hugh Gillin) about Emma Spool. He is confused as to why she would suddenly not show up for work a month ago and disappear, after normally being a stellar employee since he took over the diner from the previous owner, Harvey Leach (Hugo L. Stanger) seven years earlier. --Sheriff Hunt says that her apartment has been searched and nothing seems out of the ordinary. Ralph hopes that nothing serious has happened to her, displaying a worried look on his face. Tracy Veneble (Roberta Maxwell), a nosy magazine reporter, chimes in and suggests that Norman may have had something to do with her disappearance. She came from L.A. to interview Norman about the subject of the insanity defense and the rehabilitation of mentally ill murderers.Sheriff Hunt and Ralph argue with her and tell her to leave him alone in peace. Just then, Norman walks in and sits down in a booth. He orders a meal and gets an order of burgers to go. Tracy sits down across from him and starts to ask him some questions. He opens up to her and explains that what happened to him in the past stays with him and he can\u0027t escape the reality of what he did. As they are talking, Maureen gets out of a semi truck and comes into the diner. Norman is horrified to see her initials on her suitcase--\"M.C.\" Norman has a flashback to the murder of Marion Crane from 22 years earlier-he notices that Maureen is almost an exact look-alike to Marion. He pays for the food and quickly leaves while Tracy keeps droning on and on.Back at the motel, Duane sees an exhausted Maureen walking toward the highway. He apologizes to her for his behavior the night before (he says he was road-weary) and offers her a motel room that she can rest in. She pays him $25 for the room, and he gives her the key to cabin #1. As she leaves, Duane keeps the $5 bill she gave him, folds over the edge of one corner, and puts it in his pocket. Norman walks by and sees her going into the room. He freaks out and goes back to the house. Norman has a conversation with \"Mother (Virginia Gregg\u0027s voice),\" the stuffed corpse of Mrs. Spool. He tells \"her\" about Maureen resembling Marion, and \"she\" tells him to get rid of her if her presence upsets him. He refuses, and Mother says that maybe she will do it instead.Maureen unpacks her suitcase in cabin 1. She sees a copy of the Bible on the nightstand, and she has a traumatic memory of her actions at the convent. She starts to cry. In Fairvale, Duane goes into a bar and sees Tracy Veneble. He introduces himself to her and lights her cigarette for her. She initially is turned off by him, but when she sees his Bates Motel matchbook, she decides to have a talk with him.In the motel office parlor, Norman takes a picture off the wall, and looks through a peephole into cabin 1. He sees Maureen stripping and going into the bathroom nude. Norman goes back up to the house and puts on his \"Mother\" costume and goes back to cabin 1 to kill her. Maureen is in the shower, and \"Mother\" pulls back the shower curtain. Maureen is sitting in a tub of rising bloody water. A razor blade sits nearby. She lifts up her hands to reveal that her wrists were slit, with blood gushing out of the wounds. Due to her blood loss, Maureen hallucinates that \"Mother\" is the Virgin Mary coming to save her.Meanwhile, Duane and Tracy continue talking about Norman. Tracy says she will pay Duane for any information he gives her. Unexpectedly, she gets up and leaves. Duane notices a red-haired girl (Juliette Cummins) staring at him.At St. Matthew\u0027s Hospital, Maureen is in a room recovering from her suicide attempt. Father Brian (Gary Bayer), a psychiatrist, is sitting by her bedside and introduces himself to her. Outside her room, Norman and Sheriff Hunt are waiting. Tracy shows up and claims that she happened to be passing by the motel and saw the ambulance leaving and decided to follow it. She asks how Norman found out about Maureen. Sheriff Hunt chimes in and says he was bringing fresh towels to Maureen\u0027s motel room when he found her in the bathtub after she cut her wrists and he used her room phone to call for an ambulance, repeating what Norman had told him. Father Brian comes out and tells Norman that Maureen wants to see him.Maureen thanks Norman for finding her and calling for help. He is just glad that he was looking out for someone else. He tells her that she can stay at the motel for free as long as she wants until she gets better and can sort her life out. He leaves her room to let her rest, and goes back home. He accuses Mother of hurting Maureen, and says that he is glad that Maureen didn\u0027t die. Mother replies, \"She will!\"Duane brings the red-haired girl back to the motel. They overhear Norman yelling at Mother. They just assume the noise is due to a loud TV. Red tries to open the ice chest next to the office to get some ice, but it is locked. She bumps into Norman and falls to the ground. He opens the chest for her and she gets some ice and asks him to join her and Duane; he politely declines.Red and Duane make love, and later she comes out of the shower. She goes over to Duane to kiss some more and he isn\u0027t interested anymore. She is upset because she wants this relationship to be more than just a one-night fling, and he tells her to leave and gives her $5 for cab fare, the same $5 that Maureen used to help pay for cabin #1. He tosses her and her clothes out the door. She puts her clothes on and goes into to a phone booth nearby to call for a cab. She realizes she put her shirt on backward and takes it off to put it back on correctly. Suddenly, Mother\u0027s hand bursts through the glass door, opens it, and stabs her over and over again. Red struggles to fight off Mother\u0027s attack, and she severely cuts the bottoms of her bare feet from stumbling on the glass shards on the floor, blood squishing out. Red crumples to the ground and Mother turns around and leaves. Back at the house, Norman cries, \"Mother! Oh God, Mother! Blood! Blood!\"The next morning, Duane comes out of his cabin and sees Norman scrubbing the glass walls of the phone booth with soapy water. Duane goes into the office and sees that the $5 bill he gave Red for cab fare is in the cash drawer.At the hospital, Maureen is having a counseling session with Father Brian. She tells him that it was her idea to become a nun, but that as the time grew close to take her final vows of celibacy, she became scared and was dwelling on lustful thoughts. Father Brian asks her why she didn\u0027t just leave the novitiate, rather than be tormented by those thoughts.Duane talks to Tracy at the motel about the $5 bill he discovered in the drawer. She tells him it may have helped solve the mystery if he knew the girl\u0027s name. The motel is bustling with activity because Fairvale\u0027s homecoming football game is later in the day, and several guests have checked into rooms. Norman and Maureen arrive in a cab, and he sees Tracy going up to the house. She wants to continue her interview with him, but he stops her and tells her to leave and never come back. Norman goes into cabin 1, and Maureen is pleased to find that Norman had her wet clothes sent to the dry-cleaner\u0027s. He tells her that she\u0027ll look good in her pink dress on their dinner date later on.At Mrs. Spool\u0027s apartment, Tracy talks with the landlord. He says that other than coming and going for work, Mrs. Spool stayed home. The landlord leaves, and Tracy decides to stay and snoop for a while. She glances at some magazines on a coffee table and a single phone number is written on the covers several times. She dials the number on the phone, and she discovers that it connects her to the Bates Motel.That evening, Norman takes Maureen out to eat at a fancy restaurant in Fairview. After eating, they get up to dance. At first, Maureen doesn\u0027t feel comfortable, but Norman teaches her the basic \"box\" step movements.Back at the motel, a cab drops Maureen and Norman off. Maureen goes into her room, and Norman follows soon after. He sees her staring toward the house. He asks her what is wrong, and she says that she must have had too much to drink--she thought she saw a woman up in the window at the house. Uncomfortable, Norman goes to tell Duane that he can take off for the night, and then goes back to Maureen. She tells him she enjoyed her time with him earlier. They lay down on the bed and kiss. Norman stops kissing her, and he says he doesn\u0027t feel right about this. Maureen eases his discomfort by suggesting they just lie on the bed and hold each other.Later that night, Maureen is asleep and Norman is gone. Patsy Boyle (Katt Shea Reuben), a guest from another cabin, comes in to wake her and warns her about the door being left wide open. She tells Maureen that she\u0027ll close it for her, in case one of her drunk friends might happen to wander inside.Up at the house, Mother scolds Norman for letting Maureen come between them. She starts whispering something to him, and he is about to put on the dress and wig. Maureen comes up to the front door and calls out his name. Mother tells him to bring her the knife. He is shocked to see her dead body sit up in bed. Norman takes the knife in his hand, wraps his fingers around the blade, and slams his hand down on a table. He yelps in pain. Concerned, Maureen asks what is wrong. He feigns ill, and tells her to go back to her cabin and lock her door. Soon after, Norman leaves, dressed to kill.Meanwhile, Patsy Boyle is looking for a bathroom to use. She sees the one in the parlor, and sits down on the toilet to relieve herself. Suddenly, she looks up in surprise and sees Mother standing directly in front of her. She tells Mother that the bathroom is \"occupied,\" and Mother thrusts the knife, slitting her throat, and stabbing her in the stomach. Patsy keels over and falls to the floor. Later, Norman goes into the parlor looking for Duane, and he recoils in shock from seeing the bloody mess. Norman takes her body out of the bathroom and tosses it out the window behind the motel. Some partiers are chasing each other around the building, and Norman hides himself and the body momentarily. The guests all get into their cars and leave, burning rubber on their way out to the highway.The next morning, Maureen comes out of her cabin to see the sheriff\u0027s car outside. Worried, she asks about Norman. Tracy is there too, and she decides it\u0027s time to tell Maureen the truth about Norman. Sheriff Hunt and Deputy Leo (Steve Guevara) are investigating the disappearance of Patsy Boyle. She didn\u0027t ride home with the other revelers, and they go up to the house where they question Norman about it. Norman figures that Tracy assumed he was involved. Deputy Leo searches the first floor level, and then goes to search upstairs. Terrified that they\u0027ll discover Mrs. Spool\u0027s corpse, Norman runs up after him, with Sheriff Hunt in pursuit. Norman sees that there is no body in Mother\u0027s room. Bewildered by Norman\u0027s antics, Hunt and Leo leave.Shortly after, Norman is sitting by the ice machine by the motel. Sheriff Hunt apologizes to Norman for their intrusion, and he opens the ice chest to grab a couple of ice cubes to suck on. There are human fingers sticking up out of the ice, but he doesn\u0027t see them. He puts bloody ice cubes in his mouth (he doesn\u0027t notice this-he grabs them without looking at them) and vehemently ignores Tracy\u0027s pleas to take Norman in for questioning about the disappearances of Mrs. Spool and Patsy, because there is no proof that he did anything. Maureen lies to Hunt, and claims that she was with Norman until 6:00 that morning, so he couldn\u0027t have done anything wrong. Hunt and Leo leave, and Tracy waits for Maureen to get in her car--she told her everything about Norman, and Maureen tells a disappointed Norman that she\u0027ll stay with Father Brian for a while. They drive off.Norman looks around the house looking for Mother. She is nowhere to be found. In the kitchen, he sees a note from Mother: \"Norman--I\u0027m in cabin 12. Come see me.\" Norman walks along the front of the motel and approaches cabin 12, which is Duane\u0027s cabin. On the TV is a Woody Woodpecker cartoon. Mother is sitting in front of the TV. On the bed, Duane--high on drugs and alcohol--plays his guitar.\"What are you doing with my mother?\" Norman asks him.Duane replies, \"Don\u0027t you mean, Mummy?\" in a mocking tone. Norman asks him why he took her and left the note for him to find.\"I\u0027m just looking out for you Norman,\" says Duane.\"And yourself,\" Norman says.Duane continues, \"I have ambitions--dreams, but dreams don\u0027t come cheap these days. I could\u0027ve turned \u0027mom\u0027 over to the cops this afternoon, but all I would\u0027ve gotten was a pat on the back for doing my civic duty.\" He tells her that Tracy would\u0027ve payed him a big sum of money, but figures that she would lie and take all the credit and earn a big salary and earn a news position somewhere.Duane blackmails Norman into selling the house and motel in order to give Mother over to Norman. Norman tells him that he wants Mother back. Duane tells him he can take her--Duane says, \"You know what I want, and you know what I\u0027ll do if I don\u0027t get it.\"Norman hits Duane in the head with an ashtray. A violent fight breaks out with Norman hitting Duane with a lamp, and ultimately, hitting Duane with his own guitar. \"Watch the guitar,\" Duane mumbles. Norman hits him with the guitar repeatedly, until the guitar is broken into several pieces. Duane crumples to the floor, unconscious.At the diner, Ralph, Myrna (Lee Garlington)--a waitress, and Tracy are discussing Mrs. Spool. Ralph tells Tracy that Mrs. Spool was a good employee, and was already working there when Ralph bought the place. Tracy asks about the diner\u0027s former owner, Harvey Leach, in the hopes that she can find out more about Mrs. Spool from him. Myrna says that Harvey is in a nursing home outside of town. Tracy visits Harvey, and she asks him about Mrs. Spool. He tells her that Emma had been put in an asylum for killing someone.At Father Brian\u0027s office, Maureen has decided to forgive Norman and wants to be back with him. She has failed other people before, but she won\u0027t fail him.At a library, Tracy looks through old archived newspaper articles, and is shocked to see a headline reading: \"Sister arrested in Bates Murder-Kidnapping.\" Below it is a sub-heading: \"Child Unharmed in Love Triangle Tragedy.\"In Duane\u0027s motel room, Norman removes his belongings and wraps his body in the shower curtain. \"I\u0027ll be back for you mother,\" Norman says. Norman opens the ice chest and tries to remove Patsy\u0027s body from it. One of her arms is wedged against the top of the chest and won\u0027t move, and Norman tries with all his strength to pull it loose, but the arm snaps off. He finally gets the body out of the ice chest, and he kisses her on the lips before putting her in the trunk of Duane\u0027s car. Norman puts Duane\u0027s body in the back seat of the car and drives it over to the swamp. On the way, Duane wakes up and wraps a cord around Norman\u0027s neck. Startled, Norman slams his foot down on the brake pedal and the momentum causes Duane to lurch forward into the front passenger seat.Norman pins Duane down on the floor of the car with his foot, and the other foot accidentally presses down on the gas pedal, sending the car into the swamp. As the car fills with water, Norman sees Duane drowning. Norman manages to escape the flooding car and swims away from it. He struggles to see in the murky water, navigating through underwater weeds. He lets out a scream when he sees Red\u0027s body--her pale, expressionless face staring back at him. He surfaces, and crawls his way out of the swamp.Meanwhile, Tracy shows copies of the newspaper articles to Father Brian, hoping that if Maureen would see them, she could change her story to the police. He tells her Maureen already left and went back to the motel.In her room, Maureen has showered and put on a nightgown. She hears Norman running up the steps to the house, and she calls out to him. He ignores her and runs into the house. She walks up to the house and enters it. As she walks up the staircase, she calls out to Norman again and explains that she has returned. She says that she never should have left and she forgives him for what happened to him in the past, and emphasizes that he saved her life. Norman appears at the top of the stairs. She asks him what happened. He lies and says that he slipped in the mud.She says that she regrets hurting him by leaving, and asks for his forgiveness. They hold each other\u0027s hands and have a brief tender moment. Suddenly, Mother yells, \"Norman!\" Surprised by this, Norman lets go of Maureen\u0027s hands, sending her falling backward down the stairs, arms flailing. At the bottom of the stairs, her skull is pierced by the arrow of the cupid statue against the wall. She crumples to the floor... dead. Norman, in shock, runs down the stairs and sees that blood is pooling around her head. He angrily yells \"Mother!!\" at the top of his lungs.Tracy drives up to the motel, and, carrying a tire iron, checks Maureen\u0027s cabin. She overhears Mother saying to Norman, \"You get that whore out of my house. Throw it out in the muck and filth where she belongs!\" Norman says, \"I\u0027ll get you for this, Mother.\" Mother replies back, \"You haven\u0027t got the guts, boy!\"Tracy goes up to the house and tries to open the front door, but it\u0027s locked. She goes around the back and enters the kitchen. She slowly walks through the hallway into the foyer, and sees the living room lit up with dozens of candles. She sees Maureen\u0027s body laying on the couch, with a lit candle positioned in her grasped hands. With pity, she says, \"You dumb, stupid naive girl.\" She turns around and is shocked to see Norman dressed up as Mother, his mouth fixed in a wide, skeletal smile. \"Why can\u0027t you leave my poor son, my Norman, alone?\" says Mother. Tracy drops the tire iron and tries to escape from him. She begins to go up the stairs, with Norman slowly in pursuit.\"What set you off again, Norman? Was it Mrs. Spool? You killed her, didn\u0027t you? What did she do--come to you and tell you she was your mother? She was crazy, Norman--she wasn\u0027t your mother, and neither are you!\" She reaches the tops of the stairs, Norman still following her. \"Mrs. Spool was your aunt, Norman. She was in love with your father, but your mother stole him away from her! Emma Spool killed your father in a jealous rage and kidnapped you when you were just a baby!\" In Mother\u0027s room, she turns around and lets out a horrified shriek when she sees Mrs. Spool\u0027s corpse sitting in a chair. \"She killed your father because she thought you were her child--the child she should have had with him! She was crazy--they locked her away!\"Mother says, \"It\u0027s lies! It\u0027s all lies! She\u0027s a lying whore. She\u0027s a slut! Don\u0027t let her talk about me like that!\" Norman, seemingly free of Mother\u0027s spell, takes off the wig and dress. \"Get her boy, get her! Just like all the others!\" continues Mother. Norman raises the knife, and it looks as though he is going to attack Tracy, but instead, Norman stabs Mrs. Spool\u0027s body at the neck. \"Norman! Can\u0027t you do anything right?\" says Mother. Norman continues hacking at the neck, with sawdust spraying out. \"How dare you treat your mother that way!\" The corpse slides out of the chair and onto the floor. Norman hacks with the knife until the head is completely severed and rolls to the side. \"So I don\u0027t have the guts, huh?\" taunts Norman. Exhausted, Norman rests his head on the chair.The next morning, Sheriff Hunt leads Norman away from the house in handcuffs. A TV news crew is there filming. Tracy and Father Brian are both in shock. Hunt is in total disbelief with Norman, telling him that he believed in him and had faith in him and now that Norman, as \"Mother\" killed more people. He puts Norman in the back of the squad car, and tells him, \"You\u0027ll never get out again! They\u0027ll lock you up forever!\" In response, Norman replies, \"But I\u0027ll be free. I\u0027ll finally be free.\"As the squad car drives along the highway, Norman reaches into his jacket pocket and pulls out a victory trophy: the severed rotting hand of Mrs. Spool. He gently caresses it as he smiles as the image fades to black.","Weighted Degree":"3.0","numvotes":"14400","productioncompany":"Universal Pictures","countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"5.4","originaltitle":"Psycho III","size":"1","genres":"Horror,Mystery,Thriller","storyline":"Norman Bates is back again running his \"quiet\" little motel a month after the events in Psycho II.

His brother, Jason (Mike Vogel), and his girlfriend, Lily (Jessica Lucas) throw a surprise going-away party for him. Rob\u0027s best friend, Hud (T.J. Miller) is recruited to videotape the event but spends much of his time trying to hit on Marlena (Lizzy Caplan). Rob is uncomfortable when Beth (Odette Yustman) brings a date to the party. Rob and Beth have been friends for a long time and had recently had an affair; their date to Coney Island was recorded on the videotape that Hud is now using to record the party. Rob ended the affair abruptly when he got the job. At the party, he insults Beth, who storms out.Jason and Hud take Rob aside to lecture him about his boorish behavior and encourage him to never let go of those he loves most. Just then, a shock jolts their apartment building. The party rushes to the roof to see what is going on. In the distance they see an explosion and must flee back inside the building to avoid debris. Once they move down to the street, Hud continues to shoot video and captures the image of a monstrous shadow moving down the street several blocks away. The monster knocks over the Woolworth Building, sending a cloud of debris billowing down the street. As everyone decides to evacuate Manhattan by going over the Brooklyn Bridge, Marlena informs Lily that she saw smaller creatures attacking and eating people.As they attempt to cross the bridge, Rob receives a call from Beth. She is at her apartment in the Time Warner Center and apparently injured. Jason becomes separated from the others. As they try to make their way to him, the monster\u0027s tail appears out of the gloom and destroys the bridge. Jason is killed but Rob, Hud, Lily, and Marlena make it to safety. In an electronics store, Hud sees footage of the monster shedding parasite creatures from its back that in turn attack people on the street. Rob decides to rescue Beth, even though it means he will have to avoid the monster. Lily, Hud and Marlena agree to go with him. As they move uptown, the heavily armed military appears to fight the monster as it smashes through buildings just ahead of them.The four take refuge in a subway tunnel and decide to walk the tracks to the Warner Center. In the darkened tunnel, they see scurrying rats and hear unsettling noises. Using the night vision function on the camera, they see the scale creatures crawling along the walls. They try to run but the monsters attack; one bites Marlena. The four barricade themselves in a breakroom. After tending Marlena\u0027s wounds and waiting for the creatures to leave, they walk up into a subway station just outside Bloomingdale\u0027s.The military is using Bloomingdale\u0027s as headquarters. Rob pleads for help in finding Beth. Suddenly, Marlena begins bleeding from her eyes and mouth; shortly thereafter her abdomen explodes. A sympathetic soldier tells the others where they should bring Beth if they rescue her -- the last helicopters leave within the hour as the government has determined the only option for controlling the monster is the carpet bombing Manhattan. When they arrive at Beth\u0027s apartment building, they learn that it as collapsed onto the tower opposite it. Making their way up the standing tower, they then crawl into the collapsed tower and rescue Beth.Rob, Hud, Lily and Beth make it to a helipad as a battle rages against the monster all around them. Lily is pushed into one helicopter and the others into the last. Although an aerial bombardment seems to knock the monster over, it suddenly reaches up out of the debris and strikes their helicopter. It crashes into Central Park. The monster sneaks up on them and bites Hud in half. Rob and Beth grab the camera and take shelter under a foot bridge. They record their final goodbyes on the camera as the bridge collapses around them under the air force\u0027s assault.Epilogue. The military has found the tape several days later. Its final moment is from the trip Rob and Beth took to Coney Island. In it, an object can be seen falling from the sky into the ocean, unknown to Rob or Beth.*The following is all from the POV of Hud\u0027s video camera.The movie starts off with Rob videotaping the start of a typical New York day from an apartment in the North Tower of the Time Warner Center. He goes into the bedroom and chats with Beth, whom he has just slept with. The two agree to go to Coney Island for the day.The tape cuts to Rob\u0027s brother, Jason, as he attempts to get the same camera working. His girlfriend Lily tasks him with documenting Rob\u0027s going away party, and Jason passes the task on to his and Rob\u0027s friend Hudson (Hud). Hud obliges, and takes the camera and begins filming the party.During the party, Beth arrives with a date, much to the disappointment of Rob. The two argue, and when Hud asks Lily why, she reluctantly tells him and Jason about Rob and Beth sleeping together. Hud proceeds to tell a number of guests, and Beth leaves. Rob frustrates her even more by wishing \"luck\" to Beth\u0027s date as they leave.Shortly afterwards, the ground shakes and loud roars are heard in the area. The guests of the party go to the roof and look downtown, and see a large explosion in the vicinity. Flaming debris flies towards the roof, and the guests run downstairs and begin to pile into the street. There is another roar and the head of the Statue of Liberty flies through the streets, landing near Hud. Hud walks over to it, then finds Rob, Jason and Lily and the four watch as the Woolworth Building suddenly collapses. They run into a shop to escape the debris. Minutes later, they exit the shop, and find their friend Marlena - whom Hud has a crush on - babbling about \"it\" \"eating people\".After discussing what they saw and concluding that a giant creature is roaming the city, the five friends decide to make to leave the island. They are cut off, however, when the monster destroys the Brooklyn Bridge, killing Jason in the process. They run back into the city and go into an electronics store so that Rob can try and find a battery for his mobile phone. He finds one and gets a message on his phone from Beth, who is trapped in her apartment. Meanwhile, Hud watches the news and sees live images of the monster rubbing its back against buildings and dropping dog-sized parasites on the ground. The parasites start attacking people. Rob, however, decides to try and help Beth, and the friends all agree to follow him.They make their way further north, towards midtown, and have an up-close encounter with the monster when the army comes and tries to shoot it down. The group panic, and run into a subway to try and escape. When they are below the streets, they discover that they can get to the other side of Central Park from Beth\u0027s apartment by following the train tracks and then turning west down Central Park South, and begin to walk through the tunnels. They are ambushed by the parasites during their walk, and during the attack Marlena gets badly bitten by one. They hastily climb into the abandoned Bloomingdale\u0027s via the 59th Street subway station. They are led by a squad of infantry to an army field hospital, which was set up to care for the hundreds of wounded civilians scattered around the city.Shortly after arriving at the hospital, Marlena is dragged behind a paramedics screen and we see her silhouette gruesomely expand and then explode, some sort of viral effect brought on by the bite she received. Some of the parasites, both alive and dead, are shown in containment cages being examined by a few white-coated scientists. The group are permitted by the sergeant to leave and try and help Beth, but to report at a military evacuation zone by 06:00 that morning. Hud has a minor break-down as they leave, but pulls himself together and they continue towards Columbus Circle in order to help Beth.When they reach the Time Warner Center, they find that the north tower has been pushed over and is leaning against the south tower. Hud suggests that they climb the stairs in the south tower and try and find a way onto the roof of the north one, and they manage to get themselves to Beth\u0027s apartment. When they get there, they find Beth lying on the floor with her shoulder impaled by a length of rebar. The group pull her up, and lead her back down to street level. They briefly see the monster again as they cross the roof of the north tower, and have another encounter with a parasite as the go down the stairwell. Rob stabs it with a fire axe and the four manage to escape. As they run to the evacuation zone - which is just by Grand Central Station - they see the monster step right over the station as they run by it. They hastily try and get on a helicopter, and are separated from Lily, who is put on a different helicopter. Hud, Beth and Rob get on the next helicopter, and begin to evacuate.As they fly over the city, they witness the monster being bombed by various planes and finally get knocked down into a building and under a cloud of smoke. As Hud shouts in joy, the monster suddenly rears up and smashes the rear rotor of the helicopter, sending the chopper circling towards the ground. It lands in Central Park and the group wake up a couple of minutes later, and help each other get out. The pilots are briefly seen in the helicopter dead.Rob injures his leg in the crash, and Hud puts the camera down to help him get away, but when he goes to retrieve it the monster suddenly steps over him and looks down at the camera. Rob and Beth look on from behind the helicopter as the monster bends down and scoops Hud up in its mouth, and for a few seconds the camera is inside the creature\u0027s mouth. The top part of Hud falls out of its mouth - camera and all - and Rob and Beth run over to him sobbing.Rob picks up the camera and carries it with him and Beth, and the two collapse under a bridge near the south eastern corner of the park. They sit there and listen as the bomb-warning siren goes off in the city, and Rob makes a last testimonial to the camera. As he quietly comforts Beth, a bomb drops on the park and the camera gets knocked out of Rob\u0027s hand, getting buried beneath some rubble. Rob and Beth each proclaim their love for each other just before another bomb goes off.The camera pauses, and then cuts to a shot of the ocean from the Coney Island Ferris Wheel. In the far distance, you can briefly see a Japanese satellite fall from the sky and crash into the ocean - a part of the film\u0027s viral marketing campaign. Rob turns the camera back towards him and Beth, and then zooms in on Beth\u0027s face. She says \"I had a good day.\" and then the tape freezes on her smiling face, and cuts to black.At the very end of the credits, there is a short static transmission that, when played backwards, says \"It\u0027s still alive.\"","Weighted Degree":"2.0","numvotes":"390728","productioncompany":"Paramount Pictures","countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"7.0","originaltitle":"Cloverfield","size":"1","genres":"Action,Horror,Sci-Fi","storyline":"To celebrate Rob\u0027s massive promotion, his lover, Beth, and friends, decide to throw a massive surprise farewell party, now that he is about to move to Japan.

Confederate troops led by a man named Jasper (Jack Huston) bring in a few runaway slaves. One of them, Amara (Achok Majak), runs away again in terror after watching the other men strap a device to another slave, Eli (Tongayi Chirisa). Jasper chases after Amara on horseback and brings her down by lassoing a noose around her neck. She begs to be killed instead of returned to the antebellum, and Jasper obliges her by shooting her in the head.One of the captured women, Eden (Janelle Monae), is brought into the home of her owner, a Confederate general known only as \"Him\" (Eric Lange). He beats Eden and orders her to say her name. When she cannot, Him grabs a branding iron and burns it into her back, causing her to scream in agony before weakly crying out her name.Six weeks later, a new group of black people are brought in to the plantation. Jasper orders the group to not speak unless they are given permission. Jasper\u0027s wife Elizabeth (Jena Malone) brings her daughter (Arabella Landrum) to pick one of the women in the group, whom the little girl names Julia (Kiersey Clemons). When Eden takes Julia with her, she asks Eden where they are and what is happening, but Eden tells her to keep quiet.Eli goes to Eden\u0027s house later to ask when they can escape again, but Eden appears to have given up hope. She walks carefully across the floor to see which boards do not make noises when stepped on. Julia then goes to her home, where she seems to already know who Eden really is. She wants to try and escape as well, as she is pregnant, but Eden shows her the branding scar to show that it is better not to anger the people in charge. Julia expresses disappointment in Eden, saying she is not a leader.The slaves are forced to work during a gathering of Him and his troops, where he boasts about preserving their way of life for the future. Two young soldiers, Purcell (T.C. Matherne) and Daniel (Robert Aramayo), observe Julia, and Daniel expresses attraction toward her. Purcell encourages him to speak to her, and Jasper comes in and orders Julia to wait in Daniel\u0027s cabin. When Daniel goes to find her later, Julia tries to appeal to what she thinks is his innocent nature since he appeared to be kinder than the other men, but he proves to be just as terrible when he strikes Julia for speaking to him without permission. He kicks her in the stomach before leaving.The next day on the plantation, Julia suffers a miscarriage. She cries out in pain and distress, and Eden goes to help her. Jasper attempts to antagonize them, but Eli keeps him back briefly by calling him a cracker. After letting Eden help Julia, Jasper confronts Eli over the matter, with the other soldiers getting ready to fire if they need to, but he instead sends Eli to clean out the shed. There, he finds the burnt remains of Amara, which he recognizes from her cross necklace. Eli breaks down.That night, Eden tries to sleep. She starts to hear what sounds like a cell phone ringing. She then appears to wake up from what seemed like a bad dream. Here, Eden is revealed to be an author and activist named Veronica Henley, married to Nick (Marque Richardson) with a daughter, Kennedi (London Boyce), all of whom live in present day Atlanta, Georgia. Veronica is well noted for speaking out against the treatment of black Americans, causing her to butt heads with pundits. As she is preparing for an upcoming trip, she sits to have a video conference with another woman... and it\u0027s Elizabeth. She uses condescendingly racist dialogue while discussing Veronica\u0027s book and its themes. Elizabeth also describes herself as a \"talent scout\" while noticing Kennedi, which makes Veronica uncomfortable.After going off on her trip, Veronica meets up with one of her best friends, Dawn (Gabourey Sidibe), as she visits Veronica\u0027s hotel room. She expresses to Dawn some of her frustrations and insecurities with her home life. After Dawn leaves, a mysterious man arrives to bring Veronica flowers but won\u0027t say who they are from. Based on the note that\u0027s left, she assumes they\u0027re from Nick.Veronica steps out of her room and runs into her other close friend Sarah (Lily Cowles), who is joining her and Dawn later that night for dinner and drinks. Meanwhile, Elizabeth sneaks into Veronica\u0027s room, tries on her lipstick, and walks around the room to observe before turning the tag on her door so she won\u0027t get turn-down service. Veronica then attends a conference where she speaks before an audience of black women, all of whom are moved and inspired by her words. As she goes back up to her room, the girl that appeared to be Elizabeth\u0027s daughter is in the elevator with her and creepily tells her she shouldn\u0027t speak unless given permission, but Veronica thinks it\u0027s just a game.Veronica later joins Dawn and Sarah. On the ride to the restaurant, Veronica talks to Nick and thanks him for the flowers, but he says it must have been a fan. Dawn is abrasive toward the staff since she demands the best table and wine. During the night, an unseen man (implied to be Jasper) watches the women all night until he sends a vodka cranberry to Dawn. He then approaches her personally to compliment her, and while flattered, she takes the time to critique his attempt, since she thinks that drink pales in comparison to the wine they are celebrating with, but she gives the man her number just in case. The ladies then prepare to part ways, with Veronica heading into an Uber. Midway through the trip, Veronica gets a call from a woman who says she is her driver waiting outside the restaurant, but she thinks there\u0027s a mistake. Veronica then looks at the driver to see that it\u0027s Elizabeth. Jasper then appears from behind her to grab her. Veronica struggles to break free, but he ultimately knocks her out.Veronica wakes up back on the plantation, where she is still hearing the phone ring. Outside, Him - actually Senator Blake Denton - answers the phone and speaks to someone over how Nick has been all over the news with Kennedi searching for Veronica, and he promises to take care of it. Veronica pretends to be asleep while Denton says he won\u0027t let anyone take her away from him.The next day, Veronica finds that Julia has hung herself. In her despair, she decides that tonight will be the night that they escape. She waits until Denton has fallen asleep, and she manages to sneak outside quietly. Eli finds her and helps her get the cell phone to call for help. They try to make it to the cabin to get a signal, but Purcell and Daniel are out after drinking, forcing the other two to hide and drop the phone. Daniel picks it up, and after Purcell leaves, he stops to urinate. Eli cracks him in the face and leaves Daniel to choke on his blood while they get the phone. They try to make it to the cabin, but Denton attacks the two of them. A fight ensues with Eli hitting Denton to keep him off Veronica, but Denton kills Eli with a hatchet. Veronica hits Denton with a tea kettle before getting his phone. Denton steps out but Veronica stabs him in the gut with a bayonet. She unlocks his phone and manages to call Nick and let him know she is alive, and she sends him a location pin to give to the police. Veronica then goes to Eli\u0027s body and addresses him by his real name, Professor Tarasai.Veronica rolls Denton into a confederate flag and brings him to the shed. He weakly tells her that there will still be more like them, but she scoffs at him. As she goes to get a torch, Jasper finds her, but she tells him that Denton is hurt. Jasper and another guard run into the shed, where Veronica locks them in there and sets the logs on fire to burn all three of them to death. She then rides on horseback as the other soldiers give chase through the woods. After losing most of them, Elizabeth pursues Veronica on her horse. She taunts Veronica and states that Denton (who was really her father) personally picked Veronica because she went against his whole campaign and agenda, while Elizabeth picked everyone else herself. Veronica lassos a noose around Elizabeth\u0027s neck, but Elizabeth slashes at Veronica multiple times until Veronica gains the upper hand and beats Elizabeth\u0027s face. Veronica then rides the horse while pulling Elizabeth until she slams her head against a statue, breaking her neck.Veronica continues to ride as the sun rises and the soldiers continue their re-enacting. She rides outside the gates of the plantation, where it\u0027s revealed that Antebellum is a Civil War re-enactment park. Veronica rides out on her horse to find other people, just as the police arrive, and she appears relieved. The police and feds rescue the kidnapped black people and bulldoze Antebellum to the ground.","Weighted Degree":"3.0","numvotes":"25050","productioncompany":"Lionsgate","countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"5.7","originaltitle":"Antebellum","size":"1","genres":"Drama,Horror,Mystery","storyline":"Successful author Veronica Henley finds herself trapped in a horrifying reality and must uncover the mind-bending mystery before it\u0027s too late.","Clustering Coefficient":"0.0","genre":"Drama","Number of triangles":"0"},"color":"rgb(87,51,45)","size":44.426231384277344},{"label":"Don\u0027t Knock Twice","x":892.6082153320312,"y":431.6119384765625,"id":"tt3622110","attributes":{"year":"2016","runtimeminutes":"93","Weighted Degree":"6.0","numvotes":"13656","productioncompany":"Red \u0026 Black Films","countriesoforigin":"United Kingdom","averagerating":"5.1","originaltitle":"Don\u0027t Knock Twice","size":"2","genres":"Drama,Fantasy,Horror","storyline":"The sculptor Jess unsuccessfully tries to retrieve the custody of her teenage daughter Chloe.

Janet is starting to feel ill at ease considering how far out they are and that a bunch of bikers keep passing them on the road and suggests that they should turn back before something bad happens. We hear a loud BANG! and the car skids to a stop.Brad realizes he messed up badly by not refilling the spare tire and suggests that the two of them go to an old castle they passed along the way to call for help. Janet isn\u0027t so sure this is a good idea, but Brad talks her into it anyway as there\u0027s not much they can do otherwise. As they walk through the rain, Janet tries to shield herself with a newspaper, telling herself through a song that no matter how bad things get, there\u0027s always a good side and that things will always get better. (\u0027There\u0027s a Light... over at the Frankenstein Place\u0027)Soon the two arrive on the front doorstep of the castle. Brad knocks and just as the two were about to leave, the door is opened by Riffraff (Richard O\u0027Brien), a tall, gaunt, balding butler in a stark black suit. He glares at them, further unnerving Janet, though Brad tries to be friendly, introducing himself and Janet and explaining that they need a phone as their car has broken down nearby.The foyer is outlandishly decorated with dark wooden furniture, stuffed dead animals and hunting trophies, and random relics and curiosities. Riffraff explains to Brad and Janet that they\u0027ve arrived on a very special night as \"the master\" is having a party, where Brad and Janet meet the equally strainge house maid Magenta (Patricia Quinn), which leads into the infamous song \"The Time Warp\".The Criminologist comes on and explains the steps to the \u0027Time Warp\u0027 dance.Brad and Janet are ushered into a great hall with a throne and a jukebox at it\u0027s far end where conventionists of every size and description wearing tuxedos and party hats are dancing and singing the (\u0027Time Warp\u0027). During the song we are introduced to the gold-sequin-wearing, tap dancing Columbia (Little Nell). All of this is too much for Janet and Brad who try to sneak out carefully. Janet begs Brad to leave as the place is creepy, but Brad simply says that they should stay to watch more \"folk dancing.\" Janet refuses as she\u0027s \"cold, wet and just plain scared!\", though Brad tries to reassure her.Janet turns around to leave and sees Dr. Frank N. Furter (Tim Curry) in full drag regalia, wrapped up in a black cloak. She screams and faints. Frank introduces himself though a song as a (\u0027Sweet Transvestite\u0027) from Transsexual, Transylvania\". Brad asks him for help, explaining his plight, and Frank smirks and acknowledges that yeah, Brad needs help, and offers him a mechanic at first only to change his mind as \"Maybe the rain isn\u0027t REALLY to blame\" and instead decides to \"remove the cause but NOT the symptoms.\"Frank then goes into an elevator and rises upstairs to the applause of the partying conventionists. Riffraff and Magenta strip Brad and Janet down to their underwear. Brad and Janet then are prodded into the elevator and taken upstairs to Frank\u0027s laboratory.Brad and Janet are led out into the center of an observing room where they are put on display by Dr. Frank N. Furter, now wearing a lab coat and long surgical gloves. The Transylvanian conventionists watch the events from an above balcony. Frank N. Furter then walks over to a box-like shape covered by a tarp and throws off the covering to reveal a tank. He shouts for Magenta and Riffraff to set the controls and start the machinery as the room darkens. Frank himself laughs maniacally as he turns knobs, dials, and wheels as fluids pour into the tank and a humanoid form appears slowly, skeleton first, much to Janet and Brad\u0027s terror.Carefully, Frank N. Furter leads out the humanoid figure wrapped entirely in bandages and cuts them away to reveal a full-grown man with blond hair, tanned skin, blue eyes and a muscular figure wearing only a skimpy golden bikini over his crotch. Riffraff spins some wheels he shouldn\u0027t have while cackling to himself, setting the blond man, known as Rocky Horror (Peter Hinwood), loose. Frank chases Rocky through the lab crying his name as a bouncy song about the creation (\u0027I Can Make You a Man\u0027), Rocky feeling a sense of dread plays. Eventually Frank catches Rocky and scolds him for misbehaving, but says he forgives him as he\u0027s beautiful (\u0027Sword of Damocles\u0027).Then, the deep freeze malfunctions and Columbia squeals, \"Eddie!\" A burly, heavyset biker named Eddie (Meatloaf) rides out on a motorcycle, dressed in black leather, singing about his former glory (\u0027Whatever Happened to Saturday Night?/Hot Patootie\u0027) The conventionists eat it up, enjoying the show, but Frank becomes wrathful that Eddie stole his thunder and takes out a pickax, chasing Eddie into the deep freeze where he is hacked to bits. This puts everyone, even the giddy conventionists into a shocked and somber mood. Frank, tires to pick things up by talking about how beautiful Rocky is in a song (\u0027I Can Make You a Man, reprise\u0027), leading away his new creation to a \"bedchamber\" in a wedding-style procession.The Criminologist comes on again and mentions that Brad and Janet are in trouble now as they are being led away to separate rooms for the night.While separated, Frank N. Furter comes into Janet\u0027s bedroom, dressed as Brad, and seduces Janet. Then he goes into Brad\u0027s room, dressed as Janet and tries to seduce Brad. Brad puts up a little bit of a fight, but is talked into it. Afterwards, Janet feels frightened and used and goes to look for Brad. Meanwhile, Rocky escapes from the bedchamber and is running loose, chased by dogs through the rain outside the castle by the gleeful Riffraff. While wandering the castle lost and afraid, Janet encounters Rocky hiding in his tank at the lab. Seeing that he\u0027s injured, she tears her petticoat to bandage his wounds, pausing as she realizes she\u0027s aroused.The Criminologist comes on and mentions the complexity of human emotions and the dangers of lust. He fades away to Magenta and Columbia who are secretly watching Rocky and Janet in the tank via a monitor in their room.Janet tries to seduce Rocky, explaining that she used to be a virgin, but now she finds she really likes sex and wants it NOW (\u0027Toucha Toucha Touch Me\u0027). Rocky is more than happy to oblige. Meanwhile, Columbia and Magenta watch in secret from the closed circuited TV, laughing and playing with one another, making fun of the events unfolding before them.As the two women enjoy one another, Frank N. Furter beats up Riffraff for letting Rocky loose, while Brad watches with horror. An alarm goes off and Riffraff looks on another TV monitor and mentions that someone is outside by the main gate as they all look and see a middle aged man in a wheelchair buzzing the intercom at the front gate. Dr. Everett Scott (Jonathan Adams) has arrived at the castle. Brad recognizes his old teacher and is happy to see him, but Frank N. Furter is angry that the two know one another, recognizing Dr. Scott as a federal agent investigating UFOs, suspecting Brad and Janet are actually spies. Brad denies this, explaining that Dr. Scott is his science teacher from Denton High, but Frank doesn\u0027t believe him.Meanwhile, Dr. Scott enters the castle and finds himself alone in the \u0027zen room\u0027 filled with various smoldering insence. Frank N. Furter takes Brad to the lab where he turns on a powerful magnet to drag Dr Scott\u0027s wheelchair up to them... with Dr. Scott still inside it. The clunk of Dr. Scott\u0027s wheelchair arriving wakes the sleeping Janet and Rocky who sit up in shock. Everyone in the room is frightened, confused and hurt to see one another here. Magenta appears up and announces that dinner is ready. Attempting to handle things with grace, Dr. Frank N. Furter dismisses everyone for dinner, informing them that formal attire is optional as he stomps off enraged.Everyone meets in a grand dining room for a dinner of roasted beef and vegetables in honor of Rocky\u0027s Birthday. Frank demands that everyone sing Rocky \"Happy Birthday.\" Dr. Scott reveals in a song (\u0027Eddie\u0027s Teddy\u0027) that he\u0027s not here to investigate Frank and his household, but to look for his nephew, Eddie, who went missing with a cryptic cry for help in a letter being the last contact he had from him. Sure, Eddie was a no good kid, but he\u0027s still family. In response to this, the tablecloth is pulled off the table to reveal Eddie\u0027s hacked-up body in a glass case... and the fact that they were being served roast Eddie for dinner. Brad and Dr. Scott are paralyzed with terror, and Janet runs to Rocky\u0027s arms. Frank is outraged, slapping Janet. Janet runs away with Frank chasing after her, encouraging her through a song (\u0027Once in a While\u0027) to stop sleeping with everyone else as she\u0027s now his.Janet, followed by Frank N. Furter, Rocky, Brad, and Dr. Scott end up in the lab again. Frank pulls a switch to \"glue\" everyone\u0027s feet to the floor but his. Everyone tells Frank he\u0027s a \"Hot dog.\" In response, he simply flips a switch and turns them all to stone. Columbia comes in and tells Frank he\u0027s gone too far this time as now people are really hurt. Frank N Furter simply responds by turning Columbia to stone, too. He then tells Riffraff and Magenta to prepare for the floor show.The Criminologist comes on and hints that in this place where nothing\u0027s as it seems, the Floor Show is going to be something very shocking.The next scene we see the statue versions of everyone on stage, now all wearing fishnets, makeup, a thong and the same bustier. One by one they are unfrozen, and they each sing and dance a song (\u0027Floor Show\u0027) about how they\u0027ve changed since they came here. Rocky and Columbia sing about their past times (\u0027Rose Tint My World\u0027). Frank N. Furter, Brad and Janet sing their own version (\u0027Fanfare/Don\u0027t Dream It\u0027). Dr. Scott is accidentally unfrozen and realizes that this place is a trap and everyone should run while they still are sane enough to escape. Frank N. Furter comes out like a prized showgirl and sings a solo, starting an orgy in a swimming pool that is uncovered as he sings. After the orgy, Frank N. Furter sings a song praising his wild and untamed household (\u0027Wild and Untamed Thing\u0027).This song, however is interrupted by Riffraff and Magenta, now wearing strange uniforms and armed with laser ray guns. Riffraff informs Frank that it\u0027s all over as his mission was a failure due to Frank becoming too extreme. He declares that Frank is now his and Magenta\u0027s prisoner as he has been made commander, and that they\u0027re going back to their home planet of Transylvania in the Galaxy of Transexual immediately. Frank is happy for this, singing about how long he\u0027s been wanting to go back to the homeland he was exiled from (\u0027I\u0027m Going Home\u0027). Riffraff stops him again and explains that only he and Magenta are going home; Frank N. Furter is to be killed as Riffraff replies: \"say hello to oblivion\". Riffraff points a ray gun at Frank, but Columbia screams in an attempt to save Frank. Riffraff quickly turns around and kills her. Riffraff then kills Frank as he tries to run away. Rocky, seeing his creator fall, grabs Frank and climbs the set in the background of the stage, crying in rage and pain. It takes several shots from the ray gun, but Rocky is killed and falls into the pool where he and his creator float dead.Riffraff turns to Brad, Janet and Dr. Scott and tells them to leave now while they still can and they do so. Meanwhile, in a now empty house, Magenta and Riffraff celebrate going home as an incestuous relationship is implied. Brad and Janet, carrying Dr. Scott, escape just as the castle explodes and flies away under a rainbow and blue skies of dawn back to Riffraff and Magenta\u0027s home planet, leaving Dr. Scott, Janet, and Brad writing on the charred ground, still in drag from the floor show as it flies away into space. (In some versions the three of them sing one final song about loss of innocence called \u0027Superheros\u0027.)The Criminologist comes back one last time with the somber, iconic lines describing the flying away of the house:\"And crawling... on the planet\u0027s face... some insects... called the human race.

The astronomer is very much excited, and, rushing over to the large telescope he tries to discover by what means she had vanished. The moon now appears, and begins her repast by eating the immense telescope used by the astronomer. The astronomer flies around apparently wild at the loss of his wonderful telescope. Suddenly the moon opens wide her mouth and there comes forth a tot of about five summers. She is immediately followed by two others, and they proceed to dance around the astronomer, and vanish one at a time until but one is left. The astronomer, picking her up, thinking he could keep her, hugs her tightly in his arms, but she also vanishes. Tired and heart-broken the astronomer grasps a broom and attempts to strike the moon, when she suddenly vanishes and in the distance laughs at him, rolling his eyes forward and backward, apparently convulsed with laughter.

Elsewhere, Bernard Wong pays his workers extra money to continue digging his land after discovering human bones. The thugs are members of the Black Ninja Clan, whose dead are buried on Wong\u0027s site. One of their operatives strangles Gordon\u0027s girlfriend, believing she knows where Gordon has hidden the Golden Ninja statue that apparently gives him power and won\u0027t say, while another hires Ghost Ninja, a beautiful witch dressed in white to kill Wong, his daughter Fanny, her husband George, and her son, Bobo, for three million dollars. Fanny is frightened by a cat in the house upon move-in, and the Black Ninja leader keeps swinging her sword to hallucinate frogs jumping to their deaths out of her refrigerator and her soup ladle turning into a flying snake (strung on a wire that is highly visible without pausing despite being a split-second shot). The witch keeps spooking Fanny and Bobo, who insists on riding his bike in the living room, but George doesn\u0027t believe either of them. Gordon (sitting in front of a poster of a strangled woman marked \"this could happen to you\" and another poster of a swimsuit model) responds to their complaints (in shot-reverse shot, as they\u0027re obviously not in the same film) and commands Magic Chan, a wizard with a magic mirror he has forgotten, and his obese sidekick, Firecracker, in the same manor, and frequently keeps in touch on the phone after his Caucasian operative living next door, Sara, is murdered by a zombie man.

At first, their friend and current landlord Edward \"Hutch\" Hutchins (Maurice Evans) tries to dissuade them from doing so: the building has a rather unsavory past. It has been occupied by cannibal killers, Satanists and witches, such as the Trench Sisters, Keith Kennedy, Pearl Ames--and the sinister Adrian Marcato, who created a scandal in the late 1890s by claiming to have conjured \"The Living Devil.\"Rosemary and Guy decide to move in anyway. Guy is an actor with a fledgling career. He\u0027s done plenty of TV plays and commercials, which have made him good money; but he wants great parts. Rosemary is a gentle soul, originally from Omaha, Nebraska, where she had been raised in a Catholic home and had attended convent school.As it is, Rosemary is estranged from her family, since they don\u0027t accept her marriage to Guy, who is not only an actor, but is also of mixed Jewish/Protestant upbringing. So her life in New York is all she has: she is a young housewife dedicated entirely to making a good home for her husband, whom she adores. She has a good circle of friends, but is at core sweetly naïve and lonely.One day in the laundry room, Rosemary makes the acquaintance of Terry Gionnoffrio (Victoria Vetri), a young former drug addict who was \"rescued from the gutter\" by an elderly, eccentric couple, Roman and Minnie Castevet (Sidney Blackmer and Ruth Gordon). The Castavets\u0027s apartment had formerly been the front part of theirs, but is now separated by a partition.Her friendship with Terry is short-lived. A few days after Rosemary meets her, Terry plunges to her death from the bay window. She and Guy are walking home when they see the police surrounding Terry\u0027s corpse. The Castevets happen to be walking home, too. Presumably distraught, they strike up an acquaintance with the Woodhouses and later invite them to dinner. Rosemary becomes suspicious about their new elderly friends, particularly the way that Roman insists on speaking with Guy in private. Other things trouble her, too, such as when Guy\u0027s career gets a jump start when his main rival, Donald Baumgart, suddenly goes blind. Now all he cares about is his new play.But then suddenly, he decides he wants to become a father. Rosemary is thrilled. Evidently having studied her ovulation cycle himself, he announces the ideal \"baby night.\" That evening, Minnie drops by to give them some chocolate mousse -- or \"mouse\" as she calls it. Rosemary complains of a chalky undertaste, but Guy gets angry over her ingratitude. She eats part of it, and then furtively hides the rest in her napkin.Suddenly feeling disoriented after dinner, she passes out and has a bizarre dream. Rosemary is floating on a mattress in the sea, visits a cruise ship with the Kennedys, has her wedding band removed, is carried through the Sistine Chapel, a brief shot of the linen closet with guy saying \"easy, you got her too high\" then she\u0027s back on the cruise ship naked and told by the skipper go below the deck and passes by a burning church and lays down on a mattress. The unsettling dream becomes a nightmare when she finds herself surrounded by naked elderly people, a statue figure of a bearded man staring down at her, and two men tie her to a bed. Then Jackie Kennedy soothes her for not feeling well. Guy approaches her bed, but then something that looks and feels inhuman brutally rapes her. \"This is no dream!\" she cries. \"This is really happening!\" Pope Paul VI, then visiting NYC and having mass at Yankee Stadium, comes to offer her absolution.When she wakes up, Rosemary is sore and scratched. Guy half-heartedly apologizes for having had her while she was out. Rosemary is angry, but \"baby night\" later proves successful. Dr. C.C. Hill (Charles Grodin) -- referred to her by her girlfriend Elise Dunstan (Emmaline Henry) --   confirms it.Upon hearing the news, the Castevets persuade Rosemary to go to Dr. Abraham Sapirstein (Ralph Bellamy), a prominent obstetrician who delivers all the babies of the upper class in the city. Rosemary entrusts herself to him, accepting his odd advice and his recommendation of Minnie\u0027s strange \"vitamin drinks\" which include a rare herb, tannis root. She develops pain during her first trimester, which causes her to lose weight and look emaciated, alarming Hutch -- but not the doctor, Guy, the Castevets or their Saturday night gang of quaint old timers, including Dr. Stan Shand (Phil Leeds) and the obnoxious Laura-Louise McBurney (Patsy Kelly).As her pregnancy progresses, Rosemary feels a mounting sense of dread and angst, especially since no one close to her seems to want to acknowledge her pain. She decides to throw a party for her young friends, a qualification she insists upon. She also insists that they not invite the Castevets. Her girlfriends -- including Elise, Joan Jellico (Marianne Gordon) and Tiger Hoanigsen (Wende Wagner) -- tell her she looks awful and that her pain is far from normal. She has to see a new doctor. Rosemary tells Guy, and they fight bitterly over it, but at the last minute she relents. The pain has suddenly stopped. And she can now feel the baby kicking.Rosemary\u0027s friend Hutch drops by for a visit; Roman and Minnie spot him, and suddenly Guy arrives home unexpectedly, as if they\u0027d phoned him and urged him to rush back to the apartment. Hutch asks a lot of questions of Roman and Guy, and before he leaves the apartment, he realizes he\u0027s misplaced one of his gloves. Later, Hutch falls into a mysterious coma and dies. Rosemary receives a book from Hutch\u0027s companion, Grace Cardiff (Hanna Landy), which Hutch had intended to give to Rosemary personally. It\u0027s called \"All of Them Witches,\" a study on witchcraft through the ages, featuring a chapter on Adrian Marcato (his appearance is familiar from the \"dream\") and his son, Steven. \"The name is an anagram,\" is the final clue Hutch had left for her. Rosemary uses her Scrabble tiles to learn the horrible truth: \"Roman Castevet\" is an anagram for \"Steven Marcato.\"Now she suspects Roman, Minnie and all their all-too-helpful friends are Satan worshipers. She visits Dr. Sapirstein and tells him she\u0027ll have no more to do with them. It\u0027s just as well, Sapirstein informs her: Roman is dying and would like to go away to Europe on a farewell tour. Rosie feels guilty about her suspicions, and when the time comes, bids them a fond farewell.But not all is what it seems. As her due date -- June 28, 1966 -- nears, she learns one strange thing after the other. Could it be that Guy is involved with witches? Witches use babies for their rituals. Has he promised them the baby? She also learns that witches use the belongings of their intended victims to blind or kill them. On a hunch, she contacts Guy\u0027s former rival, Donald Baumgart, and gets him to reveal that Guy swapped neckties with him just before he went blind.Distraught, Rosemary packs a suitcase and goes to Dr. Sapirstein to tell him what she\u0027s learned. But his secretary\u0027s off-hand remark reveals something horrible -- the good doctor sometimes smells like tannis root, which she has learned is more commonly called Devil\u0027s Pepper. Dr. Sapirstein is a witch, too and must be part of the plot against her. Rosemary calls Dr. Hill from a payphone on the street and persuades him to see her. When she reveals her suspicions to him, he seems to take her seriously, and he gives her a sedative to help her sleep, but she is horrified when she awakens and find that Guy and Dr. Sapirstein have arrived to take her back home and Hill is unwilling to stop them, seemingly frightened of them. She manages lock them out of the apartment, but before she can call for help, Guy and the others appear in the apartment, having entered by some other means. Rosemary tries to fight them off and she goes into labor. They have to force her down on her bed, while Sapirstein injects her with a sedative.When she wakes, Guy tells her she has had a boy and that he\u0027s fine. Later, Sapirstein tells her that the baby is dead. The coven members sit with Rosemary, collecting her breast milk, and she thinks she can hear a baby crying through the walls of the apartment. She knows they have taken the baby, and she thinks they are planning to sacrifice it for one of their rituals.After a few days of pretending to cooperate and take her sedatives, Rosemary arms herself with a sharp butcher knife and finds the partition between her apartment and the apartment of the Castevets. Removing the closet interior, she finds the hidden doorway to the other apartment and steals inside. She looks at an oil painting of a burning church whispering \"you got her too high\", apparently having a flashback of the \"dream\". She discovers the entire coven sitting in the living room around a bassinet, including Minnie and Roman. A photo of Adrian Marcato is up above the mantle. There are other people there, too, that Rosemary does not recognize, people that seem to have come from as far away as Japan. She approaches the bassinet, which is adorned with an inverted cross, and sees the baby for the first time (not shown to the audience), horrified that the baby has strange eyes. \"He has his father\u0027s eyes,\" Roman tells her, and the coven tells her that Satan is the baby\u0027s father, not Guy. Guy finally tells her that he made an agreement with the coven to allow them to impregnate Rosemary with the spawn of the Devil in exchange for a successful acting career. Rosemary spits in his face and sinks into a chair, defeated. Minnie brings her a cup of tea. Roman speaks more gently to her and encourages her to be the baby\u0027s mother and does not need to join their evil coven. Although Rosemary hesitates at first, her maternal instincts win and she approaches the bassinet, telling the witch rocking it that she\u0027s rocking the baby too fast. The witch protests at first until Roman orders her to leave the crib. Rosemary begins to rock the baby and sings to it.","Weighted Degree":"1.0","numvotes":"209195","productioncompany":"William Castle Productions","countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"8.0","originaltitle":"Rosemary\u0027s Baby","size":"1","genres":"Drama,Horror","storyline":"Desirous of starting a family, the young Catholic housewife, Rosemary Woodhouse, and her struggling actor husband, Guy, move into the Bramford: New York\u0027s iconic building that brims with unpleasant stories of obscure dwellers and ghastly occurrences.

Carol, their very young daughter, is in bed right in the next room, but she is awake. Heartbroken, Lucy suffers a moment of fury and confusion that leads her to spontaneously pick up a nearby axe and decapitate her husband and his lover while they sleep. Carol watches in terror and shock as Lucy hacks the two bodies to pieces. Lucy is declared insane and sent to an asylum, where she endures traumatic shock treatments for her mental breakdown.The narrator of the flashback is revealed to be Carol, now a young woman. It is twenty years later, and Carol is opening up about her past to her boyfriend, Michael Fields. After Lucy\u0027s incarceration, Carol was taken in by her aunt and uncle, Bill and Emily, and the family lives on a farm in a rural location. Carol is revealing the family history to Michael because Lucy is being released from the asylum, and is coming to live with the family. When Lucy arrives, she is skittish. She cautiously acclimates to the farm, exploring the area with Carol and meeting the gritty-looking farm hand, Krause. But she is clearly thrilled to see Carol again, and is touched by the lovely young woman Carol has become. Carol is a sculptress and has a spacious studio filled with her work, and she thrills Lucy by giving her a bust of herself just as she was in her youth.Things quickly start to get strange. Carol shocks Lucy by presenting her with two bracelets she used to wear when she was a young woman, large dangling charm bracelets that jangle when she walks. Carol seems intent on recreating Lucy as a young woman, taking her clothes shopping and buying her a wig that mimics the hairstyle she wore the last time Carol saw her. Lucy is uncomfortable with this, but agrees to dress this way to please her daughter, whom she desperately wants to make amends with. While they are in the wig shop, Lucy hears strange voices, as if children are singing a morbid nursery rhyme about her crimes. She dismisses it as nerves. Later, she suffers a terrible nightmare and wakes up to discover two bloody heads in bed with her, with a bloody axe lying nearby. When she wakes the others, the items are gone from her room. Lucy starts to think she is relapsing.Things get worse when Carol attempts to introduce Michael to her mother. When Michael stops by for drinks, Lucy seems to try and seduce him, all with Carol right there in the room. The embarassing scene is interrupted by Lucy\u0027s former psychiatrist, Dr. Anderson, who makes an unexpected visit. When he sees how unstable Lucy seems, Dr. Anderson makes comments to the family that suggest he would like to take Lucy back to the hospital. When the doctor gets Lucy alone, his comments upset her and she runs off. As Dr. Anderson searches for her around the farm, he enters the darkened barn and a shadowy figure corners him--it appears to be Lucy, the silhouette revealing her hairstyle and figure, right down to the jangling bracelets she wears. The figure is holding an axe, and quickly decapitates Dr. Anderson.Carol returns to the farmhouse to find her mother alone in the darkened living room. The doctor\u0027s car is still outside, and Carol quickly comes to the conclusion that her mother has killed him. In a panic, Carol drives the doctor\u0027s car into a barn and locks it in, but she is spotted by Krause, who is lurking the shadows. The next day, Carol sees Krause painting the car a different color and angrily confronts him, but he smugly suggests that he knows what happened to the doctor, and that he\u0027ll turn Lucy in to the authorities if Carol fires him. Lucy overhears the conversation from the window. Later that evening, Krause is stalked and murdered with the axe.Lucy prepares for an evening that she dreads, a dinner party intended to introduce her to Michael\u0027s parents. If Michael and Carol are to be married, these will be their in-laws, and Michael\u0027s family is very wealthy, his father being the proprietor of a very successful dairy farm. Lucy has a panic attack in the powder room while at the Fields\u0027--after spilling coffee on her dress, she retreats to the washroom and suffers a flashback because of the wallpaper, which resembles the bars of a prison cell. Carol calms her down and takes her back to the party. Mr. \u0026 Mrs. Fields are cordial until they plot to get Lucy alone so they can have a private conversation with her: Mrs. Fields is suspicious of Lucy, and poor Lucy makes a terrible misstep by revealing to Mr. \u0026 Mrs. Fields that her daughter and Michael are planning to be married. The Fields had not been informed of this yet, and they react disapprovingly. Mrs. Fields in particular gets very haughty with Lucy, making suggestions about her past, and Lucy suddenly snaps at her, revealing that she was in an asylum for twenty years. She says that under no circumstances will she allow the Fields\u0027 to interfere with her daughter\u0027s happiness, and she storms out of the house.Michael drives Emily and Carol back to their house while he and Bill go out looking for Lucy, who has disappeared. Emily sends Carol to bed, but Carol is restless and cannot sleep. With Michael gone from the Fields\u0027 house, Mr. and Mrs. Fields are alone in their house and they hear sounds to suggest someone is prowling around. Mr. Fields is oblivious, but when he goes into his closet to get undressed for the evening, he is attacked by the figure of Lucy, brandishing an axe. Mrs. Fields becomes suspicious and goes looking for her husband, eventually finding his body in the dressing room. Horrified, she retreats, only to be confronted by the figure of Lucy in the bedroom. Before the axe can fall, the bedroom door opens and the real Lucy comes in; after scuffling with the other figure, Lucy tears off a mask to reveal her daughter\u0027s face underneath. Carol has been committing the murders while dressing as her mother; scarred by witnessing the double homicide committed by her mother, Carol\u0027s mind was unstable ever since. Certain that Mr. and Mrs. Fields would never allow Michael to marry her without a great deal of trouble, she plotted to make it appear as if Lucy murdered them in a rage, which would send Lucy back to the asylum and allow her to marry Michael. Her mind shattered, Carol clutches the mask of her mother and screams at it \"I hate you! I hate you! Oh I\u0027m sorry, I love you! I hate you! I love you!\" Outside on the porch, Lucy hears her daughter\u0027s insane ravings and weeps, perhaps remembering her own moment of insanity.An epilogue reveals Lucy discussing her plans with Bill. With Carol now committed to an asylum just as she once was, Lucy intends to stand by her daughter and be whatever kind of support that she needs.","Weighted Degree":"6.0","numvotes":"5667","productioncompany":"William Castle Productions","countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"6.8","originaltitle":"Strait-Jacket","size":"2","genres":"Drama,Horror,Thriller","storyline":"Lucy Harbin has been in an asylum for twenty years after axing her husband and his mistress during a crime of passion, witnessed by her young daughter, Carol.

That night, a strong wind blows a bottle of water over onto the rock, which begins to bubble and smolder. The next day, the head of the geological office, Dave Miller, returns to town from a business trip and finds the office destroyed by a huge growth of black rock and Ben dead, in a rock-hard, apparently petrified state. Meanwhile, Dave\u0027s girl friend, schoolteacher Cathy Barrett, brings her students to the desert, where little Ginny Simpson pockets a piece of the black rock, later washing it in a basin outside her parents\u0027 farm. In town, Doctor Reynolds performs an autopsy on Ben, but when he cannot explain Ben\u0027s rigidity, he informs Dave and Police Chief Dan Corey that he is shipping the body to a specialist. Martin returns to the demolished office with Dave, and there recognizes the rock formations as resembling the piece of black rock Ben had been examining. Cathy joins them and, also recognizing the rock, races with the men to the Simpson farm. They find it in ruins under a pile of black rock, and Ginny\u0027s parents dead. The girl, however, is in a catatonic state, and they rush her to the care of specialist Dr. Steve Hendricks, at the California Medical Research Center. He soon reports that she is slowly turning to stone, and posits that her only hope of survival lies with identifying the black rock within the next eight hours. Dave brings the rock to his old professor, Arthur Flanders, who assumes that it is from a meteor. Together they visit the Simpson farm, where Arthur notices a discoloration in the ground and deduces that the rock is draining silicon from whatever it touches, including humans. They then go to the desert, where they trace fragments of the rock to a huge meteor. Fretting that the meteor contains billions of years worth of space secrets, which they have only hours to discover, Dave sends the new information to Steve, who prepares a synthetic silicon solution and injects it into Ginny. While a storm brews outside, Dave and Arthur continue to investigate what causes the rock to grow, and after a piece of rock falls into the sink and begins to bubble, they realize that water is the culprit. Noticing the rain, they drive to the desert, where the small pieces of rock are mixing with water to form huge monoliths that rise from the earth and then crash into hundreds of pieces, each becoming another monolith. They report their findings to Dan, who plans to evacuate the town, even though the weather bureau reports that the rain will soon stop. At the hospital, Ginny finally stirs, and Dave deduces that Steve\u0027s silicon solution can be used to control the rocks. Soon, however, more locals are rushed to hospital in the throes of the petrification process, and the rock continues to grow. With little time to announce their findings to the town, Dave and Dan turn to Martin to round up the paperboys and spread the word. The governor soon declares a state of emergency, and Dave and Arthur struggle to convert the formula to one that will retard the rock growth, failing until they realize that the key lies in the simple saline solution Steve used on Ginny. While casualties mount, Dave figures out a way to dynamite the local dam and flood the nearby salt flats, thus creating a large supply of salty water near the canyon edge. Knowing that they must halt the rock\u0027s growth at the canyon edge or lose all hope of survival, Dave ignores the governor\u0027s refusal to give permission to the risky project, and sets up dynamite stations around the dam. Arthur doubts that the water will be able to absorb enough salt for the plan to work, but Martin cites hopeful statistics he has learned from years of reporting on the salt flats, and the team is cheered by his certainty. With only minutes left until the monoliths reach the canyon edge, Dan orders the dynamite to be detonated, and the group watches in fear as the water flows over the monoliths. The plan at first seems to fail, but finally the rock growth slows, and Dan holds Cathy as the last huge formation crashes to a standstill.","Weighted Degree":"3.0","numvotes":"3150","productioncompany":"Universal International Pictures (UI)","countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"6.4","originaltitle":"The Monolith Monsters","size":"1","genres":"Drama,Horror,Sci-Fi","storyline":"A strange black meteor crashes near the town of San Angelo and litters the countryside with fragments.

When MacVey tells Katie that Dickie had committed suicide two days ago, she shifts back into her usual speaking voice, and confusedly tells him that Dickie is not dead, claiming to have brought him home from the hospital herself.

A sign in front of the house gives its name as \"High Hopes.\"The film is based on the book of the same title, by Jay Anson, published in 1977. (Anson did not work extensively with the couple, but worked from hours of taped conversations between George and Kathy, which they had turned over to him.)The home features the Dutch gambrel (barn-shaped) roof design, and a pair of quarter-circle windows, on the end, on the 3rd floor, up near the roof. These are illuminated to look like the home\u0027s eyes. Filmmakers modified a house in New Jersey to look like the actual home in Amityville, and it is surprisingly close.It is a documented fact that a troubled young man, 28, had shot his entire family to death in the house, on 11/13/1974, including father, mother, two brothers and two sisters. Thus, in the film, the history of the house allows the Lutz\u0027s, in the fall of 1975, to make an offer of $80,000 on the home, which, we are told, is easily worth $120,000.Despite full disclosure of the home\u0027s past, by the realtor, the couple proceeds with the purchase, and moves in. George appears not to be strong of faith, but Kathy is at least a nominal Catholic. The couple turns to Father Delaney to bless the home. Father Delaney (Rod Steiger) encounters troubles in trying to bless the home, including a room full of flies, out of season, violent stomach sickness, and later, blisters on his palm when trying to make even a phone contact with Kathy at the home.In his further efforts to confront the evil, he suffers a car wreck from brake and steering malfunction, a lack of support by his superiors in the diocese as he describes the occult things he\u0027s seen, and ultimately, blindness and a mental breakdown.It is most moving when he, at the altar of the church, is praying, \"Give them strength of mind and body, that they may do Your will,\" and a high-mounted statue begins to crumble and drop dust down in the chancel area. Refusing to run, he continues the prayer at a scream, \"Oh, Lord, give them strength of mind and body, that they may do Your will!\" weeping at the seeming triumph of evil over good. After this, we are shown Father Delaney, sitting in an outdoor garden area, in a totally unresponsive state. Presubably, his mind is gone. George begins to be more sullen and angry over perceived cold in the house, and obsesses with splitting logs and keeping the fireplace stoked. One of the two boys suffers a crushed hand when a sash window falls on it, and the little girl has an imaginary friend, Jody, who seems to be of a malevolent nature. Mom, Kathy, catches a glimpse of two red, swine-like eyes, outside the daughter\u0027s 2nd story window. The family dog, Harry, a black labrador, obsesses over a secret room in the basement.George\u0027s land surveying business begins to suffer with his lack of attendance, and his partner is concerned. The business partner\u0027s wife, very sensitive to the paranormal, is at once both revulsed and intrigued by the things she feels when at the house. \"Boy are these vibes ever strong!\" she says at one point.The Lutz\u0027s witness a black, bubbling substance coming up in the toilets, an \"ooze\" coming down from nail holes in the walls, a babysitter being trapped in a closet despite its not having a locking doorknob, the disappearance of $1,500.00 cash, and Kathy\u0027s Aunt, a nun, running from the house and vomiting. Kathy observes George\u0027s persistant waking at 3:15 am, feeling he must go check on the boathouse, and other unsettling incidents. Kathy has nightmares in which she is given details about the killings of the home\u0027s prior family.Their research at the library and at the county records office suggest that the house is built atop a tribal burial ground, and that a known devil worshiper named Ketcham had once lived on the land.Finally, the paranormal events drive the family to flee the house one night, in the pouring rain, no longer even worried about their posessions.

Inside the box they discover artifacts belonging to Mater Lachrymarum (Moran Atias), the last surviving member of the Three Mothers; an ancient trio of powerful black witches. In particular, the box contains a magic cloak that, when worn by Mater Lachrymarum, increases her powers significantly.The urn is shipped to the Museum of Ancient Art in Rome, where Sarah Mandy (Asia Argento), an Italian-American studying art restoration works. Sarah is dating the curator Michael Pierce (Adam James), a single father who is away from the museum that night. With help from the assistant curator Giselle (Coralina Cataldi-Tassoni), Sarah opens the box and finds the cloak, a dagger, and three statues representing the three witches. Sending Sarah to her office to retrieve tools to help her translate the text on the artifacts, Giselle is promptly attacked by the demonic agents of Mater Lachrymarum. Sarah arrives too late to save Giselle (who is being disembowelled by the monsters) and starts to flee the museum. Unfortunately, she is pursued by Mater Lachrymarum\u0027s familiar (a baboon) and is only able to escape when a disembodied voice magically throws open a series of locked doors keeping her trapped inside the museum. Sarah tells the police what happened as she spends the night with Michael and his son. Michael visits the Cardinal who sent him the urn only to find out that, shortly after mailing the urn to him, he had a severe stroke and is now in a coma. An assistant of the priest gives Michael a piece of paper, which the Cardinal was writing on before collapsing. On it is scrawled the name \"Mater Lachrymarum\". As he leaves the hospital, a pair of witches observe Michael leaving the building.Back in Rome, chaos descends as a wave of mass suicides, murder, and violence engulfs the city. Sarah continues her own research only to be summoned by Michael to his apartment. The witches have kidnapped his young son and won\u0027t return the boy to him unless he stops his investigation. Sarah begs him to call the police (who are tailing Sarah, ever since the murder at the museum) but Michael refuses to and instead opts to visit a local priest (Udo Kier) who is a trained exorcist. This goes badly for Michael; the two witches see him and he is soon captured and murdered, along with his son, whose body is cannibalized by the rapidly-expanding coven. However, before he is killed, Michael calls Sarah and begs for her to come and help him.As Sarah makes her way through a crowded train station, Sarah is spotted by a gang of witches who, like so many other witches, have arrived in Rome from all over the world in order to pledge their loyalty to Mater Lachrymarum. Pursued by the witches and the police, the disembodied voice from before instructs Sarah on how to magically make herself invisible. She uses this to avoid the police detective, though she is forced to kill a Japanese witch (Jun Ichikawa) who catches and corners her on the train.At the priest\u0027s home, Sarah meets Marta (Valeria Cavalli), a fellow white witch and friend of Sarah\u0027s deceased mother Elisa (Daria Nicolodi). Realizing that Sarah\u0027s mother is the voice guiding her, Marta reveals details to Sarah about her parents. Her mother was a powerful white witch who dared to challenge and severely wound Mater Suspiriorum, the eldest and wisest of the Three Mothers (a reference to \u0027Suspria\u0027). In response to this, Suspiriorum (known by her alias as Elena Markos) caused the fatal car crash that killed Sarah\u0027s parents. Though Mater Suspiriorum and her sister Mater Tenebrarum are now dead, their sibling Mater Lachrymarum has emerged from the shadows to bring about the second age of magic, with the fall of Rome as her coming out party. They talk to the priest, only for him to be killed before he can give the two a copy of a book that would explain Mater Lachrymarum\u0027s backstory to them by a patient of his.Escaping back to the city, Sarah goes to her own home but finds Mater Lachrymarum\u0027s goons waiting for her. She heads to Marta\u0027s house, but once again Mater Lachrymarum\u0027s minions strike and Marta and her lesbian lover are murdered. Fleeing, Sarah spots Michael, who takes her back to his apartment. Unfortunately, Sarah soon realizes that Michael is dead and that Mater Lachrymarum is animating his body in an attempt to kill her. As she burns her lover\u0027s still-animate body, the ghost of her mother intervenes one final time to grab Michael and banish him (and possibly herself) to Hell.Out of options, Sarah locates a powerful alchemist, who Marta mentioned as her only hope to learn how to fight Mater Lachrymarum. After being briefly paralyzed by the alchemist (so that he could perform a test on her to see if she was a white witch or an evil witch), the alchemist gives Sarah the only help he has in locating Mater Lachrymarum\u0027s dwelling. Sarah is given a copy of \"The Three Mothers\" to read (a reference to the previous movie \u0027Inferno\u0027), and from this (and from following a group of witches) Sarah finds Mater Lachrymarum\u0027s lair; a now run-down and disrepaired mansion.At this point, Sarah is joined by one of the police detectives hunting (whom think she has something to do with the recent murders in Rome) her and the two go into the catacombs under the house to find Mater Lachrymarum. However, the two become separated, and the detective is tortured alongside the alchemist and his assistant, who dies after his arm is chopped off by one of Mater Lachrymarum\u0027s minions. Sarah is caught and brought before Mater Lachrymarum, who offers Sarah up to her cannibal followers but makes the mistake of removing her cloak. Sarah, having healed the detective\u0027s wounds, grabs the cloak and tosses it into a nearby fire. This causes the mansion to collapse as a pillar falls and impales Mater Lachrymarum. With the Mother\u0027s followers crushed as the caves collapses, Sarah and the detective manage to escape from the catacombs and as they reach the surface, the both laugh in horror and shock, as they realize that the threat of the Three Mothers has been defeated once and for all.","Weighted Degree":"3.0","numvotes":"10094","productioncompany":"Medusa Film","countriesoforigin":"Italy, United States","averagerating":"5.0","originaltitle":"La terza madre","size":"1","genres":"Drama,Horror,Thriller","storyline":"An ancient urn is found in a cemetery outside Rome.

Another man then kills him by smashing his head with a sledgehammer.A journalist, Carmen (Cindy Sampson), is having problems with her relationship with her boyfriend, Marcus (Aaron Ashmore) who is a photographer. Marcus says that although both of them are busy with their respective work, Carmen never seems to stop thinking about it and tends to ignore him.Carmen asks her boss to allow her to to investigate the disappearances of several tourists in the fictional Polish village of Alvania (the letter v is not part of the modern Polish alphabet). The last person to go missing was Eric Taylor (Ben Lewis), the man killed at the beginning of the film. She also mentions that the luggages of all the missing tourists end up being found all around Eastern Europe. Her boss isn\u0027t interested in another missing persons case, saying that people go missing all the time and does not give her permission to go. Instead, he would rather have her investigate why a farmer\u0027s bees go missing.Carmen and her intern Sara (Meghan Heffern) visit Eric\u0027s mother, Laura. Laura tells them that she has tried to get the help of both the Polish and the American Police. However, they are unwilling to help her. Carmen asks Laura if Eric\u0027s luggage has been returned to her. Laura says that it has and Carmen borrows Eric\u0027s journal.Later in her home while reading Eric\u0027s journal, she sees a vision of Eric who has bloody eyes and tells her \"leave me alone\". But this is revealed to be just a dream. Carmen, wanting to mend her relationship with Marcus as well as her job, urges him to come with her and Sara to Alvania. Upon reaching Alvania, they find the village people to be secretive, unfriendly and unwelcoming, just as described in the last entry in Eric\u0027s journal. Although English is taught in the villages\u0027 school, not all the villagers know how to speak it.They find a man (named Henryk) butchering a pig and a girl (named Lidia) picking flowers and approach her. They show her a picture of Eric and ask if she has seen him. The girl is hesitant to answer and before she even can, Henryk (presumably her father) calls to her and sends her off. Carmen, Sara and Marcus explore the village. They notice that the villagers treat their religious leaders like royalty. They then spot a strange dense area of fog which seems to be concentrated only in one portion of the forest, also mentioned in Eric\u0027s notes. They are threatened by Henryk and the villagers and told to leave the village when they attempt to move toward the fog.Leaving the village initially, Carmen tells Marcus that they should go back and investigate the fog. Marcus disagrees and insist that they leave. But Carmen manages to convince Marcus to return. They leave their car and walk into the forest where they eventually find the area with the fog. Marcus takes pictures of the fog. Carmen, Sara and Marcus find it strange that the fog seems to never move and is quite dense, therefore preventing Marcus from taking pictures of anything inside the fog.Sara enters the fog and disappears into it. Carmen and Marcus wait for Sara to return but after awhile, they lose their patience. Marcus insist that they leave but they can\u0027t leave Sara behind. Carmen enters the fog to find Sara. Moments after she enters the fog, Sara somehow gets out and is found by Marcus. Sara appears to be a little scared and unfocused. Carmen seems to have gotten lose in the fog and comes across a statue of a demon holding a heart. Carmen takes a picture of it. As she moves to the side of the statue in order to take another picture, the statue seems to have turned its head to face Carmen. The statue\u0027s eyes bleed and the \u0027heart\u0027 in its hand start to beat. This frightens Carmen. As she backs away from the statue, she find herself out of the fog and is found by Marcus and Sara. Sara and Carmen talk about seeing the statue, both a bit disoriented, also having heard strange whispering voices.As they make their way back to their car, they come arcoss Lidia who claims to know the whereabouts of Eric and takes them to a hidden sacrificial tomb, where they discover the bodies of people (including Eric) whom the village people have executed. Each body has a metal mask deeply embedded on its face, making it look as though the villagers are cultists and are practicing some kind of ritual black magic on the tourists who come to Alvania. Marcus, Sara and Carmen notice that Lidia is gone and finds the door to the tomb jammed.Luckily, Marcus is able to open it but they are suddenly surrounded by the villagers. They struggle to escape but one of the villagers knocks out Carmen. Henryk shoots Sara\u0027s leg with a crossbow. The villagers knock her out with chloroform but not before she sees the one of the villagers\u0027 face turn into a demon. Marcus runs into the forest and is being chased by Henryk. Henryk catches up with him. Marcus fights Henryk but the latter gains the upper hand and knocks him out with chloroform.As they wake up, they see Henryk talking to Lidia. Lidia walks off and the villagers bring them back to the entrance of the sacrificial tomb where the head of the village\u0027s church, Arkadiusz, decides to sacrifice both Sara and Carmen. Sara and Carmen are taken inside the sacrificial tomb while Marcus is led away by two villagers and is forced to dig a grave at gunpoint. After one of them leaves, Marcus uses the shovel to disarm the remaining villager with the gun and knock him unconscious. He takes the gun and runs off to rescue Sara and Carmen.At the sacrificial tomb, Cultists strip Carmen and Sara and don them with ceremonial gowns. Henryk puts on the Cultists\u0027 robes. The Cultists place Sara on the same ceremonial table where Eric was killed while Carmen is placed in a prison cell. The Cultists secure her arms, legs and head. They then deeply lacerate her arms and sever her Achilles\u0027 tendons. While this is being done to her, she sees the faces of the Cultists and Arkadiusz turn into demons. The same mask they found on the corpses is placed over Sara\u0027s head. It has two spikes inside of it which are meant to pierce Sara\u0027s eyes and embed the mask on her face. Arkadiusz takes a sledgehammer and uses it to embed the mask on Sara, executing her in the process.One of the Cultists looks at Carmen and she sees that the Cultist\u0027s face become that of a demon as well. They bring her out to be sacrificed but Marcus rescues her. He locks the Cultists in the tomb and he and Carmen make their escape.They enter a villager\u0027s house to steal the keys to a truck. Marcus sees a woman, Emilia, and her son, Dariusz, in the kitchen. The woman calls for her husband, Aleks, but is unable to do anything since Marcus still has the gun. Marcus asks them for the keys to the truck but they can\u0027t understand English. When they see Carmen, Emilia expresses fear and panic. Marcus takes the family to their living room and ties up the couple.While Marcus tries to get them to give him the keys, Carmen starts to experience voices. She sees the objects in the room shake. She sees Daruisz turn into a demon and gaze at her. She sees Emilia and Aleks untie themselves and crawl on the floor and as demons. Marcus turns around to Carmen and he too becomes a demon. But in truth, all of them are still humanEmilia and Aleks are still tied up and none of them are even looking at her.Carmen goes to another room where she continues to see and hear things. Dariusz, who understands and speaks English, leads Marcus back to the kitchen and gives him the truck keys. Not wanting to risk Dariusz going out and call for help, Marcus also ties him up. The boy begs for Marcus to let them go and warns him that Carmen is evil since she has seen the statue. However, Marcus ignores him. Carmen is then possessed by a demon while she is alone in the room and lets out a very loud shriek. The Cultists, who have gotten free and are looking for Carmen, hear the shriek and are alerted of Carmen\u0027s location.Marcus hears Carmen calling out to him. He enters the room she went inside through a door from the kitchen. As he enters the room, another door leading back to the living room closes. Marcus hears Aleks and Emilia scream in fear and pain, followed by footsteps going to the kitchen. Marcus then hears Dariusz screaming. As he looks out from the door, he sees the boy being dragged on the floor. The door then closed before he could go out and Dariusz\u0027s screaming stops. The door leading to the living room slowly opens. He goes to the living room and finds the entire family brutally killed. A possessed Carmen then jumps on him and pins him on the floor. Just as she is about to kill Marcus, she is confronted by the Cultists. She kills several of them. Arkadiusz fights back with prayers and holy water. He calls for the mask but the Cultist holding the mask is stunned in fear, giving the possessed Carmen the opportunity to impale Arkadiusz. Carmen turns her attention back to Marcus.Before Arkadiusz dies, he passes on his duties to Henryk. Henryk chants prayers while splashing Carmen with holy water. Henryk stabs Carmen. The prayers weaken her, allowing Henryk to slowly set on her on the floor. Two more Cultists help. They impale Carmen\u0027s hands and pin her to the floor, making sure she does not get back up. Henryk calls for the mask and this time, the Cultist holding the mask complies. They position the mask over Carmen\u0027s face while Henryk readies the sledgehammer. However Carmen stills struggles and the mask can\u0027t be properly placed over her eyes.Marcus now realizes what is going on and understands why it was necessary to kill Sara and Carmen. Sara and Carmen saw the statue which is why the villagers decided to kill them but not Marcus. The Cultists weren\u0027t Cultists and they weren\u0027t sacrificing anyone. They were trying to prevent demonic possessions from taking place. Knowing this, Marcus helps out Henryk and the others. He holds Carmen\u0027s head still. With the mask now in place, Henryk readies the sledgehammer to embed the mask. Carmen returns to normal and asks Marcus for help but Marcus knows it is just a trick. Henryk sends the sledgehammer down and embeds the mask on Carmen, killing her.Marcus then looks at Henryk and the remaining men, wondering what will happen to him since he knows too much. One of the villagers asks Henryk on what they will do with Marcus. In the end, Marcus is set free by the villagers. Henryk offers to have one of the village\u0027s men take him to where he needs to go. Marcus looks over to the forest where the fog is seen. Not really knowing what is really inside the fog, he asks Henryk about it. He is told that the fog and the statue are a curse left long ago to the village that cannot be undone. The devillish statue is shown once more and the screen goes black.","Weighted Degree":"4.0","numvotes":"13682","productioncompany":"Wesley Clover Media","countriesoforigin":"Canada","averagerating":"5.5","originaltitle":"The Shrine","size":"2","genres":"Horror Only","storyline":"After a young American backpacker goes missing in Europe, a group of journalists link his disappearance to a remote village in Poland.

Incensed by the skeptical clerk\u0027s dismissal of paying $9.99 for a toy from the \"funny papers,\" Billy reveals that the package actually contains the bulb for a carnivorous Venus Flytrap. The clerk doubts the actuality of the package and Billy sets off for home.\"The Raft\"Four college students, Deke, Laverne, Randy, and Rachel decide to go swimming in a desolate lake far away from civilization. As they make their way to a wooden raft in the middle of the lake, they realize that they are being terrorized by floating black blob when it grabs a hold of Rachel and consumes her.The frightened students begin to panic and mourn the loss of Rachel. Deke then contemplates quickly swimming to shore so he can bring back help as he is a fast swimmer. But before he can carry out his plan, the blob seeps through the raft\u0027s cracks and pulls Deke through the raft, killing him in the process. Randy and Laverne manage to evade the creature long enough to where it gives up trying to grab them from under the raft as well.Randy and Laverne spend the entire night on the raft, afraid to fall asleep in fear that the creature will attack them while they sleep. They do manage to fall asleep and Randy is the first to wake up in the morning, relieved to find that Laverne and himself made it through the night. With Laverne still sleeping, he begins caressing her body and fondling her breasts. She soon awakes screaming in agony as the creature has seeped through the cracks and has a hold of her face, much to Randy\u0027s horror.As the oil-like blob pulls her off the raft and begins consuming her, Randy uses the opportunity to jump off the raft and swim to shore. He ultimately makes it, barely escaping the creature and yells \"I beat you!\" However, the oil creature rises up from the water like a wave and engulfs Randy.The oil blob returns to the lake, with no evidence of the four students even visiting the lake other than their car which was left running the whole time. The camera pans out to reveal a \"No Swimming\" sign barely visible from behind some growth.Animated Interlude #2On his way back home from the post office, Billy is ambushed by a gang of neighborhood bullies, who harass him and take his package from him. The gang\u0027s leader then opens the package, finding the Venus Flytrap bulb, and throws it on the ground, crushing it with his foot. In retaliation, Billy kicks the bully in the groin and flees, with the bully and his gang in hot pursuit.\"The Hitchhiker\"An adulterous businesswoman named Annie Lansing (Lois Chiles) gets up from bed after sleeping with her extramarital lover (who is a gigolo), realizing that she has to get home before her wealthy attorney husband to avoid suspicion. Annie hops into her Mercedes-Benz and makes way for home several miles away.On the way, she accidentally kills an innocent hitchhiker (Tom Wright) as a result of her speeding down the dark road, eager to beat her husband to the house. Seeing that no one witnessed the incident, Annie takes off without much thought. Shortly after Annie takes off, the area of the incident is crowded by passersby, with many reporting the hit-and-run to the police.Miles away from the scene, Annie stops along the road and begins thinking about what she has done and the consequences involved, but she ultimately concludes that no one has anything on her and thinks everything will be fine. Before she can continue, however, the hitchhiker she killed suddenly appears outside her window and utters \"Thanks for the ride, lady.\" (A line repeated by the hitchhiker throughout the story).The frightened Annie then speeds off in terror, but everywhere she goes, the hitchhiker always reappears and becomes her tormentor throughout the trip as she repeatedly runs him over, hurls off the top of her car, slams his body into trees, etc. as he only gets more and more battered and bloody without dying. Annie eventually loses control of her car in which she drives off the road and down a hill and into a tree, knocking herself out.She awakes a short while later, not seeing the hitchhiker anywhere in sight, believing it to be a bad dream. She gets back on the road and drives home, succeeding in getting there before her husband. As she begins to step out of her car, the hitchhiker appears from under her car, completely mangled from the trip, still uttering \"Thanks for the ride, lady,\" as he was made or programed to do by the forces of Hell. The hitchhiker begins attacking her as she vainly attempts to fight him off.Later, Annie\u0027s husband finally arrives home to find his wife\u0027s dead body in her car, dead from carbon monoxide poisoning caused from the still running car, with the hitchhiker\u0027s sign lying beside her showing his targeted destination (reading: DOVER).EpilogueStill being chased by the bullies, Billy leads his pursuers into a vacant lot swarming with out of control plant growth. As he rides into what seems to be a dead end, the bullies move in to pummel him only to learn that the bulb they smashed was not the first one Billy had ordered, as a quintet of Giant Flytraps emerge from the surrounding weeds and devour the thugs one by one. The spectacle is witnessed by the Creep himself, who cackles in glee as he drives off in his delivery truck to deliver the latest issue of Creepshow to another town.","numvotes":"24946","primarytitle":"Creepshow 2","productioncompany":"New World Pictures","countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"6.0","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"Creepshow 2","storyline":"\"Creepshow 2\" is divided into three stories, conducted by a leading segment where a boy that loves the horror comic book Creepshow buys seeds of carnivorous plant and is bullied by four teenagers.

After her sister gives her her mother\u0027s car, Nell orders her sister, brother-in-law, and nephew to leave. Once she\u0027s alone she finds an ad in the local newspaper asking for volunteers to take part in a study on insomnia at an old New England mansion, which Nell decides to join. Elsewhere we find Dr. Marrow (Liam Neeson) discussing with his assistant Mary over which volunteers he should use for his study, which he explains is actually an experiment on how people react to fear. Once Nell arrives at Hill House, she argues politely with Mr. Dudley the caretaker to let her in. After minutes of arguing she finally enters through the gates of Hill House where at the door she finds Mr. Dudley\u0027s wife Mrs. Dudley. As Nell makes her way to her room, it\u0027s clear that she\u0027s instantly drawn to the house. Moments later Theo (Catherine Zeta-Jones) arrives and gives Nell with an awkward homophobic reaction. After the two get to know each other a little better, they both go downstairs and explore, and find the carousel room, then they return to the main entrance and meet Luke (Owen Wilson) Dr. Marrow, and his two assistants Mary and Todd. Once they get to dinner they discuss insomnia issues and find out more about each other, and learn what they\u0027d be doing for the next few days. After dinner, Dr. Marrow leads his guests to a room to tell everyone the story of Hill House and how Hugh Crain had built it for his wife and wished desperately for children, which all died at birth. After Dr. Marrow tells the story his assistant Mary talks about how she can feel the evil everywhere and that there\u0027s more to the story. As she goes up to examine the piano one of the strings snaps and cuts her, causing her and Todd to leave for the remainder of the movie. As everyone gets ready for bed Dr. Marrow tells Luke about how Hugh Crain\u0027s wife had killed herself, in order to scare Luke. Once upstairs Luke occupies himself with a book and a candy dispenser, while Theo tries to get closer to Nell, and Nell reluctantly asks to go to bed. As Nell and Theo are in bed, Luke decides to wander around, and is met be Dr. Marrow, who decides to talk for a while. As everything calms down for the night Nell is startled by a screaming Theo, in response to a constant mysterious banging on the walls. Nell and Theo cower as Luke rushes to see what the screaming is, although he was unaware of any banging. The next morning everyone tries to talk things out, but Dr. Marrow assures everyone the coldness and noises were all due to the old plumbing. The next night as Nell is asleep the movie encounters it\u0027s first visual samples of paranormal activity, and Nell is encountered by ghostly figures taking forms through the bed sheets and curtains. As Nell and Luke are filling out papers for Dr. Marrows research, Luke confides in Nell that Dr. Marrow must be up to something and that he would get to the bottom of things. Luke soon wanders off talking about Theo leaving Nell alone, where she experiences more paranormal events. Everyone quickly rushes in to see what was wrong and finds Nell scared, and concerned over what was happening in the house. While Dr. Marrow and Luke looked around to see what might have startled Eleanor look comes to a frightening observation that the large portrait of Hugh Crain had been vandalized with blood reading, \"Welcome Home Eleanor.\" Eleanor is appalled at the writing and demands to know who did it, but no one confesses, leaving tension between the characters. The group soon makes their way to the green room where they find a large unstable spiral staircase, and a fountain containing a large statue of Hugh Craine, and some more statues of a women surrounded by 6 children. As another night comes we find Nell sleeping, but she is soon awakened by some more sounds. As she looks around she finds a trail of bloody foot prints leading her to a hidden library. In the library she finds logs of hundreds of children that Hugh Craine must have taken in to his house, finding that many of them had actually died working for Hugh Crain. She goes to tell Theo, but Theo doesn\u0027t believe what Nell tells her, and goes back to bed.  Once Eleanor is alone she starts to brush her hair, but when she stops her hair parts on it\u0027s own, and Eleanor is deeply frightened once more. The next morning Nell finds Dr. Marrow\u0027s studies, and learns what the experiment actually is. She also finds out that he\u0027s interpreting her behavior as delusional. In the statue garden Luke talks to Theo and seems to have also figured out what Dr. Marrow was doing, but when they encounter Nell, she expresses that it\u0027s not Dr. Marrow doing everything to the house, and that it\u0027s indeed ghosts. She then insists that home is where the heart is. When Nell looks up she sees Hugh Crain\u0027s wife hanging, but no one else sees it leading everyone to think even more that Eleanor is mentally unstable and should go home. Nell rushes to the library and finds pictures of Hugh Crain\u0027s wife whispering for her to check the fire place. In the fire place Nell finds a skeleton that comes to life causing Nell to run away, following the voices of children. She tries to go through a door but is punched by a hand that formed from the door and soon disappeared. Eleanor rushes to the rest of the group and concludes that Hugh Crain took children from the town to work at the mills then never let them go. As she tells this to Theo, Luke, and Dr. Marrow, they conclude that she\u0027s going crazy from emotional distress and fear.  As Theo tries talking to Dr. Marrow about her, she finds that they\u0027re in an experiment to study reactions to fear, and becomes furious at what the experiment had done to Nell. Once Nell\u0027s in bed and Theo finishes comforting her and leaves to bring her tea, the walls form the shape of a face, and everything starts falling apart around her. She runs out and looks in the mirror to see Mrs. Crain\u0027s face, and then runs away again to the carousel room. She\u0027s then extremely frightened and runs to the green room. Theo, Luke, and Dr. Marrow go searching for Nell and finally come to the green room to find Nell climbing the spiral stair case. Dr. Marrow goes to save her, but the stairway starts to unhinge, causing Dr. Marrow to desperately and quickly bring Nell to safety. Dr. Marrow goes to the green room to examine and take notes, and is grabbed by the statue of Hugh Crain, which them starts to fountain out blood. He runs to Theo and Luke, to go check on Eleanor. Eleanor\u0027s bed cages her in metal beams, and Theo, Luke, and Dr. Marrow desperately try to get in to help. Once they get in everyone else finally observes the paranormal aspects of Hill House for the first time. As soon as they get Nell out they try to leave, but Hill House makes sure that there\u0027s no way of escaping. Nell then runs back to the house knowing that she\u0027s meant to save the children. Everyone runs in looking for her, so they can leave, and they finally find her. Even after Theo tries to compromise with letting her by letting her live with her, Nell refuses to leave until she saves the children. Luke, Theo, and Dr. Marrow still try to escape now that they can\u0027t leave the house, but can\u0027t find anyway out. Luke then falls into the fire place, and as he\u0027s trying to get out he gets decapitated by a stone lion. The house is now coming to life, and everything that can is trying to attack the current occupants.  Finally the ghost of Hugh Crain comes out for a final battle, but as his ghost is being sent to the walls Eleanor goes along with it crashing her body against the stone door. She then falls to the ground dying. As Nell dies the children\u0027s spirits are release along with her\u0027s.

The pillar is bought by the rich and spoiled J.P. Monroe (Kevin Bernhardt), owner of a popular nightclub called The Boiler Room. An ambitious young television reporter, Joey Summerskill (Terry Farrell), slowly begins to learn about Pinhead and the mysterious puzzle box. She is introduced to the pain the box can bring when she views a teenage club-goer being ripped apart by the box\u0027s chains in a hospital emergency room. She tracks the box and a young woman named Terri (Paula Marshall) to The Boiler Room, from which Terri had stolen the puzzle box.Through video tape interviews with Kirsty Cotton recovered from the Channard Institute, Joey and Terri learn about the demonic Cenobites and the power of the Lament Configuration, the only means of sending Pinhead back to Hell. Pinhead remains dormant until one night several hooked chains shoot out of the pillar and rip into one of the club goers, Brittany Virtue (Sharon Percival), Monroe had recently slept with. After killing her she is absorbed and her face appears on the pillar. Pinhead convinces Monroe to bring him club members so he can feed on their blood and be freed from the pillar.Now more dangerous than ever before, since he has been separated from his human self - a World War I British Army officer named Elliot Spencer who takes Joey on a walk round a trench filled with the corpses of what are presumably his men, explaining the nature of himself and Pinhead - and is simply the manifestation of Elliot\u0027s dark side and no longer under the control of Hell and purely out to cause chaos and destruction (in the previous movies the Cenobites were creatures of order, not chaos). Pinhead slaughters everybody in The Boiler Room, creating several new Cenobites in the process. Pinhead sets out to destroy the puzzle box so he need never return to Hell again. As time runs short, Joey must think of a plan to bring Pinhead and his newly-created Cenobites back to the realm of Pinhead\u0027s human self or else doom both herself and the mortal world to an eternity of pain and suffering.\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003dA young, rich club owner, JP Monroe, stops in an art dealer\u0027s shop. As he looks around he notices a large, plaster column with several relief sculptures on it, mostly of humans contorted in pain. Also on the column is a small sculpture of a puzzle box. The owner of the shop approaches him and sells the piece to JP, telling him to \"take pleasure in it.\"At a hospital emergency room, a young TV reporter, Joey Summerskill, is doing a piece on the abilities of the staff, however, the ER is strangely vacant that night. Suddenly, a man is wheeled inside the ER on a gurney. Sharp hooks at the ends of long, bloody chains are embedded in his flesh. As he passes Joey, the man whispers, \"Help me.\" A young woman follows after him, hysterically chattering about his condition. Joey interviews her briefly and the woman tells her that she \u0026 the man came from a club called The Boiler Room. When the doctors and nurses try to treat him, the chains are suddenly lifted by an unseen force, tearing at his flesh, and the man screams in pain. As the doctors and the young woman watch horrified, his head explodes. Before she leaves, the young lady retrieves a small puzzle box the man had been holding. She asks for the young woman\u0027s name and finds out it\u0027s Terri.Joey is ultimately bored with her job; she\u0027s only given puff pieces to report on. She also experiences nightmares about her father, who\u0027d died in the Vietnam War.She goes to the Boiler Room and asks about Terri, who turns out to be JP\u0027s former girlfriend. They tell her that she\u0027s out with JP at a restaurant. Joey finds JP there \u0026 gives him her card, asking to call if he sees Terri. JP tries to hit on her but she rebuffs him. Later, Joey wakes up from another nightmare and receives a phone call from Terri \u0026 invites Terri to her apartment. Terri shows Joey the puzzle box, which allows anyone who solves it to experience a strange realm of Hell. Terri concludes that the man who died in the ER must have stolen the puzzle box from the sculpture JP had recently bought.At the Boiler Room JP, a self-absorbed and cruel man, examines the sculpture he\u0027d bought. JP finds a hole in the column where the puzzle box had been. JP reaches into the hole and a rat bites him on the hand, drawing blood. JP\u0027s blood splatters across the column and is inexplicably absorbed into it. JP is fascinated. Later, while slyly watching the women who come to his club, he spots a lovely blond girl at the bar and has one of his employees give her a single rose, an invitation to meet with him privately. He lures the girl to his apartment, attached to the club, and has sex with her. As he does, the sculpture shows slight signs of animation. After he\u0027s finished with the woman, he harshly tells her to leave his apartment, having only wanted her for pleasure. Angry at being spurned, she begins to berate him for being such a cad when hooked chains emerge from the sculpture and snare her skin. She\u0027s forced to turn around and face the pillar. One of the faces, belonging to the Cenobite Pinhead, suddenly comes to life and hooks her forehead with another chain. Her skin is yanked from her body in a single jerk and as she screams, she\u0027s swallowed into the sculpture. JP is horrified but listens intently as Pinhead tells him he can grant JP all the pleasure, wealth and fame he seeks if he\u0027ll supply the statue with fresh blood and flesh. JP is unconvinced and shoots at Pinhead with a pistol; the shots are useless -- Pinhead spits the bullets out effortlessly. JP promises to bring what Pinhead asks for.Joey continues to be plagued by the nightmares about her father. She also continues her investigation into the young man who died in the ER and JP\u0027s club. Her efforts continue to be fruitless. She also receives news that she\u0027s been offered a job in another city -- since she and Terri had struck up a mild friendship, Terri is upset and leaves Joey\u0027s apartment after receiving a call from JP, who asks her to come back to him.At JP\u0027s apartment, JP tries to talk Terri into starting up their romance again. Terri is very reluctant but still starts to fall for JP\u0027s charms. As he talks to her, he walks her closer to the pillar, suddenly grabbing her and trying to force her even closer to it. Pinhead\u0027s face suddenly comes to life and growls and Terri retreats. When JP tries to grab her again, she hits him in the face with a set of brass knuckles. He falls on the floor unconscious. Just as Terri is about to leave the room, Pinhead stops her, demanding she give him JP\u0027s body. She pushes his limp body closer to the pillar and watches in horror as JP is hooked and yanked into the pillar. The sculpture explodes, tossing bits of flesh around and Pinhead emerges, free of his prison. Terri is too frightened to retreat.Joey has another nightmare about her father while he fights in a battle in Vietnam. This time, she\u0027s confronted by a young British man in an army uniform. He identifies himself as Captain Elliott Spencer, a World War II veteran, whom, after the war, had acquired the puzzle box in the Far East after the war and had discovered, while trying to solve it, that it was a doorway to an alternate world much like Hell, where wanderers can experience the extremes of pain and pleasure. Spencer had unlocked the doorway and had eventually become a demon of the netherworld, subjecting thousands of victims to extreme torture. He\u0027d also had several demon assistants who\u0027d themselves been victims of the puzzle box. Having been challenged previously by a young woman, Kirsty Cotton, who\u0027s own father had been a victim of her crooked uncle, Pinhead was banished and his accomplices were destroyed. Joey learns of the box\u0027s power by watching a videotaped interview with Kirsty taken from the Channard Institute, where she was held as a psychiatric patient.Spencer himself wants to regain his human form and asks Joey to help him. He wants her to, using the puzzle box, lure Pinhead into the spirit realm Spencer currently lives in so he can capture him and break his curse. Joey agrees.Back at the Boiler Room, Pinhead bursts into the club and begins to torture, mutilate and kill the club-goers. Joey sees a news report on the carnage and calls her cameraman, Doc, who tells her he\u0027ll meet her there. When Joey arrives, Pinhead has finished his rampage. Joey runs from the club, chased by Pinhead. In the streets, she sees an odd-looking man approaching her: Doc has been turned into a Cenobite with a camera embedded in his head where his right eye used to be. Escaping Doc and another Cenobite -- the DJ from JP\u0027s club, who makes use of compact discs as weapons -- she retreats into a church. A priest meets her and doesn\u0027t believe her fantastic story about \"demons.\" Pinhead suddenly bursts into the church, shattering its stained-glass windows and melting the priest\u0027s steel cross in his hand. Over the priest\u0027s loud protests, Pinhead tortures the priest, forcing him to eat entrails plucked from his chest.Joey taunts Pinhead with the box and flees the church. In a nearby construction site she meets two more Cenobites: the first is JP, who has two drilling devices thrust through his head. The other is Terri, who wields sharpened hook blades and has a cigarette jutting from her throat. They are about to torture her when Pinhead stops them, demanding Joey give up the box. The box activates and Joey is sent to Hell with the Cenobites. In the alternate dimension, Joey meets her father. He asks for the box to break the spell and reveals himself to be Pinhead in disguise. He prepares to torture and transform her into a Cenobite when Elliott Spencer appears and forcibly fuses himself with Pinhead. While Pinhead is distracted, Joey stabs him with the reconfigured box, destroying him and restoring Spencer\u0027s humanity. The box remains and Joey drops it into a foundation block of the construction site. She walks away, believing that the terror is over. The building is constructed; the lobby features an elaborate decor of the box itself.","numvotes":"30082","primarytitle":"Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth"},"color":"rgb(93,99,84)","size":2.0},{"source":"Thriller","target":"tt5466826","id":"6578","attributes":{"productioncompany":"Pantero Productions","countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"3.0","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"Lyco","storyline":"Lyco is a action horror film about a voodoo priest named Lyco Fontaine (Macquell James) who is in search for an ancient Relic that has been around for centuries called the Port of Spain elephant.

Before long, the young couple is befriended by their somehow eccentric next-door neighbours, Roman and Minnie Castevet, and, shortly after, Rosemary gets pregnant. However, little by little--as the inexperienced mother becomes systematically cut off from her circle and friends--alarming hints of a sinister and well-planned conspiracy begin to emerge, enfolding timid Rosemary in a shroud of suspicion and mental agony. In the end, why is everyone so conveniently eager to help? Furthermore, why is Guy allowing it? —Nick Riganas","startyear":"1968","runtimeminutes":"137","synopsis":"New York City, fall of 1965: Rosemary and Guy Woodhouse (Mia Farrow and John Cassavetes) are a young married couple who rent an apartment in the gothic and splendorous Bramford building in Manhattan. At first, their friend and current landlord Edward \"Hutch\" Hutchins (Maurice Evans) tries to dissuade them from doing so: the building has a rather unsavory past. It has been occupied by cannibal killers, Satanists and witches, such as the Trench Sisters, Keith Kennedy, Pearl Ames--and the sinister Adrian Marcato, who created a scandal in the late 1890s by claiming to have conjured \"The Living Devil.\"Rosemary and Guy decide to move in anyway. Guy is an actor with a fledgling career. He\u0027s done plenty of TV plays and commercials, which have made him good money; but he wants great parts. Rosemary is a gentle soul, originally from Omaha, Nebraska, where she had been raised in a Catholic home and had attended convent school.As it is, Rosemary is estranged from her family, since they don\u0027t accept her marriage to Guy, who is not only an actor, but is also of mixed Jewish/Protestant upbringing. So her life in New York is all she has: she is a young housewife dedicated entirely to making a good home for her husband, whom she adores. She has a good circle of friends, but is at core sweetly naïve and lonely.One day in the laundry room, Rosemary makes the acquaintance of Terry Gionnoffrio (Victoria Vetri), a young former drug addict who was \"rescued from the gutter\" by an elderly, eccentric couple, Roman and Minnie Castevet (Sidney Blackmer and Ruth Gordon). The Castavets\u0027s apartment had formerly been the front part of theirs, but is now separated by a partition.Her friendship with Terry is short-lived. A few days after Rosemary meets her, Terry plunges to her death from the bay window. She and Guy are walking home when they see the police surrounding Terry\u0027s corpse. The Castevets happen to be walking home, too. Presumably distraught, they strike up an acquaintance with the Woodhouses and later invite them to dinner. Rosemary becomes suspicious about their new elderly friends, particularly the way that Roman insists on speaking with Guy in private. Other things trouble her, too, such as when Guy\u0027s career gets a jump start when his main rival, Donald Baumgart, suddenly goes blind. Now all he cares about is his new play.But then suddenly, he decides he wants to become a father. Rosemary is thrilled. Evidently having studied her ovulation cycle himself, he announces the ideal \"baby night.\" That evening, Minnie drops by to give them some chocolate mousse -- or \"mouse\" as she calls it. Rosemary complains of a chalky undertaste, but Guy gets angry over her ingratitude. She eats part of it, and then furtively hides the rest in her napkin.Suddenly feeling disoriented after dinner, she passes out and has a bizarre dream. Rosemary is floating on a mattress in the sea, visits a cruise ship with the Kennedys, has her wedding band removed, is carried through the Sistine Chapel, a brief shot of the linen closet with guy saying \"easy, you got her too high\" then she\u0027s back on the cruise ship naked and told by the skipper go below the deck and passes by a burning church and lays down on a mattress. The unsettling dream becomes a nightmare when she finds herself surrounded by naked elderly people, a statue figure of a bearded man staring down at her, and two men tie her to a bed. Then Jackie Kennedy soothes her for not feeling well. Guy approaches her bed, but then something that looks and feels inhuman brutally rapes her. \"This is no dream!\" she cries. \"This is really happening!\" Pope Paul VI, then visiting NYC and having mass at Yankee Stadium, comes to offer her absolution.When she wakes up, Rosemary is sore and scratched. Guy half-heartedly apologizes for having had her while she was out. Rosemary is angry, but \"baby night\" later proves successful. Dr. C.C. Hill (Charles Grodin) -- referred to her by her girlfriend Elise Dunstan (Emmaline Henry) --   confirms it.Upon hearing the news, the Castevets persuade Rosemary to go to Dr. Abraham Sapirstein (Ralph Bellamy), a prominent obstetrician who delivers all the babies of the upper class in the city. Rosemary entrusts herself to him, accepting his odd advice and his recommendation of Minnie\u0027s strange \"vitamin drinks\" which include a rare herb, tannis root. She develops pain during her first trimester, which causes her to lose weight and look emaciated, alarming Hutch -- but not the doctor, Guy, the Castevets or their Saturday night gang of quaint old timers, including Dr. Stan Shand (Phil Leeds) and the obnoxious Laura-Louise McBurney (Patsy Kelly).As her pregnancy progresses, Rosemary feels a mounting sense of dread and angst, especially since no one close to her seems to want to acknowledge her pain. She decides to throw a party for her young friends, a qualification she insists upon. She also insists that they not invite the Castevets. Her girlfriends -- including Elise, Joan Jellico (Marianne Gordon) and Tiger Hoanigsen (Wende Wagner) -- tell her she looks awful and that her pain is far from normal. She has to see a new doctor. Rosemary tells Guy, and they fight bitterly over it, but at the last minute she relents. The pain has suddenly stopped. And she can now feel the baby kicking.Rosemary\u0027s friend Hutch drops by for a visit; Roman and Minnie spot him, and suddenly Guy arrives home unexpectedly, as if they\u0027d phoned him and urged him to rush back to the apartment. Hutch asks a lot of questions of Roman and Guy, and before he leaves the apartment, he realizes he\u0027s misplaced one of his gloves. Later, Hutch falls into a mysterious coma and dies. Rosemary receives a book from Hutch\u0027s companion, Grace Cardiff (Hanna Landy), which Hutch had intended to give to Rosemary personally. It\u0027s called \"All of Them Witches,\" a study on witchcraft through the ages, featuring a chapter on Adrian Marcato (his appearance is familiar from the \"dream\") and his son, Steven. \"The name is an anagram,\" is the final clue Hutch had left for her. Rosemary uses her Scrabble tiles to learn the horrible truth: \"Roman Castevet\" is an anagram for \"Steven Marcato.\"Now she suspects Roman, Minnie and all their all-too-helpful friends are Satan worshipers. She visits Dr. Sapirstein and tells him she\u0027ll have no more to do with them. It\u0027s just as well, Sapirstein informs her: Roman is dying and would like to go away to Europe on a farewell tour. Rosie feels guilty about her suspicions, and when the time comes, bids them a fond farewell.But not all is what it seems. As her due date -- June 28, 1966 -- nears, she learns one strange thing after the other. Could it be that Guy is involved with witches? Witches use babies for their rituals. Has he promised them the baby? She also learns that witches use the belongings of their intended victims to blind or kill them. On a hunch, she contacts Guy\u0027s former rival, Donald Baumgart, and gets him to reveal that Guy swapped neckties with him just before he went blind.Distraught, Rosemary packs a suitcase and goes to Dr. Sapirstein to tell him what she\u0027s learned. But his secretary\u0027s off-hand remark reveals something horrible -- the good doctor sometimes smells like tannis root, which she has learned is more commonly called Devil\u0027s Pepper. Dr. Sapirstein is a witch, too and must be part of the plot against her. Rosemary calls Dr. Hill from a payphone on the street and persuades him to see her. When she reveals her suspicions to him, he seems to take her seriously, and he gives her a sedative to help her sleep, but she is horrified when she awakens and find that Guy and Dr. Sapirstein have arrived to take her back home and Hill is unwilling to stop them, seemingly frightened of them. She manages lock them out of the apartment, but before she can call for help, Guy and the others appear in the apartment, having entered by some other means. Rosemary tries to fight them off and she goes into labor. They have to force her down on her bed, while Sapirstein injects her with a sedative.When she wakes, Guy tells her she has had a boy and that he\u0027s fine. Later, Sapirstein tells her that the baby is dead. The coven members sit with Rosemary, collecting her breast milk, and she thinks she can hear a baby crying through the walls of the apartment. She knows they have taken the baby, and she thinks they are planning to sacrifice it for one of their rituals.After a few days of pretending to cooperate and take her sedatives, Rosemary arms herself with a sharp butcher knife and finds the partition between her apartment and the apartment of the Castevets. Removing the closet interior, she finds the hidden doorway to the other apartment and steals inside. She looks at an oil painting of a burning church whispering \"you got her too high\", apparently having a flashback of the \"dream\". She discovers the entire coven sitting in the living room around a bassinet, including Minnie and Roman. A photo of Adrian Marcato is up above the mantle. There are other people there, too, that Rosemary does not recognize, people that seem to have come from as far away as Japan. She approaches the bassinet, which is adorned with an inverted cross, and sees the baby for the first time (not shown to the audience), horrified that the baby has strange eyes. \"He has his father\u0027s eyes,\" Roman tells her, and the coven tells her that Satan is the baby\u0027s father, not Guy. Guy finally tells her that he made an agreement with the coven to allow them to impregnate Rosemary with the spawn of the Devil in exchange for a successful acting career. Rosemary spits in his face and sinks into a chair, defeated. Minnie brings her a cup of tea. Roman speaks more gently to her and encourages her to be the baby\u0027s mother and does not need to join their evil coven. Although Rosemary hesitates at first, her maternal instincts win and she approaches the bassinet, telling the witch rocking it that she\u0027s rocking the baby too fast. The witch protests at first until Roman orders her to leave the crib. Rosemary begins to rock the baby and sings to it.","numvotes":"209195","primarytitle":"Rosemary\u0027s Baby"},"color":"rgb(92,73,83)","size":1.0},{"source":"Horror Only","target":"tt0072147","id":"6714","attributes":{"productioncompany":"Tiberia Film Internacionale","countriesoforigin":"Italy","averagerating":"4.7","titletype":"movie","notes":"Art school as context","originaltitle":"L\u0027ossessa","storyline":"The story in this horror movie revolves around a strange religious icon and the demonic sexual influence it exerts on a young art student.

He gets an assignment to protect an investment banker, and is shot by a crazed priest () in the process. From this priest Jericho gets the name Christine York (), a young woman living in New York.Jericho finds Christine and rescues her from a group of Catholic assassins. It turns out that Christine has been chosen to bear Satan\u0027s child on New Year\u0027s Eve, 1999, a date that is rapidly approaching. Jericho and Christine escape to a church where Father Kovak (Rod Steiger) knows what is going on. Christine stays with the faith-filled Christians while Jericho scoffs at their faith and leaves.Jericho is visited by Satan (), who wants the location of the girl. It turns out that Jericho had a wife and daughter, but they were murdered by gangsters to get revenge on Jericho, who was a cop. Satan mocks God and promises to bring Jericho\u0027s family back to life if Jericho helps. Jericho tells Satan to \"Go to hell,\" and throws him out of a window.Later, Satan tricks Jericho into leading him to Christine. Christine is taken by Satan and his followers, with Jericho beaten and left for dead. After waking, Jericho loads up on guns and ammo and interrupts Satan\u0027s impregnation ceremony. Jericho and Christine flee as Jericho pumps hundreds of rounds and grenades into Satan.The battle takes them to a church. Satan\u0027s assumed body has been destroyed, so he possesses Jericho. Satan (in Jericho\u0027s body) is about to rape Christine, but Jericho resists and kills himself. New Year\u0027s Eve passes, and Satan is defeated. Before dying, Jericho sees the ghost of his wife and daughter, thanking him for doing the right thing.********************************************************************************************************************In 1979, a newborn girl named Christine York is identified by Satanists including her physician, Dr. Abel, and her guardian, Mabel as the one chosen to bear Satan\u0027s son during the last hour on New Year\u0027s Eve, 1999, due to a symbol on her arm. As she is being born, a priest in the Vatican witnesses a comet arching over the moon, described as the \"Eye of God\", heralding the birth of the one chosen to be the mother of Satan\u0027s child. The priest is then sent on a mission by the Pope to find and protect the girl from Satan\u0027s presence at all costs. However, a few Vatican Knights (led by a corrupted cardinal) insist that she must be killed to prevent Satan\u0027s plans, which most of the clergy (including the Pope) opposes, as they view that taking a life in an attempt to stop evil is sinful.Twenty years later, near the end of 1999, retired cop Jericho Cane, in a constant state of depression since his wife and daughter were murdered by hit-men, works for an elite security and protection company. He and his co-worker/friend Bobby Chicago are assigned to protect a Wall Street banker. They are attacked by a priest named Thomas Aquinas, who is eventually captured and taken to a hospital. Unknown to Jericho, Aquinas somehow knew the real identity of the banker - he has been possessed by Satan and now wields great powers. Satan locates Aquinas and brutally murders him, crucifying him onto a ceiling. Jericho and Chicago see a name amongst many other things scratched into Aquinas\u0027s skin, and after some guesswork, begin searching for Christine York.Jericho and Chicago find the now-adult York in her apartment and save her from the Vatican Knights who attempt to assassinate her. That evening, Chicago waits in a van while Jericho discusses the recent happenings with Christine. Satan arrives and blows up the van, killing Chicago. As Jericho and Christine try to flee, they are apprehended by Mabel who is possessed with preternatural strength despite her late middle age and lesser size. Jericho barely manages to subdue her. Outside, Marge, Jericho\u0027s superior from his days in the police force, and another police officer, both Satanists, confront him, demanding Christine. Jericho kills them both. A few moments later Satan resurrects Marge for her usefulness as a NYPD detective to have the police search for Jericho and Christine, who have escaped to a nearby church, seeking answers from a priest, Father Kovak.Kovak soon realizes Christine and the banker\u0027s roles, and describes how at the end of every millennium, Satan will possess a man\u0027s body to consummate with the flesh of a preordained woman. If he succeeds in taking York, he will have free rein over the world. After hearing that the only way to defeat Satan is to \"have faith\", Jericho tries to persuade Christine to go into hiding with him, but she prefers to stay with Kovak after he says that Satan\u0027s greatest trick was to fool Mankind that he did not exist and she felt Kovak\u0027s explanation was true. Frustrated, Jericho returns to his apartment, and it is there that Satan meets with him and tries to tempt him with his lost family and his anger at God in order to make him reveal Christine\u0027s location. Jericho resists and manages to throw Satan out of his apartment window. Chicago soon shows up, alive and well. Despite Jericho\u0027s initial suspicion, they make a plan to retrieve Christine.At the church, where Kovak and his clergy inform the Pope of York\u0027s location, he orders them to hide and protect her at all costs. Unfortunately, the Vatican Knights arrive again, taking Kovak and his clergy into custody while they try to kill Christine again. Before they manage to do so, however, Jericho comes by and stops them, saving Christine and the clergy. Satan then appears, and Jericho runs away safely with Christine. The clergymen, in an act of bravery, confront Satan and try to send him back to Hell by using exorcism, but he resists them with impunity, killing the Vatican Knights, including the misguided cardinal. As Jericho and Christine arrive outside, Chicago then betrays the two; he leaves with Christine while Jericho is beaten by a mob of Satanists and left for dead. The next morning, Jericho is found and rescued by Kovak. Jericho immediately arms himself heavily to resume his search for Christine. He notices the resurrected Marge and follows her to Satan\u0027s hidden temple. There, he manages to rescue Christine and kill Marge for the second time. Chicago steps in to stop Jericho, revealing that Satan resurrected him in exchange for his help in capturing Christine. He manages to fight off Satan\u0027s influence after some persuasion by his friend; in retaliation, Satan burns him alive. Enraged, Jericho opens fire on Satan and escapes with Christine in the ensuing chaos.The two make their way through Satan\u0027s hideout and into a subway tunnel. They board a train and attempt to escape. Satan catches up with them and kills the motorman. In the ensuing fight, Jericho fires an M203 grenade launcher at Satan, wrecking the train and buying them enough time to escape. The banker\u0027s body is now irreparably damaged and so Satan leaves it to find a new host.Jericho and Christine escape to the streets and into another church where he prays to God. Satan smashes through the floor and confronts Jericho in his true form: a massive, demonic creature. He enters Jericho\u0027s body and possesses him. Now controlled by Satan, Jericho attempts to rape Christine, but with the help of her begging words, he is able to fight Satan\u0027s control for a few seconds. Using what may be his only opportunity to redeem himself, Jericho impales himself on the sword protruding from a fallen statue of Saint Michael The Archangel, thus disabling his body for the few remaining seconds before midnight. At the stroke of midnight beginning the year 2000, the will of God frees Jericho\u0027s body from Satan\u0027s control and sends Satan back to the depths of Hell forever. After being granted a vision of his wife and daughter smiling and waiting for him on the \"other side\" (Christine also sees them), Jericho dies contented. Christine thanks the deceased man for saving her life as New York celebrates the start of the new millennium.","numvotes":"109612","primarytitle":"End of Days"},"color":"rgb(82,77,74)","size":1.0},{"source":"Short","target":"tt0214902","id":"6776","attributes":{"productioncompany":"Star-Film","countriesoforigin":"France","averagerating":"6.4","titletype":"short","notes":"Trick film","originaltitle":"Le magicien","sex of artist":"male","storyline":"In a traditional \"magician\" attire complete with a black robe and a pointy hat, the wizard of illusion and jump cuts, Georges Méliès, says the magic words, and out of thin air, he conjures up a plain wooden box atop an ordinary table.

Inside the box they discover artifacts belonging to Mater Lachrymarum (Moran Atias), the last surviving member of the Three Mothers; an ancient trio of powerful black witches. In particular, the box contains a magic cloak that, when worn by Mater Lachrymarum, increases her powers significantly.The urn is shipped to the Museum of Ancient Art in Rome, where Sarah Mandy (Asia Argento), an Italian-American studying art restoration works. Sarah is dating the curator Michael Pierce (Adam James), a single father who is away from the museum that night. With help from the assistant curator Giselle (Coralina Cataldi-Tassoni), Sarah opens the box and finds the cloak, a dagger, and three statues representing the three witches. Sending Sarah to her office to retrieve tools to help her translate the text on the artifacts, Giselle is promptly attacked by the demonic agents of Mater Lachrymarum. Sarah arrives too late to save Giselle (who is being disembowelled by the monsters) and starts to flee the museum. Unfortunately, she is pursued by Mater Lachrymarum\u0027s familiar (a baboon) and is only able to escape when a disembodied voice magically throws open a series of locked doors keeping her trapped inside the museum. Sarah tells the police what happened as she spends the night with Michael and his son. Michael visits the Cardinal who sent him the urn only to find out that, shortly after mailing the urn to him, he had a severe stroke and is now in a coma. An assistant of the priest gives Michael a piece of paper, which the Cardinal was writing on before collapsing. On it is scrawled the name \"Mater Lachrymarum\". As he leaves the hospital, a pair of witches observe Michael leaving the building.Back in Rome, chaos descends as a wave of mass suicides, murder, and violence engulfs the city. Sarah continues her own research only to be summoned by Michael to his apartment. The witches have kidnapped his young son and won\u0027t return the boy to him unless he stops his investigation. Sarah begs him to call the police (who are tailing Sarah, ever since the murder at the museum) but Michael refuses to and instead opts to visit a local priest (Udo Kier) who is a trained exorcist. This goes badly for Michael; the two witches see him and he is soon captured and murdered, along with his son, whose body is cannibalized by the rapidly-expanding coven. However, before he is killed, Michael calls Sarah and begs for her to come and help him.As Sarah makes her way through a crowded train station, Sarah is spotted by a gang of witches who, like so many other witches, have arrived in Rome from all over the world in order to pledge their loyalty to Mater Lachrymarum. Pursued by the witches and the police, the disembodied voice from before instructs Sarah on how to magically make herself invisible. She uses this to avoid the police detective, though she is forced to kill a Japanese witch (Jun Ichikawa) who catches and corners her on the train.At the priest\u0027s home, Sarah meets Marta (Valeria Cavalli), a fellow white witch and friend of Sarah\u0027s deceased mother Elisa (Daria Nicolodi). Realizing that Sarah\u0027s mother is the voice guiding her, Marta reveals details to Sarah about her parents. Her mother was a powerful white witch who dared to challenge and severely wound Mater Suspiriorum, the eldest and wisest of the Three Mothers (a reference to \u0027Suspria\u0027). In response to this, Suspiriorum (known by her alias as Elena Markos) caused the fatal car crash that killed Sarah\u0027s parents. Though Mater Suspiriorum and her sister Mater Tenebrarum are now dead, their sibling Mater Lachrymarum has emerged from the shadows to bring about the second age of magic, with the fall of Rome as her coming out party. They talk to the priest, only for him to be killed before he can give the two a copy of a book that would explain Mater Lachrymarum\u0027s backstory to them by a patient of his.Escaping back to the city, Sarah goes to her own home but finds Mater Lachrymarum\u0027s goons waiting for her. She heads to Marta\u0027s house, but once again Mater Lachrymarum\u0027s minions strike and Marta and her lesbian lover are murdered. Fleeing, Sarah spots Michael, who takes her back to his apartment. Unfortunately, Sarah soon realizes that Michael is dead and that Mater Lachrymarum is animating his body in an attempt to kill her. As she burns her lover\u0027s still-animate body, the ghost of her mother intervenes one final time to grab Michael and banish him (and possibly herself) to Hell.Out of options, Sarah locates a powerful alchemist, who Marta mentioned as her only hope to learn how to fight Mater Lachrymarum. After being briefly paralyzed by the alchemist (so that he could perform a test on her to see if she was a white witch or an evil witch), the alchemist gives Sarah the only help he has in locating Mater Lachrymarum\u0027s dwelling. Sarah is given a copy of \"The Three Mothers\" to read (a reference to the previous movie \u0027Inferno\u0027), and from this (and from following a group of witches) Sarah finds Mater Lachrymarum\u0027s lair; a now run-down and disrepaired mansion.At this point, Sarah is joined by one of the police detectives hunting (whom think she has something to do with the recent murders in Rome) her and the two go into the catacombs under the house to find Mater Lachrymarum. However, the two become separated, and the detective is tortured alongside the alchemist and his assistant, who dies after his arm is chopped off by one of Mater Lachrymarum\u0027s minions. Sarah is caught and brought before Mater Lachrymarum, who offers Sarah up to her cannibal followers but makes the mistake of removing her cloak. Sarah, having healed the detective\u0027s wounds, grabs the cloak and tosses it into a nearby fire. This causes the mansion to collapse as a pillar falls and impales Mater Lachrymarum. With the Mother\u0027s followers crushed as the caves collapses, Sarah and the detective manage to escape from the catacombs and as they reach the surface, the both laugh in horror and shock, as they realize that the threat of the Three Mothers has been defeated once and for all.","numvotes":"10094","primarytitle":"Mother of Tears","productioncompany":"Medusa Film","countriesoforigin":"Italy, United States","averagerating":"5.0","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"La terza madre","storyline":"An ancient urn is found in a cemetery outside Rome.

When Gordon is taking his girlfriend\u0027s picture in Hong Kong, several Caucasian thugs led by a Chinese man, Kogan, threaten her, so he beats them up. Elsewhere, Bernard Wong pays his workers extra money to continue digging his land after discovering human bones. The thugs are members of the Black Ninja Clan, whose dead are buried on Wong\u0027s site. One of their operatives strangles Gordon\u0027s girlfriend, believing she knows where Gordon has hidden the Golden Ninja statue that apparently gives him power and won\u0027t say, while another hires Ghost Ninja, a beautiful witch dressed in white to kill Wong, his daughter Fanny, her husband George, and her son, Bobo, for three million dollars. Fanny is frightened by a cat in the house upon move-in, and the Black Ninja leader keeps swinging her sword to hallucinate frogs jumping to their deaths out of her refrigerator and her soup ladle turning into a flying snake (strung on a wire that is highly visible without pausing despite being a split-second shot). The witch keeps spooking Fanny and Bobo, who insists on riding his bike in the living room, but George doesn\u0027t believe either of them. Gordon (sitting in front of a poster of a strangled woman marked \"this could happen to you\" and another poster of a swimsuit model) responds to their complaints (in shot-reverse shot, as they\u0027re obviously not in the same film) and commands Magic Chan, a wizard with a magic mirror he has forgotten, and his obese sidekick, Firecracker, in the same manor, and frequently keeps in touch on the phone after his Caucasian operative living next door, Sara, is murdered by a zombie man. Sometimes he uses a black phone, but more often it is a Garfield phone (which the camera moves and music suggest is supposed to be funny). The Ghost Ninja is more interested in her own desires than killing the family, and masturbates to the couple\u0027s lovemaking before spiriting herself into Fanny\u0027s vagina (there is no full-frontal nudity) in order to lure George away from her, though she makes him physically ill, as she did to Bobo by stuffing his mouth full of handfuls of grass. The Ghost Ninja, once compelled by the Black Ninja leader, calls upon more women like dressed her, plus one impersonating Bobo\u0027s grandmother as a lure for him, and the zombie man, in an all-out assault against the family, while the two bumbling idiots (Firecracker and Magic Chan) are having a drinking contest, and Gordon, in a red ninja suit, who has been offing the Caucasian ninjas, prepares to confront Kogan, the Black Ninja leader. —Scott Andrew Hutchins \u003cscottandrewhutchins@yahoo.com\u003e","startyear":"1988","runtimeminutes":"92","sex of killer":"female","numvotes":"197","primarytitle":"Diamond Ninja Force"},"color":"rgb(82,77,74)","size":1.0},{"source":"Action","target":"tt3263000","id":"6708","attributes":{"productioncompany":"Chaiyo Productions","countriesoforigin":"Thailand","averagerating":"5.5","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"King-ka kay-a-sit","storyline":"The Magic Lizard is skating with his friends around Bangkok.

Six unruly prep school students are forced to serve Saturday detention for eight hours at Crestview Academy, where psychologist Dr. Day (Jeffrey Schmidt) conducts psychological testing on the students to examine their personalities and trigger their demeanors, recording each session in the process. Despite receiving an expulsion notice from Headmaster Nash (Judd Nelson), a new low-income student Matt Clark (Cameron Deane Stewart) plans to compensate for his poor behavior by joining the awkward Tarek Ahmed (Marc Donato), the jock Craig Cook (Roger Edwards), the sly Goth girl Veronica Harmon (Augie Duke), the prissy and asthmatic Megan McDurst (Amanda Alch), and the popular girl Tricia Wilkes (Ali Faulkner) in detention.   After giving them the task to complete a school history assignment, Dr. Day restricts their internet reach and takes away many of their phones, leaving the students imprisoned alone in the library, remodeled by the janitor, Max (Ben Browder), with Native American portraits and an Apache statue. The students believe the library is haunted. They realize they have mutually dysfunctional family lives, though they have their differences with each other, sparked from prior encounters which have been recorded on camera. They all try to break out of the library, but they are sealed in. Behaving mischievous, Veronica hides Megans inhaler and frames Tarek, leading to Megan having a shortness of breath and dying before its found.   Getting the internet to work, Veronica does her research. They discover an old, deceased Indian, Jacob Rainwater, once owned land that was stolen from the Apache tribe in the 1870s by a General, Andrew Winston Clarke, before it was taken over by the city of Crestview to build the school. As the students argue on-and-off, they find a vent to navigate to different rooms that have its doors locked on both sides. Thereby, they learn Matt has an undisclosed criminal background and become suspicious of him. After Tarek goes missing and they return to the library through the vent, they discover Tricias powerful mother is the Governor, Craigs father is the city councilman, and Megan\u0027s father co-owns the property of which Tareks father is responsible for building the library, all of who made an agreement with the school to ensure their spoiled kids would be guaranteed to graduate in exchange for the construction of the library.   A dark storm rages on outside the school, tampering with the lights and electronics inside, increasing the students fear of the paranormal. In an accident, Craig falls down the steps in the library and is mysteriously staked by one of his crutches, dying instantly. Not long after, Tricia admits her mother was the reason why Jacob lost his house, and Veronica secures evidence on Craigs camera showing that Tricia, Craig, Megan and Tarek had killed Jacob at his home to vacate the ownership of the property, leaving no next of kin to take over. Deeply believing in ghosts, they attempt to contact Jacobs spirit so that Tricia can call a truce, but the spirit rebels and seemingly harms Veronica. The spirit then appears, and she uses a nail gun to commit suicide due to fright.   Shortly after, Dr. Day emerges to reveal his alliance with Veronica. The whole time, they masterminded everyone\u0027s paranormal delusions and emotional outbursts, triggered by psychological tests (inkblots), all to sell the story and make money. Killed by Dr. Day for trying to escape through the vent, Tarek\u0027s dead body is what was used as the ghost. Before Veronica can shoot Matt using the nail gun, Dr. Day abruptly kills her with an axe for poisoning him and causing his diarrhea earlier. Matt is framed for all the murders, as an unexpected booby trap involving the statue severs Dr. Day\u0027s head, killing him. A SWAT team barges in to find Matt armed with an axe in the middle of the carnage. Matt is subdued and placed in a straitjacket. Max arrives, revealing his Apache ancestor, Jacob Rainwater, owned the house where the school now stands, which at one time was also taken by General Clark and his army over a century ago. In the closing credits, Matt is driven away in an ambulance and Tricia\u0027s Governor mother, Tareks father and Craigs father pay off Max in order to clear them of any involvement in the incident.","numvotes":"3705","primarytitle":"Bad Kids Go to Hell","productioncompany":"BKGTH Productions","countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"4.5","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"Bad Kids Go to Hell","storyline":"The Breakfast Club meets The Grudge in this sexy, dark comedy-thriller!

To pass the time in his cell, Betty had given Timmy an old, thick book called \"Tales From the Darkside\". When she reveals her plans for him, Timmy begins to stall her by reading her some of the stories.The first story is called \"Lot 249\". At a prestigious university, a nerdy student, Bellingham, is bullied by two rich students, Susan and Lee, who are quite contemptuous of him because he\u0027s a work-study student. Susan\u0027s brother, Andy, helps Bellingham one night with a new specimen that has arrived in the archeology department: an ancient mummy. Speaking about how the ancient Egyptians would draw the corpse\u0027s brains out through it\u0027s nose with a hook and stuff vegetables into it\u0027s abdomen, Bellingham finds the incision in the mummy\u0027s abdomen where his preparers had stuffed him with herbs and onions. Bellingham also finds an ancient scroll and remarks that it\u0027s fairly worthless. Andy leaves and Bellingham reads the scroll, finding a spell that will bring the mummy to life to be his servant.

Susan returns home to find Lee\u0027s brain on a table in the front hall and Lee himself partially wrapped in cloth bandages.

Suspicious of Bellingham, he goes to Bellingham\u0027s apartment and find him there with the mummy. He knocks Bellingham unconscious and ties him up. When Bellingham comes to, Andy demands that he turn over the scroll. Bellingham refuses at first and then begins to recite the incantation to bring the mummy to life and attack Andy. Andy is able to defend himself quite easily with an electric carving knife, dismembering the mummy. Bellingham finally directs Andy to a scroll, which he burns in the fireplace, along with the mummy\u0027s limbs. Bellingham ultimately leaves the university. While he rides away in a cab, he chuckles to himself. The driver asks him what he\u0027s laughing about \u0026 Bellingham tells him that a person like Andy would never know the difference between one ancient scroll and another - the scroll he reads is the actual one from the mummy. He recites from it and rides off. Later, Andy answers his door and finds Susan and Lee standing there, re-animated as mummies, ready to kill him.Back in Betty\u0027s kitchen, she tells Timmy that she knows he\u0027s trying to stall his death. Timmy convinces her to let him tell another story and she listens to him read \"Cat From Hell.\"Halston, a high-priced assassin, arrives at an old mansion, having been summoned there by an old man in a wheelchair, Drogan. Drogan tells Halston that he has an unusual mark for him to dispatch: a black cat. The cat has supposedly killed Halston\u0027s sisters, Carolyn and Amanda. Both sisters had befriended the cat, feeding it and showing it affection over Drogan\u0027s objections that it was evil. Carolyn was killed when the cat, sitting on a staircase riser, tripped over it and fell to her death. Amanda had been killed when the cat laid on her face while she was asleep.Halston is skeptical. Drogan introduces him to the cat, which sits quietly in Halston\u0027s lap for a few minutes. When Halston smirks at the ease of such a lucrative job, he tries to strangle the cat. The cat slashes him with it\u0027s claws and escapes. Drogan tells Halston that his pharmaceutical company had tested a new medication on thousands of subjects, all of them cats. He now believes the cat has been sent to take revenge on him and his family.Drogan leaves the house, bidding Halston to kill the cat by the time he comes home and also suggesting he not get angry, which will cloud his ability to kill it. Drogan checks over his weapons and tries several methods of killing the cat, all of which fail. When the cat leaps at him and scratches his neck, Halston becomes furious. At one point he tricks the cat into approaching and eating from a dish of food - he uses a laser sighting scope to target the cat, fires his pistol and misses. Fully enraged, Halston chases the cat through the house. The cat, suddenly leaping on to and knocking Halston down, then forces itself into his mouth, crawls down his esophagus and roosts in his stomach.Just before the stroke of midnight, Drogan returns and finds Halston dead on the floor. The cat crawls out of Halston\u0027s body and leaps onto Drogan\u0027s lap. Drogan has a heart attack and dies.In Betty\u0027s kitchen, Betty herself is impatient with Timmy, who persuades her to listen to one final story from the book, \"Lover\u0027s Vow\".An out-of-work artist, Preston, is being told by his agent that he can\u0027t help him if he can\u0027t overcome his creator\u0027s block.

Preston shrinks in terror, begging for his life. The gargoyle makes him promise that he\u0027ll never speak of what he saw or the creature that committed the murder. The gargoyle also slashes Preston\u0027s body as a reminder. Preston promises to keep his vow and the beast flies off.On his way home Preston meets a beautiful woman, Carola. Telling her that the neighborhood is dangerous, he takes her home with him. The two have sex together and fall in love, eventually marrying and having a boy and a girl. Preston also finds that his creativity has returned and he enjoys a successful period of production. However, he is still torn with guilt over the murder of his friend and occasionally draws pictures of the beast, which he is careful to keep from Carola and his children.By the time 10 years have passed since Preston witnessed the murder, he decides to tell Carola about the night he met her. He shows her a small sculpture of the gargoyle he\u0027d kept hidden. When Carola sees it, she lets out a mournful scream and begins to transform, saying that Preston had broken his promise - she, herself, is the gargoyle. Preston is shocked and horrified, even more so when their children begin to transform into gargoyles themselves. Carola tells him she\u0027s sorry and kills him. She gathers her children together and flies off, breaking through their skylight and settling on a high ledge of a nearby building. They turn to stone, staring mournfully down at Preston\u0027s body.Back in the witch\u0027s kitchen, Betty tells Timmy his time\u0027s up.

Kathy is tricked into going on a date with Mr. Vernon, but when she overeagerly makes her move onto him in his parked car in the woods, the students appear in their cars to taunt her. Running away from several carloads of her tormentors, Kathy runs onto a busy street where she immediately gets hit by an oncoming car and is admitted to the local hospital in a coma. Kathy\u0027s strange mother, Mary, continues to gloom around the school in her capacity as a cleaner.Some time later, a new girl named Eva Gordon (Laura Naszinski), arrives at the school where she is shown around by the stern headmistress Miss Jones, and given Kathy\u0027s old room. Eva becomes acquainted with several of the perpetrators of the stunt. It is soon revealed (to the viewers only) that Eva is Kathy. Eva has somehow been processed by the spirit of the comatose Kathy whom begins using supernatural powers of telekinesis and magic to exact revenge against all those involved in the prank that put her in a coma. The first victim is Mr. Vernon, whom asks Eva on a date. That night while waiting for Eva to show up at the gym for their secret rendezvous, the narcissist Mr. Vernon is attacked and strangled by his own reflection when it jumps out of a mirror. The following morning, the police detective on the scene (director Lucio Fulci) concludes that Mr. Vernon died of a heart attack.The following night, Virginia Williams (Kathi Wise), one of the students involved in the prank against Kathy, is attacked in her bed and suffocated to death by an onslaught of snails that appear and then dissappear. Again the police do not have any explination for the mysterious death.Meanwhile, the neurologist in charge of Kathy\u0027s case, Dr. Robert Anderson (Jared Martin), notices that Kathy\u0027s vital signs increase in step with each of the mysterious deaths at the school. But he cannot make a connection to it. The next morning, Dr. Anderson is called to the school to examine Eva when she has a violent breathing fit during a class. During that same time, Kathy\u0027s respirator temporally breaks down which leads to Eva\u0027s respiratic attack, but nobody makes any connection to it. Afterwards, the strange Eva comes on strong to Dr. Anderson, leading him to ask her on a date where afterwards she seduces him.During a field trip to a local art gallery, Grace, another one of Kathy\u0027s tormenters, returns to the gallery when it closes to search for a valuable piece of jewelry that she left behind on the day visit. A marble statue comes to life and falls down on her, crushing her to death.Dr. Anderson starts to become more apprehensive about the intense Eva. One evening, he suffers a horrible nightmare where she kills him after sex. He\u0027s relieved when Eva\u0027s mother arrives at the school to take her home for some rest. Eva begins to write obsessive love notes to him, but he brushes them off. Soon, Anderson becomes involved with another girl, named Jenny Clark (Ulli Reinthaler), the only student who shows any remorse for the prank gone wrong against Kathy.Eva runs away from home and returns to the school after dark. Eva sets her eyes on Kim (Sophie D\u0027Aulan), one of Kathy\u0027s cruelest tormenters. As Kim is preparing to meet her boyfriend Tim for a date, Eva makes Kim see horrific visions of Tim being decapitated at every turn. Kim suffers an anxiety attack and in attempting to flee from the gory visions, plummets out of a third floor window to her death. Tim arrives seconds later, looks out an open window, and sees Kim lying dead on the pavement below. Tim is decapitated for real when Eva commands the window blind to fall down on his neck. Eva quietly leaves the building, while Kathy\u0027s mother, Mary, watches from a distance.At the hospital, Jenny arrives for a late-night date with Dr. Anderson, when she gets lost in the gloomily lit building, thanks to Eva using Kathy\u0027s magic skills of mind bending. Jenny ends up in the morgue where she encounters Eva. The possessed girl, grabs a scalpel and threatens to kill Jenny for taking away her man, but Anderson arrives in time to intercept the slash of the scalpel, but gets badly slashed on his forearm. As Eva rises the scalpel to stab them both, she suddenly freezes, gasps for a few seconds, and falls to the floor dead.

Her daughter Clare (Raegan Revord) goes to ride her bicycle with her dog Max. Johanna goes into the house looking spaced. When Clare comes home, she goes into the attic to find Johanna hanging herself.Teenage Clare (now played by Joey King) wakes up from this nightmare. She gets ready to go to school. Clare rides her bike to school and sees her Uncle August (Victor Sutton), whom her father won\u0027t let her speak to for some reason. Clare is distracted and nearly gets struck by popular girl Darcie Chapman (Josephine Langford). Clare just scrapes her knee and rips her legging.When Clare gets to school, she sees her father Jonathan (Ryan Phillipe) dumpster-diving with his friend Carl (Kevin Hanchard). Embarrassed, she goes to tell him to go away. Clare then joins her friends June Acosta (Shannon Purser) and Meredith McNeil (Sydney Park) while we see that Clare has a crush on popular guy Paul Middlebrook (Mitchell Slaggart). Darcie also takes an opportunity to be a bitch and hit Clare with her drink.Back home, Clare returns to see her dad has found a large music box. Clare takes it inside and reads that the box will grant seven wishes. She scoffs it off.The next day, Clare is at school with June and Meredith when they are giggling as Darcie and her clique of mean girls walk by. Darcie questions Clare as to why she\u0027s laughing, and Clare says that she called Darcie \"ultimate smegma\", which is some kind of genital secretion in both males and females. Darcie smacks Clare, who smacks her back. Clare then gets knocked over, and she retaliates by tackling Darcie to the ground and engaging in a girl fight.When Clare goes home, she takes the music box and makes what she thinks is a hypothetical wish for Darcie to \"go rot\".The following morning, after an apparently crazy party in her home, Darcie wakes up to find part of her hands, feet, and face looking grotesquely rotted. The news spreads around the school that Darcie got necrotizing facilities from a spa, and that means Clare\u0027s wish has come true. However, the next morning, Clare goes to look for Max and finds his dead body under the deck in the house. She and Jonathan bury their dog.After spending a good part of her day pining for Paul, Clare decides to make her second wish be that Paul would fall madly in love with her. When she goes to school again, Paul approaches her and shows clear interest, even in front of his girlfriend Lola Sanchez (Daniela Barbosa).In Uncle August\u0027s home, the old man is preparing to take a bath. He fills his tub with water and steps in, only to clumsily slip and hit his head on the side of the tub. He regains consciousness, only to bang his head on the nozzle and die.Upon learning of August\u0027s death, Clare wonders to her father if August left his inheritance to anyone. Jonathan doubts he or Clare would have been mentioned. Considering that they aren\u0027t very financially stable at the moment, Clare goes to her room and tells the music box her third wish, which is that August had left her everything.Clare wakes up the next day to Jonathan telling her that August apparently left Clare his entire inheritance. Soon, the two move into a mansion and start driving flashy cars. Jonathan gives Clare his credit card so that she can treat June and Meredith to a shopping spree.Paul officially breaks up with Lola and immediately proceeds to ask Clare out. She takes some time to think about it.The Shannons\u0027 former neighbor Mrs. Deluca (Sherilyn Fenn) is in her home cooking dinner. She drops something down the garbage disposal and sticks her hand in there while precariously leaning close to the switch. Meanwhile, her pots on the stove appear to be burning. Mrs. Deluca pulls her hand out and turns off the stove. She then moves back toward the sink. Her ponytail goes down the disposal and she accidentally turns it on, causing the disposal to yank her hair and break her neck.Clare is still annoyed that her dad goes dumpster-diving for knick-knacks. She uses her fourth wish for Jonathan to be less embarrassing. Jonathan then becomes a smooth saxophone player that even Clare\u0027s friends find hot.Clare asks her friend Ryan Hui (Ki Hong Lee) for help in figuring out the phrase on the music box, as well as its history. They visit his cousin Gina (Alice Lee) in her loft. They find that the box has been passed down for decades, but they cannot translate the phrase. Gina sends the phrase to someone for an answer.That night, Gina is alone in her loft when she receives an email with the translation. She says it\u0027s messed up and it starts to freak her out. She tries to call Ryan outside but he doesn\u0027t answer the phone. The door behind her slams and causes her to drop her phone. She goes back inside as the power is out. In the darkness, she trips and falls face-first onto a the horn of a bull statue.At school, Clare is now Paul\u0027s girlfriend, but all of his friends don\u0027t care to hang out with her since Paul dumped Lola for her. Clare then wishes that she would become the most popular girl in school. She then gets invited to a party with Paul where they have a good time and go to his car to hook up, only for Clare to realize Paul is talking to other girls behind her back, as well as spying on her and taking pictures. She leaves Paul.Ryan finds Gina\u0027s phone on the ground and runs up to her loft to find her dead. He finds Clare at school and tells her that he learned the phrase on the box translates to \"When the music ends, the blood price is paid.\" He tells Clare that Gina is dead. Ryan also tells Clare that he\u0027s learned more about the box\u0027s history. Those who have used it all ended up dead. He refers to a man (Jerry O\u0027Connell) who used the box\u0027s wishes to make his life better, only for his wife and children to perish. He burned his house down with himself and the box inside, but the box survived. Clare and Ryan do what they can to destroy the box themselves (burning it, hitting it with sledgehammers, etc), but nothing works.Clare goes to Mrs. Deluca\u0027s home and enters to a horrible smell. She then finds Mrs. Deluca\u0027s dead body still lingering by the sink.Clare tells June and Meredith about the box and how she\u0027s been making wishes. Meredith chides her for not using wishes on good things instead of using them on herself. June encourages Clare to get rid of the box. Clare goes to do so, but then decides to keep the box just in case.While Clare is sleeping at night, she finds Paul has broken into her room. He asks her if it\u0027s over between them. Clare makes it obvious that it is, and he slits his wrist. He is later taken to the hospital.The girls hang out at a hotel. Clare gets a phone call from Jonathan saying he\u0027s going to a gig, and he soon gets a flat tire. The scene jumps between Jonathan changing his tire and Meredith going off by herself to play a phone app. Clare admits to June that she didn\u0027t get rid of the box. Meredith then sets foot in an elevator to rejoin her friends. Jonathan is nearly struck by two drag racers. He goes under the car to grab a missing piece, with the car jack nearly loosening itself. Finally, he knocks the spare tire loose, which gets hit by an oncoming car and nearly tears Jonathan\u0027s head off. The elevator that Meredith is on then malfunctions before dropping completely and crashing to the bottom, killing Meredith. June blames Clare for this.Clare struggles with the result of her wishes and the thought of undoing them. Eventually, the wishes are undone when Clare and Jonathan have their money taken because Uncle August never paid his taxes. They move back into their old home. Darcie returns to school with her skin healing and she\u0027s still a bitch to Clare. Clare finds out that June took the box from her room to try and get rid of it but Clare takes it back.Utterly frustrated and losing her mind, Clare tries to resist making another wish, but she makes her sixth wish be that her mother never committed suicide. Seconds later, she hears Johanna\u0027s voice. Clare embraces her mother for the first time in years. It also turns out that in this new time line, Clare has younger twin sisters. The happiness is short-lived Clare sees Jonathan outside under a tree as Carl is trying to chop off a branch with a chainsaw. Clare runs outside to warn her dad, only for Carl\u0027s ladder to wobble, causing him to accidentally swing the chainsaw down and decapitate Jonathan. Clare runs up to the attic and among her mom\u0027s paintings, she finds one of the same box, leading her to realize her mom once had the same box and it was responsible for her suicide. Clare screams at the box that she wants to use her last wish to go back to the day that her dad found the box.Clare wakes up on that fateful day. Max is on her bed. She calls Meredith to hear her voice, though she\u0027s annoyed that Clare woke her up. Clare asks Jonathan if she can join him and Carl as they go looking for things. Clare finds the box in a bin and wraps it in a sheet, taking it with her. Before going to school, she tells her dad she loves him.Clare finds Ryan and gives him the box, saying how she knows Gina and that she can figure out what the box says and that they should get rid of it. She also makes dinner plans with Ryan and kisses him in front of June and Meredith. Clare walks off happily... and then Darcie accidentally hits her with her car, sending Clare\u0027s body flying several feet and crashing onto a windshield. All the students look on in horror as Clare lays dead on the windshield of the other car.In the after credit scene, Ryan is seen finishing digging up a hole to bury the box. Then he looks around and takes out the box from the bag in which Clare handed it over to him saying never to open to see what\u0027s inside and to bury it so nobody could find it. He removes the dirt around the box and reads the Chinese letters and says, \"Seven wishes\" and looks around with a mischievous smile on his face.","numvotes":"20262","primarytitle":"Wish Upon"},"color":"rgb(92,73,83)","size":1.0},{"source":"special connection","target":"tt5204644","id":"6839","attributes":{"runtimeminutes":"7","sex of killer":"male","numvotes":"21","primarytitle":"Madre De Dios","productioncompany":"Luchagore Productions","countriesoforigin":"Canada, Mexico","averagerating":"6.3","titletype":"short","originaltitle":"Madre De Dios","sex of artist":"male","storyline":"A woman wakes up bound to an altar, helpless as she is transformed into a flesh and blood statue of Santa Muerte by two elderly Brujos whose sole purpose is to conjure the anti-Christ into our plane of existence.","startyear":"2015","role of artist":"killer"},"color":"rgb(76,84,86)","size":3.0},{"source":"icon","target":"tt0070047","id":"7181","attributes":{"productioncompany":"Warner Bros.","countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"8.1","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"The Exorcist","storyline":"A visiting actress in Washington, D.C., notices dramatic and dangerous changes in the behavior and physical make-up of her 12-year-old daughter.

Merrin has a sense of foreboding and encounters a number of strange omens, including the unearthing of a series of confusing items, a near miss with a runaway horse drawn carriage, and a clock that stops ticking in mid-stroke. Finally, Merrin discovers a statue of a bizarre demonic figure; although the film does not mention it, it is a representation of a demonic figure known as Pazuzu.Back in the United States, in Washington D.C.\u0027s upscale Georgetown neighborhood, a successful actress named Chris McNeil (Ellen Burstyn) begins experiencing strange phenomena. Chris lives with her twelve-year-old daughter Regan (Linda Blair), her personal assistant Sharon (Kitty Wynn), and two housekeepers. Regan\u0027s father is estranged for reasons unknown. There are mysterious, unexplained sounds in the attic of the house, which Chris attributes to rats. Regan slowly begins to exhibit strange behavior, undergoing behavioral changes much like depression and anxiety. She turns up in Chris\u0027s bed one night, complaining that her own bed was \"shaking\".Chris is working on a new movie in Georgetown with a director known as Burke Dennings (Jack MacGowran). While filming a scene one day, she notices a young Catholic priest watching her; his name is Damien Karras (Jason Miller). Father Karras has a background in psychology and counsels parishoners at a nearby church; Chris also notices him while walking home from the shoot one day.Karras is a thoughtful, conflicted man. He discusses his vocation with a superior and asks to be transferred because he feels he is losing his faith. He also has an elderly mother who lives alone in a slum in New York; he visits her and is reminded of how lonely her life is, and he feels guilty that she has to live in such poor surroundings.The strange occurrences in the McNeil house begin to increase. Regan reveals that she has been playing with a Ouija board and claims that she has the ability to communicate with a spiritual entity all by herself. A nearby Catholic church is desecrated, a statue of the Virgin Mary painted crudely and adorned with conical clay additions made to resemble breasts and a penis. Regan also works with clay and paint, making small animal sculptures.Meanwhile, Father Karras\u0027s mother falls ill and, due to a lack of funds, she is placed in a very shabby hospital and resigned to a ward full of mental patients. Father Karras is distraught when he visits her and she seems to blame him for her situation. Later, she passes away under these conditions, adding to his sorrow.Chris has an elaborate party at her home with a number of affluent guests. One of her guests is another Jesuit named Father Dyer (Rev. William O\u0027Malley), and Chris asks him about Karras, having noticed him and referring to him as \"intense\". She finds that Karras and Dyer are good friends. During the party, Regan appears happy and social, but she reappears after being sent to bed, dressed in her nightgown and urinates on the carpet in front of the guests while making an ominous statement to a prominent astronaut (\"You\u0027re gonna die up there\"). After the guests leave, Chris bathes Regan and puts her to bed, but is startled by a loud sound from Regan\u0027s bedroom. She rushes back down the hall and discovers Regan\u0027s bed shaking violently, rising up off the floor with Regan on it. Chris jumps on the bed and it still levitates.Chris subjects Regan to a series of medical tests to discover what the problem is. The doctors are unable to discover anything, despite putting Regan through some grueling, painful procedures. The best they can come up with is that Regan may have a lesion on her brain, but ultimately they are frustrated when nothing appears on her brain scan. At Chris\u0027s house, Regan suffers what appears to be a seizure, and two doctors visit to assist. They find her rising and falling up and down on the bed in a way that seems impossible for a human being. When they try to sedate her, she hurls them across the room with abnormal strength, speaking to them in what seems to be a male voice: \"Keep away! The sow is mine!\" Eventually they sedate her.Out of options, they advise Chris to search for a psychiatrist, but they also reluctantly discuss another possibility: they mention the phenomenon of demonic possession and the rite of exorcism. While they seem to hold professional contempt for it, they do admit that it has been known to solve problems such as what Regan is going through. Chris is skeptical, having no real religious affiliation of her own.The situation worsens when Chris is out one evening; she returns to find the house deserted except for Regan, who is alone in her bedroom and appears to be in deep sleep. The bedroom is freezing cold, the window standing wide open, and she is uncovered. Sharon returns and Chris is furious with her for leaving Regan unattended, but Sharon explains that she left Regan in the care of Burke, who was visiting the house, while she went to the pharmacy to get Regan\u0027s medication. Burke\u0027s absence is unexplained until the doorbell rings and an associate of Chris\u0027s breaks the news that Burke has just died on the steps outside Chris\u0027s house.Shortly after this, Chris is visited by a kindly detective named Kinderman (Lee J. Cobb), who seems suspicious of Burke\u0027s death. He questions Chris about the events of that evening, and Chris is nervous, hesitant to tell him about Regan\u0027s problem. While he is visiting, he notices a few small animal figures that Regan has crafted; they are similar in style to the desecration of the statue in the church. Kinderman leaves and immediately a violent disturbance comes from Regan\u0027s bedroom. Chris hears a deep male voice bellowing at Regan to \"do it\", and Regan screaming in protest. In the bedroom, Chris finds Regan plunging a crucifix violently into her vagina. When Chris tries to stop her, Regan assaults her with impossible strength, and furniture around the room starts to move on its own. As Chris watches in horror, her daughter\u0027s head turns completely around backwards, and she speaks to Chris in Burke\u0027s voice, saying to her \"Do you know what she did? Your cunting daughter??\" Chris then realizes that Regan is responsible for Burke\u0027s death.Desperate, Chris arranges to meet with Father Karras, and when she mentions the notion of exorcism, Karras is almost amused. He tells her that exorcism is nearly unheard of, and that he doesn\u0027t know anybody who has ever performed one. Chris is distraught and convinces him to meet with Regan anyway. Karras is shocked by the girl\u0027s appearance; she is tied to the headboard of her bed, her face misshapen and covered in lesions, her voice deep and gravelly. Regan announces that she\u0027s the devil, and toys with Karras in a number of ways, seeming to make a drawer next to the bed open all by itself, then speaking to Karras in a number of languages. She also conjures up the voice of a subway vagrant that Karras has encountered alone earlier. Karras remains unconvinced, and when Regan claims \"Your mother\u0027s in here with us\", Karras asks her what his mother\u0027s maiden name is. Unable to answer, Regan vomits spectacularly all over him.Chris cleans Karras\u0027s sweater and discusses Regan with him. Karras is still not convinced that Regan is possessed, especially because Regan says she\u0027s \"the devil\", and he recommends psychiatric care for her. Chris pleads with him to help her obtain an exorcism, swearing that the \"thing\" in the bed upstairs is not her daughter.While Karras thinks it over, he is approached by Kinderman, who questions him about the fact that the desecration of the church could be connected to Burke\u0027s death; what he was unable to tell Chris was that Burke\u0027s body was found with his head turned completely around backwards, and the police department considers it a homicide. Kinderman knows that Karras suspects something unusual about the McNeil house, but his confidentiality as a priest prevents him from discussing it with Kinderman.Karras visits Regan again and records their conversation, during which he sprinkles Regan with water. He tells her it is holy water and she begins to writhe in pain, seemingly going into a trance and speaking in a strange language. Later he tells Chris that it will be difficult to make a case with the Bishop for possession; the water he sprinkled on Regan was simply tap water, and was not blessed. The Bishop, and Karras himself, would consider Regan to be mentally ill and not possessed. Chris confides in Karras and tells him that Regan was the one who killed Burke Dennings. Later, Karras uses his tape recordings of Regan\u0027s seemingly incomprehensible babble to discover that she is really speaking backwards, in English. A phone call from Sharon interrupts him; she summons him to the house to see Regan, not wanting Chris to see that\u0027s happening: as they look at Regan\u0027s unconscious body, the words \"help me\" begin to materialize on her stomach, rising up in her skin like scar tissue.Karras reluctantly agrees to try and get an exorcism for Regan, although he seems to have more in common with the doctors who recommended it as a form of shock therapy. The church calls in Father Merrin to perform the exorcism, with Karras assisting. Merrin has performed exorcisms in the past, including a difficult one that \"nearly killed him\", according to the Bishop. When Merrin arrives at the McNeil house, Regan bellows his name from upstairs, as if she knows him, and she makes strange animal sounds. He warns Karras about conversing with the demon, and reminds him that the demon will mix lies with the truth to confuse and attack them.When they enter Regan\u0027s bedroom, she immediately begins with a string of obscenities. Merrin and Karras recite the ritual of exorcism and Regan manifests strange phenomena such as levitation, telekinesis, an abnormally long tongue, and strange vomiting. She constantly curses the priests and emits evil laughter and verbal abuse. Regan begins to talk to Karras in the voice of his mother, and he starts to break down. Merrin sends him away; when he returns, he finds Merrin dead on the floor, the victim of a heart attack. Regan cackles gleefully, infuriating Karras, who grabs her and shouts at the demon, \"Come into me! Take me!\" The transference works almost immediately; Karras begins to transform and Regan returns to her normal self. Before Karras can harm her, his \"normal\" personality breaks through for a split second and he commits suicide, hurling himself out Regan\u0027s window. Just as Burke did, he tumbles down the stairs outside Regan\u0027s window and lays dying in the street below. By chance, Father Dyer happens upon the scene and administers the last rites to his friend.In a brief epilogue, we see Chris and Regan as they prepare to leave the house in Georgetown. They are visited by Father Dyer. Chris speaks with him privately and tells him that Regan doesn\u0027t remember anything about the possession or the exorcism. Regan then appears and greets him cheerfully, transfixed by Father Dyer\u0027s white collar. Before they leave, she suddenly hugs Father Dyer and kisses him. As Chris pulls away in their car, she orders the driver to stop for a moment and gives Father Dyer the religious medallion that belonged to Father Karras; in their struggle, Regan had torn it from his body and it was in her bedroom all along.","numvotes":"387907","primarytitle":"The Exorcist"},"color":"rgb(93,99,84)","size":1.0},{"source":"Mystery","target":"tt0070783","id":"6722","attributes":{"notes":"Disability motif","runtimeminutes":"93","sex of killer":"male","synopsis":"In the London wax museum of Claude Dupree, known for its collection of famous figures, someone is killing the guests .

Brock\u0027s spontaneous poetry recital. Despite the poet\u0027s open disdain for his simplistic, gullible nature, Walter clings to Maxwell\u0027s words and admires his associates, especially sketch artist Carla (Barbour Morris). Unknown to the customers and Yellow Door owner Leonard De Santis, two undercover police officers, Art Lacroix and Lou Raby, take turns staking out the café for possible drug deals.After his shift ends, Walter returns to his small apartment frustrated over his inability to convince the Yellow Door patrons of his artistic potential. When his attempt at sculpting proves futile, Walter lashes out angrily at his landlady\u0027s cat and accidentally kills the animal. At first horrified, Walter then covers the cat\u0027s body with clay and the next day presents it to Leonard and Carla as a work of art.Amazed by the realistic quality of the \"sculpture,\" Leonard displays the cat in the café and that evening Walter is showered with praise by the Yellow Door regulars, including Maxwell. One customer, Naolia, is so moved by the work that she offers Walter a small vial as a gift. Lou notices the exchange and, following Walter home, asks to see the vial and discovers it contains heroin. Walter is surprised and confused when Lou reveals his identity and demands to know the name of his dealer. Frightened when Lou pulls a gun and places him under arrest, Walter lashes out with a frying pan, splitting Lou\u0027s skull. Meanwhile at the café, Leonard is closing up when he accidentally knocks over Walter\u0027s cat sculpture and to his horror, discovers fur underneath the clay.The next afternoon when Walter returns to work, Leonard makes sarcastic remarks to him about his artistic talent, but Carla and Maxwell come to his defense. Emboldened, Walter reveals he has a new work to show them, entitled \"Murdered Man,\" which stuns Leonard. On his way to telephone the authorities, however, Leonard is approached by a wealthy art collector who offers five hundred dollars for the cat sculpture. Leonard warily agrees, then later goes with Carla to Walter\u0027s apartment to see the new work, which is Lou\u0027s body covered with clay. Shocked, Leonard refuses to display the work at the Yellow Door, but when Carla and Walter express puzzlement, Leonard suggests Walter make other pieces in order to put together a show. The distressed café owner encourages Walter to move away from realism and try \"free form\" art, then pays him fifty dollars from the cat sculpture sale.Ecstatic by his newfound success, Walter ceases working at the Yellow Door, and, affecting a beatnik style, becomes one of the café\u0027s customers, where he joins Maxwell\u0027s table of artists. One afternoon soon after Walter\u0027s initial success, Alice, a part-time model who has been out of town, joins the group but is critical of Walter, whom she knows only as a busboy. Offended by Alice\u0027s put-downs, Walter departs, but later follows her home to ask her to pose for him. Alice agrees and goes to Walter\u0027s apartment, where he strangles her with a scarf, then makes another \"sculpture\" that he takes to the café the next day.Profoundly affected by Walter\u0027s abilities, Maxwell delivers a poetic homage to him that night at the Yellow Door. After a drunken, boisterous night of acclaim, Walter heads for home, but grows frightened at the notion that his fame might be short-lived. Spotting a man cutting wood at a lumber mill, Walter attacks the man and cuts his head off with a large table saw. The next day, Leonard is mortified when Walter brings in his newest work, the bust of a man, and pleads with him to stop sculpting, declaring they have enough pieces for a show. Walter agrees and Leonard sends out invitations for his exhibition.On the night of the show, Walter takes Carla aside and proposes, but Carla insists that while she admires Walter\u0027s works, she is not in love with him. Angered and hurt, Walter asks Carla if she will pose for him later and she agrees. At the show, Walter, distressed over Carla\u0027s rejection, ignores the renowned art critics admiring his work. A little later, Carla closely examines Alice\u0027s sculpture and is terrified when some melting clay reveals a real finger. Carla confronts Walter who quotes Maxwell\u0027s poetry and insists he has only immortalized worthless people. Appalled, Carla flees from the café and Walter follows. Meanwhile, Art has also examined some sculptures and, realizing they are dead bodies, pursues Walter. Maxwell and several of his friends also discover the truth behind the sculptures and run after Walter.Haunted by the voices of his victims who assure him that he will be reviled now that he has been discovered, Walter abandons chasing Carla and instead rushes home in fright. When Art, Maxwell, Carla and the others arrive at the apartment, they find that Walter has hanged himself in despair.","numvotes":"6798","primarytitle":"A Bucket of Blood","productioncompany":"Alta Vista Productions","countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"6.7","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"A Bucket of Blood","sex of artist":"male","storyline":"Walter Paisley, nerdy busboy at a Bohemian café, is jealous of the talent (and popularity) of its various artistic regulars.

Pete Thornton arrives on the scene with the police chief where, after not getting much from the distraught Tony, interrogate Marcy\u0027s mother who can only tell Pete that her daughter belonged to a book club.At a local motel, Fuad is staking out the place when he sees a drunken sailor drop his wife off at her room before taking off. Fuad knocks on the woman\u0027s front door to the room and attacks her when she opens the door. Fuad rips the woman\u0027s tongue out of her mouth as another ingredient to his \u0027blood feast\u0027. Pete continues to investigate this latest killing and also discovers that the latest murder victim also belonged to a book club too.Pete attends his weekly Egyptian studies lecture at the local university with his girlfriend, who happens to be Suzette. The lecturer tells them about the Cult of Ishtar, and describes how virginal women were sacrificed on a altar as a blood offering to the Egyptian goddess. When the lecture is over, Pete takes Suzette out for a evening drive where she becomes worried about these events and of a serial killer loose in the area. Their date is interrupted by their car radio which the announcer says that another victim has been found near death. Pete drops Suzette home and races to the hospital where the police chief is there and informs him that the maniac has struck again and hacked off the face of another woman named Janet Blake. Pete questions Janet in her hospital bed, in which the woman, with a bandaged face, tells the detectives that the man who attacked her was old with gray hair, with wild eyes, wearing a funny-looking dark suite, and he said something which sounded like \"Etar\". Janet Blake then dies, while Pete can\u0027t shake the feeling why that word sounds familiar.Fuad receives a letter from Trudy requesting a copy of the book \u0027Ancient Weird Religious Rites\u0027, of which Ramses is the author. Fuad calls Trudy\u0027s home phone number and learns that she\u0027s staying with Suzette. That afternoon, Fuad stakes out the Freemont residence and kidnaps Trudy from the grounds and takes her to his store. He whips her savagely and collects her blood, the last ingredient of his concoction for Ishtar.With Trudy missing, Mrs. Freemont insists that the party continue. Pete calls Suzette to inform her that he will be late in arriving. Meanwhile, Fuad arrives with his food that he bakes at his store. Elsewhere, Pete calls upon the college lecturer and gets more information about the Cult of Ishtar and about the book that Fuad Ramses had wrote and figures out that Fuad is the killer since all the victims were women who personally called upon him to send them copies of his book. Pete and the police race over to Ramses\u0027 store and find Trudy\u0027s mutilated body in the back of the store. Pete tries to call Suzette to warn her, but at coincidentally the same time, Fuad cuts the phone line to the Freemont house.At the Freemont party, Fuad is ready with the food, but he first asks Suzette to come into the kitchen to help him. He has Suzette lie on a counter, which he makes his altar, and say a prayer to Ishtar, as he prepares to stab her in the chest with a butcher knife as a final offering to his goddess. Because she won\u0027t take him seriously, Ramses\u0027 attempt to sacrifice her is delayed. Dorothy Freemont interrupts Fuad just as he\u0027s about to stab Suzette, and Fuad escapes just as the police arrive.Pete and the rest of the police chase Fuad through a nearby garbage dump where Fuad attempts to escape by climbing into the back of a departing garbage truck. The truck\u0027s compact blades suddenly activate and Fuad is crushed to death. The police stop the truck and see there\u0027s not much left of Fuad Ramses as Pete puts it, \"he died a fitting end, just like the garbage he was.\"","numvotes":"6606","primarytitle":"Blood Feast","productioncompany":"Friedman-Lewis Productions","countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"5.0","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"Blood Feast","storyline":"An Egyptian caterer busies himself collecting body parts from young maidens to bring Ishtar, an ancient goddess of good and evil, back to life.

Merrin has a sense of foreboding and encounters a number of strange omens, including the unearthing of a series of confusing items, a near miss with a runaway horse drawn carriage, and a clock that stops ticking in mid-stroke. Finally, Merrin discovers a statue of a bizarre demonic figure; although the film does not mention it, it is a representation of a demonic figure known as Pazuzu.Back in the United States, in Washington D.C.\u0027s upscale Georgetown neighborhood, a successful actress named Chris McNeil (Ellen Burstyn) begins experiencing strange phenomena. Chris lives with her twelve-year-old daughter Regan (Linda Blair), her personal assistant Sharon (Kitty Wynn), and two housekeepers. Regan\u0027s father is estranged for reasons unknown. There are mysterious, unexplained sounds in the attic of the house, which Chris attributes to rats. Regan slowly begins to exhibit strange behavior, undergoing behavioral changes much like depression and anxiety. She turns up in Chris\u0027s bed one night, complaining that her own bed was \"shaking\".Chris is working on a new movie in Georgetown with a director known as Burke Dennings (Jack MacGowran). While filming a scene one day, she notices a young Catholic priest watching her; his name is Damien Karras (Jason Miller). Father Karras has a background in psychology and counsels parishoners at a nearby church; Chris also notices him while walking home from the shoot one day.Karras is a thoughtful, conflicted man. He discusses his vocation with a superior and asks to be transferred because he feels he is losing his faith. He also has an elderly mother who lives alone in a slum in New York; he visits her and is reminded of how lonely her life is, and he feels guilty that she has to live in such poor surroundings.The strange occurrences in the McNeil house begin to increase. Regan reveals that she has been playing with a Ouija board and claims that she has the ability to communicate with a spiritual entity all by herself. A nearby Catholic church is desecrated, a statue of the Virgin Mary painted crudely and adorned with conical clay additions made to resemble breasts and a penis. Regan also works with clay and paint, making small animal sculptures.Meanwhile, Father Karras\u0027s mother falls ill and, due to a lack of funds, she is placed in a very shabby hospital and resigned to a ward full of mental patients. Father Karras is distraught when he visits her and she seems to blame him for her situation. Later, she passes away under these conditions, adding to his sorrow.Chris has an elaborate party at her home with a number of affluent guests. One of her guests is another Jesuit named Father Dyer (Rev. William O\u0027Malley), and Chris asks him about Karras, having noticed him and referring to him as \"intense\". She finds that Karras and Dyer are good friends. During the party, Regan appears happy and social, but she reappears after being sent to bed, dressed in her nightgown and urinates on the carpet in front of the guests while making an ominous statement to a prominent astronaut (\"You\u0027re gonna die up there\"). After the guests leave, Chris bathes Regan and puts her to bed, but is startled by a loud sound from Regan\u0027s bedroom. She rushes back down the hall and discovers Regan\u0027s bed shaking violently, rising up off the floor with Regan on it. Chris jumps on the bed and it still levitates.Chris subjects Regan to a series of medical tests to discover what the problem is. The doctors are unable to discover anything, despite putting Regan through some grueling, painful procedures. The best they can come up with is that Regan may have a lesion on her brain, but ultimately they are frustrated when nothing appears on her brain scan. At Chris\u0027s house, Regan suffers what appears to be a seizure, and two doctors visit to assist. They find her rising and falling up and down on the bed in a way that seems impossible for a human being. When they try to sedate her, she hurls them across the room with abnormal strength, speaking to them in what seems to be a male voice: \"Keep away! The sow is mine!\" Eventually they sedate her.Out of options, they advise Chris to search for a psychiatrist, but they also reluctantly discuss another possibility: they mention the phenomenon of demonic possession and the rite of exorcism. While they seem to hold professional contempt for it, they do admit that it has been known to solve problems such as what Regan is going through. Chris is skeptical, having no real religious affiliation of her own.The situation worsens when Chris is out one evening; she returns to find the house deserted except for Regan, who is alone in her bedroom and appears to be in deep sleep. The bedroom is freezing cold, the window standing wide open, and she is uncovered. Sharon returns and Chris is furious with her for leaving Regan unattended, but Sharon explains that she left Regan in the care of Burke, who was visiting the house, while she went to the pharmacy to get Regan\u0027s medication. Burke\u0027s absence is unexplained until the doorbell rings and an associate of Chris\u0027s breaks the news that Burke has just died on the steps outside Chris\u0027s house.Shortly after this, Chris is visited by a kindly detective named Kinderman (Lee J. Cobb), who seems suspicious of Burke\u0027s death. He questions Chris about the events of that evening, and Chris is nervous, hesitant to tell him about Regan\u0027s problem. While he is visiting, he notices a few small animal figures that Regan has crafted; they are similar in style to the desecration of the statue in the church. Kinderman leaves and immediately a violent disturbance comes from Regan\u0027s bedroom. Chris hears a deep male voice bellowing at Regan to \"do it\", and Regan screaming in protest. In the bedroom, Chris finds Regan plunging a crucifix violently into her vagina. When Chris tries to stop her, Regan assaults her with impossible strength, and furniture around the room starts to move on its own. As Chris watches in horror, her daughter\u0027s head turns completely around backwards, and she speaks to Chris in Burke\u0027s voice, saying to her \"Do you know what she did? Your cunting daughter??\" Chris then realizes that Regan is responsible for Burke\u0027s death.Desperate, Chris arranges to meet with Father Karras, and when she mentions the notion of exorcism, Karras is almost amused. He tells her that exorcism is nearly unheard of, and that he doesn\u0027t know anybody who has ever performed one. Chris is distraught and convinces him to meet with Regan anyway. Karras is shocked by the girl\u0027s appearance; she is tied to the headboard of her bed, her face misshapen and covered in lesions, her voice deep and gravelly. Regan announces that she\u0027s the devil, and toys with Karras in a number of ways, seeming to make a drawer next to the bed open all by itself, then speaking to Karras in a number of languages. She also conjures up the voice of a subway vagrant that Karras has encountered alone earlier. Karras remains unconvinced, and when Regan claims \"Your mother\u0027s in here with us\", Karras asks her what his mother\u0027s maiden name is. Unable to answer, Regan vomits spectacularly all over him.Chris cleans Karras\u0027s sweater and discusses Regan with him. Karras is still not convinced that Regan is possessed, especially because Regan says she\u0027s \"the devil\", and he recommends psychiatric care for her. Chris pleads with him to help her obtain an exorcism, swearing that the \"thing\" in the bed upstairs is not her daughter.While Karras thinks it over, he is approached by Kinderman, who questions him about the fact that the desecration of the church could be connected to Burke\u0027s death; what he was unable to tell Chris was that Burke\u0027s body was found with his head turned completely around backwards, and the police department considers it a homicide. Kinderman knows that Karras suspects something unusual about the McNeil house, but his confidentiality as a priest prevents him from discussing it with Kinderman.Karras visits Regan again and records their conversation, during which he sprinkles Regan with water. He tells her it is holy water and she begins to writhe in pain, seemingly going into a trance and speaking in a strange language. Later he tells Chris that it will be difficult to make a case with the Bishop for possession; the water he sprinkled on Regan was simply tap water, and was not blessed. The Bishop, and Karras himself, would consider Regan to be mentally ill and not possessed. Chris confides in Karras and tells him that Regan was the one who killed Burke Dennings. Later, Karras uses his tape recordings of Regan\u0027s seemingly incomprehensible babble to discover that she is really speaking backwards, in English. A phone call from Sharon interrupts him; she summons him to the house to see Regan, not wanting Chris to see that\u0027s happening: as they look at Regan\u0027s unconscious body, the words \"help me\" begin to materialize on her stomach, rising up in her skin like scar tissue.Karras reluctantly agrees to try and get an exorcism for Regan, although he seems to have more in common with the doctors who recommended it as a form of shock therapy. The church calls in Father Merrin to perform the exorcism, with Karras assisting. Merrin has performed exorcisms in the past, including a difficult one that \"nearly killed him\", according to the Bishop. When Merrin arrives at the McNeil house, Regan bellows his name from upstairs, as if she knows him, and she makes strange animal sounds. He warns Karras about conversing with the demon, and reminds him that the demon will mix lies with the truth to confuse and attack them.When they enter Regan\u0027s bedroom, she immediately begins with a string of obscenities. Merrin and Karras recite the ritual of exorcism and Regan manifests strange phenomena such as levitation, telekinesis, an abnormally long tongue, and strange vomiting. She constantly curses the priests and emits evil laughter and verbal abuse. Regan begins to talk to Karras in the voice of his mother, and he starts to break down. Merrin sends him away; when he returns, he finds Merrin dead on the floor, the victim of a heart attack. Regan cackles gleefully, infuriating Karras, who grabs her and shouts at the demon, \"Come into me! Take me!\" The transference works almost immediately; Karras begins to transform and Regan returns to her normal self. Before Karras can harm her, his \"normal\" personality breaks through for a split second and he commits suicide, hurling himself out Regan\u0027s window. Just as Burke did, he tumbles down the stairs outside Regan\u0027s window and lays dying in the street below. By chance, Father Dyer happens upon the scene and administers the last rites to his friend.In a brief epilogue, we see Chris and Regan as they prepare to leave the house in Georgetown. They are visited by Father Dyer. Chris speaks with him privately and tells him that Regan doesn\u0027t remember anything about the possession or the exorcism. Regan then appears and greets him cheerfully, transfixed by Father Dyer\u0027s white collar. Before they leave, she suddenly hugs Father Dyer and kisses him. As Chris pulls away in their car, she orders the driver to stop for a moment and gives Father Dyer the religious medallion that belonged to Father Karras; in their struggle, Regan had torn it from his body and it was in her bedroom all along.","numvotes":"387907","primarytitle":"The Exorcist"},"color":"rgb(93,99,84)","size":1.0},{"source":"body in art","target":"tt7584314","id":"6815","attributes":{"productioncompany":"Terra Studio","countriesoforigin":"Russia","averagerating":"6.8","titletype":"short","notes":"Cursed film trope","originaltitle":"Stalin.exe","storyline":"Young guy wanted to watch the curse file named \"stalin.exe\".

Credits follow.A man on horseback approaches a prison in the mountains along a narrow pathway. A church bell chimes the hour as a man opens the gate for the rider. He is a priest (Alex Gallier). He is escorted by the Warder (Michael Mulcaster) to see Baron Victor Frankenstein (Peter Cushing). The warder explains that the prisoner is dangerous. The Baron wishes to see the priest because he thinks he can trust the man with his story. He starts his story, \"I suppose it was when I was a boy at school. I always had a brilliant intellect. When my mother died, I inherited the Frankenstein fortune.\"The Young Baron (Melvyn Hayes) is escorting his extended family out of his house after his mother died. His uncle (Raymond Ray) leads the family delegation. Aunt Sophie (Noel Hood) and her daughter, young Elizabeth (Sally Walsh) stay behind. Aunt Sophie wants reassurance her allowance will continue uninterrupted. After confirming the money will continue, Victor quickly escorts the two relatives out the door. As they are leaving, a dapper gentleman in a brown top hat arrives. Paul Krempe (Robert Urquhart) walks into the house and presents himself to the new, but very young, Baron. He had corresponded with the Baron for a tutor. Initially he thinks there must be some mistake or a joke, but Victor explains the tutoring is for himself and he is serious. The two hit it off immediately. After two years, \"I learned all he had to teach, but we went on together probing into the unknown, investigating, recording, searching, always searching until gradually the sweep of our research began to assume a single direction and to this aim we finally turned all our energies. It took us years of unrelenting work to discover what we were seeking.\" With chemical and electrical apparatus they were able to restore life to a dead puppy. Paul sees the possibilities of their discovery. He notes, \"If we could delay or prolong the period in which the body is apparently dead while the heart is alive wed have a living body with only the barest life-spark present. That what that would mean when it came to performing major surgery!\" Paul wants to write up their findings and present it at a medical conference within a month. Victor expresses his opposition because he wants to experiment further and does not want to share the secret, not yet at least. He proposes the next step. Rather than just restore life, he wants to create life from the beginning. He tells Paul, \"We must build up our own creature, and built it up from nothing. We must create a human beinga perfect human.\" Paul disagrees, \"What you\u0027re saying is nonsense, a revolt against nature. Such a thing could only end in evil.\" Victor persuades Paul to continue the work. He proposes to obtain a body, and knows a highwayman was hanged for his crimes and suggests they retrieve it. They take a horse and cart and cut down the body and return it to their lab. Paul notes that half the head has been eaten away. Victor quickly cuts the head off, explaining it is of no use. He dumps it into a vat of acid in the storage room next door. They remove the old clothes, wrap the body in bandages and place it in a large, glass tank. Now Paul voices his objection to the whole exercise, \"I don\u0027t think we should continue with this.\" Victor tells Paul he will be leaving for a while but does not explain where or why.Justine the maid (Valerie Gaunt) carries refreshments into the living room and asks Paul if the Baron has returned. She answers the door, expecting that Victor has returned. To her disappointment it is not the Baron but a woman who tells her she was expected and needs help with her luggage. Elizabeth (Hazel Court) is the Baron\u0027s cousin and we learn later his fiancée. She mistakes Paul for the Baron. Victor arrives home in an excited state calling for Paul. He is not surprised to see Elizabeth. He and Paul rush off to the lab upstairs leaving Elizabeth annoyed and confused.Victor unwraps something from a small black bag. He proudly displays two hands, cut off at the wrist. He explains they are Bardello\u0027s hands--the hands of the world\u0027s greatest sculptor. Paul voices his objection to exposing Elizabeth to the experiment. He tells Victor, \"While you were away, I decided I could not continue with this experiment.\" He tries to convince Victor to stop, but he is unsuccessful. Victor remains in the lab and will graft the new hands on by himself. Paul goes downstairs and tries to convince Elizabeth to leave. In this he is also unsuccessful, mainly because he will not explain the nature of the experiment or the danger. She explains she is to be Victor\u0027s wife.Outside the lab, Victor and Justine embrace and kiss. Victor is just toying with the maid. She believes she will be his wife, but Victor tells her that Elizabeth is to be his wife. The next morning Victor prepares to leave on another trip. Elizabeth talks to him about the household accounts and possibly assisting in other ways. Victor pays a visit to the Municipal Charnel House and buys a pair of human eyes. Victor takes them home to examine them when Paul asks to see him. He reiterates his refusal to help Victor with his work. Victor proudly shows Paul how far he has gone on his own. Paul turns away from the tank with revulsion and exclaims, \"It\u0027s horrible!\" Victor tells Paul that once a genius brain is obtained and installed the creature will take on a benevolent face. When asked where the brain will come from, Victor replies, \"I\u0027ll get it.\"Victor and Elizabeth are in the living room entertaining a visitor. Professor Bernstein (Paul Hardtmuth) accepted an invitation from the Baron for dinner and to spend the night. The professor tells Victor that discoveries can be mishandled. Paul enters the room and is introduced to the distinguished professor. Victor escorts the old man upstairs to his room. At the top of the stairs Victor shows him a painting, maneuvering the old man closer to the bannister, which gives way. Victor pushes the old man through and down to his death. Professor Bernstein is given a burial at the Baron\u0027s expense and in his family vault. Later that evening the Baron retrieves Bernstein\u0027s brain. He carefully places the jar in his bag and prepares to leave the vault. Paul arrives, expecting to find Victor and accuses him of murder. Paul intends to stop Victor from using the brain, and tells him so. They briefly struggle over the bag and the jar is broken.Paul calls on Elizabeth in her room and again begs her to leave. He explains he only stays to ensure her safety. In the lab, Victor is picking pieces of glass out of the brain, trying to salvage it. He puts the brain into the skull and prepares to revive his newly finished creature. He starts the chemical and electrical equipment as an electrical storm brews outside. Paul is upstairs in his room preparing for bed. As the tank empties, Victor goes to Paul\u0027s room and again asks for help. He admits, \"That apparatus was constructed for dual operation. You know that. I thought I could work it myself, but I can\u0027t.\" But Paul gleefully replies, \"I\u0027m delighted.\" A lightning bolt starts the electrical components and the body in the empty tank begins to breathe. Victor promises that after the experiment is completed he will dispose of the body. Paul reluctantly agrees to help. Victor returns to the lab and hears glass breaking. He unlocks the lab door and standing there is the creature. It pulls away the bandages covering its head to reveal a scarred and hideous face (Christopher Lee). One eye is blue, the other brown, and it stares at its creator with hate. It grabs Victor and chokes him. Only Paul\u0027s quick action saves Victor. He breaks a chair over the thing\u0027s head. The creature stumbles and falls to the floor. Paul demands the creature be destroyed as Victor straps it down to a table. Victor tells Paul he will operate on the brain the next morning and try to correct its homicidal tendencies. But the next morning the lab is a shambles and the window broken. The creature has broken free and escaped.Victor and Paul search the countryside for the creature. An old blind man (Fred Johnson) and his grandson (Claude Kingston) are out in the woods for a stroll. The old man sits and the grandson goes down to the lake shore to pick mushrooms. The creature encounters the old man. After a brief exchange he kills the old man. The grandson returns to where he left his grandfather. Victor and Paul find signs and follow it into the woods. They find it, and Paul shoots the creature through the eye. The creature falls and is pronounced dead. They bury it in place and return to the house.Paul goes to the lab and tells Victor he is leaving. With the creature dead, he no longer needs to stay and protect Elizabeth. But Paul doesn\u0027t know Victor dug his creation up and returned its lifeless body back to the lab. Victor stares at his creature hanging in the store room and promises, \"I\u0027ll give you life again.\" Victor is dressed and tells Justine she can serve dinner. Justine reminds Victor of his promise to marry her. Her trump card is the revelation she is pregnant with his child. He does not believe he is the father, but Justine informs the master that Elizabeth will believe her. She adds that she will go to the authorities regarding the experiment. He fires the maid and orders that she leave the next morning. That night Justine goes up to the lab to get the proof she will need for the authorities. Victor leaves the lab door unlocked and Justine enters for a look. She enters the storage room and finds the revived creature. When she tries to flee, Victor locks her in, knowing his homicidal creation will kill her. It does.A week later, Victor and Elizabeth are having breakfast. Elizabeth inquires about Justine. Victor lies and tells her, \"I expect some village lothario eloped with her.\" They discuss the wedding plans. Elizabeth reveals she invited Paul. Instead of being angry, Victor casually informs her he hopes Paul comes. He says that he has something to show Paul.It is the eve of the wedding, and a reception at the Baron\u0027s home is underway. The Burgomaster (Andrew Leigh) is enjoying the laced punch and practicing his speech. His wife (Ann Blake) reproaches her drunk husband and they leave for home. When all the guests have left, Victor announces he will be working in the lab. Elizabeth is disappointed and tells her future husband. Paul does not attend the reception, but does come later that evening. Elizabeth tells Paul to go surprise Victor. Victor is preparing a plate of flood when Paul knocks on the lab door. Victor invites his old tutor into the lab. He leads him to the storage room. Paul is shocked to discover the creature chained to the wall and showing signs of brain surgery. Victor orders the creature onto its feet. It struggles but stands, then sits when ordered. Paul chides the Baron about the creature\u0027s lack of perfection, but Victor reminds Paul, \"There you see the result of your handiwork as much as mine...but you damaged it. You put a bullet in the wretched thing. This is your fault, Paul.\" Paul exits the lab, promising to go to the authorities and have them destroy the creature. Victor chases after him. He leaves the lab door unlocked and Elizabeth enters the lab. The creature breaks its chains. Elizabeth enters the storage room and sees the vat of acid. The creature gets out onto the roof. Victor and Paul see it and Paul goes to the village for help. Elizabeth goes outside to explore a noise she heard. Victor grabs a pistol and goes out to the roof. Firing at the creature he hits Elizabeth, then the creature. Only wounded, the creature approaches Victor. A well-aimed toss of an oil lamp sets the creature ablaze. The creature falls through the skylight and straight into the acid filled vat below.We return to the prison, and the priest still listening to the story now finished. Victor concludes, \"My life\u0027s work destroyed. Destroyed in a moment. And by the same hand that gave it life.\" Paul comes to visit Victor at the prison. Elizabeth was only wounded and recovers. She is also at the prison, but stays in the waiting area. Victor begs Paul to tell the priest about the creature and to verify the story, but Paul denies it. He does accuse Victor of murdering Justine. Victor claims it was the creature who murdered the maid. The priest leaves the cell. Victor tries to kill Paul, but the jailer prevents it. Paul leaves the cell and returns to talk to Elizabeth. He takes her home. Victor is led to his execution. The last scene is of a guillotine, seen in silhouette, and the credits roll.","numvotes":"10925","primarytitle":"The Curse of Frankenstein","productioncompany":"Hammer Films","countriesoforigin":"United Kingdom","averagerating":"7.1","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"The Curse of Frankenstein","sex of artist":"male","storyline":"In prison and awaiting execution, Dr. Victor Frankenstein recounts to a priest what led him to his current circumstance.

She is being questioned by a doctor who shows her pictures of her family and asks if she can speak about the day that led her to being admitted to the hospital.The next scene shows her returning with her father and sister, Su-Yeon, to the family\u0027s secluded estate near a lake. The two sisters are reluctant to go inside the house where their stepmother awaits. Instead they go down to a pier by the lake where they relax by putting their feet in the water and enjoy the sunshine.Soon, they are called back to the house where they are greeted by the stepmother with a forced welcome. She chastises them for making her wait and taunts them by asking if they are feeling better after having been away. The two sisters are unresponsive and quickly leave to other parts of the house.At a tense family dinner, the stepmother announces she has invited the sister\u0027s uncle and his wife to dinner the next day. Su-Mi tells her stepmother she will not eat with them and the two sisters leave the table. Su-Mi tells Su-Yeon that if their stepmother ever goes after Su-Yeon to let her know.That night as Su-Yeon goes to sleep, she hears noises and the door to her bedroom creakily opens and a female hand sneaks around it. Su-Yeon pulls the covers over her head only to have them pulled back by an unseen force. Terrified, she runs out of her room to Su-Mi and tells her that someone has come into her room.When Su-Mi goes to investigate, she only finds her father sleeping, but her stepmom catches her and tells her not to wake him. She rejoins Su-Yeon and comforts her, telling her that she will always be with her and they fall asleep.Later, Su-Mi has a nightmarish dream about blood and a hand desperately slapping at the floor. She wakens to see something moving in her room. Crawling along the floor is the apparition of a woman whose face is covered by long black hair. The wraith becomes aware that Su-Mi is looking at her and she none too slowly floats over the top of her. The ghost is hanging in mid-air with blood running down her leg. A hand suddenly appears from under her dress. Su-Mi awakes with a start realizing everything she has witnessed was still a dream.Tension continues to rise among the three females as their menstrual cycles become synched together.Su-Mi finds several family photos which reveal that their stepmother was once a nurse her father worked with and apparently was also a live-in nurse for the girl\u0027s mother. Su-Yeon enters the room and Su-Mi discovers bruises on her arm, but when she angrily questions her if their stepmother was the cause, Su-Yeon refuses to answer and runs out. Su-Mi confronts her stepmother about Su-Yeons injuries. The stepmother angrily responds to Su-Mi by telling her that she is now the sister\u0027s mother and that they must accept it and bear the worst that life has to offer. She also questions if Su-Mi is feeling well.That night, the sister\u0027s uncle and his wife arrive for a visit. They dine with the father and stepmother, whose behavior is extremely exaggerated and odd. When she asks the uncle if he remembers a peculiar event he tells her he doesn\u0027t. She responds icily: \"Why don\u0027t you remember? Are you crazy?\"Suddenly, the uncle\u0027s wife starts to convulse. She is thrown to the floor and has a violent attack. When she recovers the uncle drives her home and she informs him that during her attack she saw a girl under the kitchen sink. The stepmother sees the girl too and tells the sister\u0027s father that ever since Su-Mi and Su-Yeon returned home weird things have been happening inside the house. The father seems unconvinced.The stepmother goes into Su-Yeon\u0027s room where she discovers that photos of her have been mutilated and her face has been scratched out. Enraged, she attacks Su-Yeon and throws her into a wardrobe closet and locks her inside and refuses to let the terrified girl out. When the stepmother leaves the room, Su-Mi suspecting something is wrong, enters the bedroom and releases her sister from the closet. Overcome, she comforts Su-Yeon and tells her that she is sorry, that she didnt\u0027 hear Su-Yeon\u0027s pleas for help and that this will never happen again.The father enters and asks Su-Mi why all these bad things have been happening since she returned. Su-Mi says that it\u0027s the stepmother to blame and that his new wife has been attacking Su-Yeon. The father tells her to stop it and screams at her that Su-Yeon is dead. Neither Su-Mi, nor Su-Yeon, is pleased to hear this news.The father makes a phone call and informs the other person that he/she must come to the house tomorrow. The next morning, the stepmother is shown dragging a large sack with something inside it into the house and she starts beating it with a stick. The noise awakens Su-Mi. When she gets up she finds a note from her father saying he will return to the house that afternoon.Su-Mi runs to find Su-Yeon and sees a trail of blood on the floor. Following it leads to the sack the stepmother dragged in earlier. Su-Mi thinks it is Su-Yeon inside, but she can\u0027t get the bag open. She goes to the kitchen to retrieve a knife and when she returns she finds that the sack has been moved to the wardrobe closet. She also finds that her stepmother is behind her ready to throw boiling water on her. A violent fight ensues between the two females and Su-Mi stumbles and is knocked unconscious. Her stepmother drags her to another part of the house and retrieves a garden statue.As Su-Mi regains consciousness, the stepmother asks her what brought them to this point and reminds Su-Mi of a conversation the two once had where the stepmother told her that one day Su-Mi would live to regret something and that no matter how hard Su-Mi would try to forget it, she would never be able to. The stepmother then proceeds to drop the statue on Su-Mi\u0027s head as the father returns.He finds an unconscious Su-Mi as well as the injured stepmother. He attends to the stepmother\u0027s injuries and leaves the room. When the door opens again, someone else enters: the real stepmother. How can this new person be the stepmother when the original stepmother is sitting right there looking at herself?The camera turns 360 degrees to reveal that Su-Mi has been in the house alone with her father the past few days and that the conversations and events she had previously had with Su-Yeon and her stepmother were the result of her schizophrenic mind.The father and real stepmother take Su-Mi back to the hospital and the stepmother returns to the house alone that evening. There she hears an odd noise upstairs in what was once Su-Yeon\u0027s bedroom. When she goes to investigate she encounters a ghost hiding in the wardrobe closet.Flashback scenes reveal that one day some time ago, the father visited the house with the stepmother after what was an apparent marriage, or engagement, to his mistress. His ex-wife, the uncle and the uncle\u0027s wife are also there. An argument results and the sister\u0027s real mother goes into Su-Yeon\u0027s room. When her daughter goes to sleep the mother hangs herself in Su-Yeon\u0027s wardrobe closet. The apparition Su-Mi dreamed of earlier was her hanged mother.In the reveal, Su-Yeon wakens and the door to her closet opens. When she looks inside she finds her mother hanged. She shakes the lifeless body in an attempt to revive it, but instead pulls the wardrobe closet down on top of her. There she suffocates, or is slowly crushed to death, by the weight of her mother and the closet. She desperately strikes at the floor with her hand and calls out for Su-Mi to help her.We also learn that the stepmother having heard something upstairs goes into Su-Yeon\u0027s room. There she discovers the turned over wardrobe, but apparently thinks it is the father\u0027s wife under the closet. She does nothing to help her and quickly leaves the room. She encounters Su-Mi and the two exchange words. The stepmother tells Su-Mi that Su-Mi will one day regret something and that she will not be able to make it go away. Su-Mi brushes past her and leaves the house. She hesitates and thinks about going back inside, but instead she goes for a walk down a pathway not knowing that her life has changed forever and that she won\u0027t be able to ever make the past events go away.","numvotes":"60965","primarytitle":"A Tale of Two Sisters"},"color":"rgb(92,73,83)","size":1.0},{"source":"body in art","target":"tt0054240","id":"7207","attributes":{"productioncompany":"Astra Productions","countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"2.9","titletype":"movie","notes":"Orientalism; other arts more important","originaltitle":"Orgy of the Dead","storyline":"Bob and his girlfriend Shirley go in search of a cemetery in order to inspire John for writing his next horror story.

They open the doors, revealing a coffin. They remove the lid and exit the crypt, then the inhabitant of the coffin (Criswell) sits up to deliver an opening narration.The opening credits feature the image of \"an immobile young woman clad in gold\". The image was probably inspired by a memorable scene of Goldfinger (1964).Following the credits, the camera shifts to a lone Chevrolet Corvair driving down a California desert road. Its passengers Bob (William Bates) and Shirley (Pat Barrington) are arguing over the decision to use this night to search for a cemetery. Bob is a horror writer who hopes that the scene of a cemetery at night will bring him inspiration. The conversation ends when Bob accidentally drives the car off the road and over a cliff. The next scene opens to a nocturnal image of a fog-shrouded cemetery. The lonely figure of the Emperor (Criswell) walks towards a marble altar, sits, and then summons his \"Princess of the Night\", the Black Ghoul (Fawn Silver), who appears and bows before him. The Emperor warns that if the night\u0027s entertainment fails to please him, he will banish the souls of the entertainers to eternal damnation, indicating that he is an all-powerful demonic being.As the full moon appears, the Black Ghoul summons the first dancer of the night, a Native American woman (Bunny Glaser). The Black Ghoul explains that this woman loved flames, and that both she and her lovers died in flames. The woman dances and strips before the flames of the cemetery. The Black Ghoul then introduces the second dancer of the night, a street walker in life. While the woman dances, Bob and Shirley make their way to the cemetery and start observing the dance from a distance. Shirley suspects that they are observing a college initiation, though Bob seriously doubts her theory.The Emperor himself summons the third dancer, a woman who worshiped gold above else. The Golden Girl (Pat Barrington) dances in her turn, and the Emperor instructs his loin-clothed servants to reward her with gold. The supposed reward is soon revealed to be a punishment, as the servants place her in a cauldron with liquid gold. What emerges from the cauldron is a golden statue of the living woman who entered. The servants transport the immobile statue to a nearby crypt.At this point, a werewolf (John Andrews) and mummy (Louis Ojena) appear and seize the intruding young couple. They are brought before the Emperor who decides to postpone deciding their fate. The intruders are tied up, side by side, and allowed to continue watching the dances. The Black Ghoul next introduces the fourth dancer, a \"Cat Woman\" (Texas Starr). She is depicted as a woman dressed in a leopard costume, which exposes her chest area. As she dances, a servant follows her around and thrashes her with a bullwhip. Offering a sadomasochistic show for the spectators.The Emperor next calls for a Slave Girl (Nadejda Dobrev) to be whipped for his amusement. The slave wears a tunic and is chained to a wall. Following her torture session, the Slave Girl breaks free and becomes the fifth dancer of the night. Later, the Black Ghoul exhibits a fascination with Shirley and scratches a mark on her. She draws a knife and seems about to kill Shirley, when the Emperor decides it is not yet time for the intruders to properly join them. The female ghoul reluctantly obeys.The Emperor is puzzled when a human skull appears instead of the next dancer. The Black Ghoul explains it is the symbol of the sixth dancer, who loved bullfighting and matadors. She used to dance over their demise, and now it\u0027s time to dance over her own. The dancer of apparent Spanish/Mexican heritage (Stephanie Jones) appears to perform. The Emperor and Ghoul briefly discuss the past of the dancer, who came to them on the Day of the Dead.The seventh dancer appears dressed in Polynesian garments. The Black Ghoul describes her as a worshiper of snakes, smoke, and flames. A rattlesnake is depicted along with her dance. The camera shifts to the mummy and the werewolf. The mummy voices his dislike of snakes and recalls the death of Cleopatra. He informs his companion that ancient Egypt had many snakes and they were the stuff of nightmares.   The Emperor next expresses his boredom and demands \"unusual\" entertainment, while the Black Ghoul notes that the night is almost over. She reminds her superior that they will be gone at the first sight of the morning sun. They proceed to argue over the fate of Shirley.The argument ends with the introduction of the eighth dancer (Barbara Nordin), a woman who murdered her husband on their wedding night. She dances with the skeleton of her spouse. The argument over Shirley then resumes, as the Ghoul claims her for her own. The Emperor feels the need to assert his own authority over the Black Ghoul.The ninth dancer (Dene Starnes) was a zombie in life and remains zombie-like in death. The tenth and final dancer (Rene De Beau) is introduced as one who died for feathers, fur, and fluff. She starts her dance in clothing matching this style. When the final dance ends, the Emperor finally offers Shirley to the Ghoul. The Ghoul briefly dances herself as she prepares to claim her prize. But dawn arrives and with it sunlight. The Emperor and all his undead are reduced to bones.The final scene has Bob and Shirley waking up at the scene of the accident, surrounded by paramedics, suggesting it was all a dream.

Carol, their very young daughter, is in bed right in the next room, but she is awake. Heartbroken, Lucy suffers a moment of fury and confusion that leads her to spontaneously pick up a nearby axe and decapitate her husband and his lover while they sleep. Carol watches in terror and shock as Lucy hacks the two bodies to pieces. Lucy is declared insane and sent to an asylum, where she endures traumatic shock treatments for her mental breakdown.The narrator of the flashback is revealed to be Carol, now a young woman. It is twenty years later, and Carol is opening up about her past to her boyfriend, Michael Fields. After Lucy\u0027s incarceration, Carol was taken in by her aunt and uncle, Bill and Emily, and the family lives on a farm in a rural location. Carol is revealing the family history to Michael because Lucy is being released from the asylum, and is coming to live with the family. When Lucy arrives, she is skittish. She cautiously acclimates to the farm, exploring the area with Carol and meeting the gritty-looking farm hand, Krause. But she is clearly thrilled to see Carol again, and is touched by the lovely young woman Carol has become. Carol is a sculptress and has a spacious studio filled with her work, and she thrills Lucy by giving her a bust of herself just as she was in her youth.Things quickly start to get strange. Carol shocks Lucy by presenting her with two bracelets she used to wear when she was a young woman, large dangling charm bracelets that jangle when she walks. Carol seems intent on recreating Lucy as a young woman, taking her clothes shopping and buying her a wig that mimics the hairstyle she wore the last time Carol saw her. Lucy is uncomfortable with this, but agrees to dress this way to please her daughter, whom she desperately wants to make amends with. While they are in the wig shop, Lucy hears strange voices, as if children are singing a morbid nursery rhyme about her crimes. She dismisses it as nerves. Later, she suffers a terrible nightmare and wakes up to discover two bloody heads in bed with her, with a bloody axe lying nearby. When she wakes the others, the items are gone from her room. Lucy starts to think she is relapsing.Things get worse when Carol attempts to introduce Michael to her mother. When Michael stops by for drinks, Lucy seems to try and seduce him, all with Carol right there in the room. The embarassing scene is interrupted by Lucy\u0027s former psychiatrist, Dr. Anderson, who makes an unexpected visit. When he sees how unstable Lucy seems, Dr. Anderson makes comments to the family that suggest he would like to take Lucy back to the hospital. When the doctor gets Lucy alone, his comments upset her and she runs off. As Dr. Anderson searches for her around the farm, he enters the darkened barn and a shadowy figure corners him--it appears to be Lucy, the silhouette revealing her hairstyle and figure, right down to the jangling bracelets she wears. The figure is holding an axe, and quickly decapitates Dr. Anderson.Carol returns to the farmhouse to find her mother alone in the darkened living room. The doctor\u0027s car is still outside, and Carol quickly comes to the conclusion that her mother has killed him. In a panic, Carol drives the doctor\u0027s car into a barn and locks it in, but she is spotted by Krause, who is lurking the shadows. The next day, Carol sees Krause painting the car a different color and angrily confronts him, but he smugly suggests that he knows what happened to the doctor, and that he\u0027ll turn Lucy in to the authorities if Carol fires him. Lucy overhears the conversation from the window. Later that evening, Krause is stalked and murdered with the axe.Lucy prepares for an evening that she dreads, a dinner party intended to introduce her to Michael\u0027s parents. If Michael and Carol are to be married, these will be their in-laws, and Michael\u0027s family is very wealthy, his father being the proprietor of a very successful dairy farm. Lucy has a panic attack in the powder room while at the Fields\u0027--after spilling coffee on her dress, she retreats to the washroom and suffers a flashback because of the wallpaper, which resembles the bars of a prison cell. Carol calms her down and takes her back to the party. Mr. \u0026 Mrs. Fields are cordial until they plot to get Lucy alone so they can have a private conversation with her: Mrs. Fields is suspicious of Lucy, and poor Lucy makes a terrible misstep by revealing to Mr. \u0026 Mrs. Fields that her daughter and Michael are planning to be married. The Fields had not been informed of this yet, and they react disapprovingly. Mrs. Fields in particular gets very haughty with Lucy, making suggestions about her past, and Lucy suddenly snaps at her, revealing that she was in an asylum for twenty years. She says that under no circumstances will she allow the Fields\u0027 to interfere with her daughter\u0027s happiness, and she storms out of the house.Michael drives Emily and Carol back to their house while he and Bill go out looking for Lucy, who has disappeared. Emily sends Carol to bed, but Carol is restless and cannot sleep. With Michael gone from the Fields\u0027 house, Mr. and Mrs. Fields are alone in their house and they hear sounds to suggest someone is prowling around. Mr. Fields is oblivious, but when he goes into his closet to get undressed for the evening, he is attacked by the figure of Lucy, brandishing an axe. Mrs. Fields becomes suspicious and goes looking for her husband, eventually finding his body in the dressing room. Horrified, she retreats, only to be confronted by the figure of Lucy in the bedroom. Before the axe can fall, the bedroom door opens and the real Lucy comes in; after scuffling with the other figure, Lucy tears off a mask to reveal her daughter\u0027s face underneath. Carol has been committing the murders while dressing as her mother; scarred by witnessing the double homicide committed by her mother, Carol\u0027s mind was unstable ever since. Certain that Mr. and Mrs. Fields would never allow Michael to marry her without a great deal of trouble, she plotted to make it appear as if Lucy murdered them in a rage, which would send Lucy back to the asylum and allow her to marry Michael. Her mind shattered, Carol clutches the mask of her mother and screams at it \"I hate you! I hate you! Oh I\u0027m sorry, I love you! I hate you! I love you!\" Outside on the porch, Lucy hears her daughter\u0027s insane ravings and weeps, perhaps remembering her own moment of insanity.An epilogue reveals Lucy discussing her plans with Bill. With Carol now committed to an asylum just as she once was, Lucy intends to stand by her daughter and be whatever kind of support that she needs.","numvotes":"5667","primarytitle":"Strait-Jacket","productioncompany":"William Castle Productions","countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"6.8","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"Strait-Jacket","sex of artist":"female","storyline":"Lucy Harbin has been in an asylum for twenty years after axing her husband and his mistress during a crime of passion, witnessed by her young daughter, Carol.

Julia gets away, but Sam is chased by both the yellow jacket assasin on foot and the black-jacket killer in the black car. After a chase through the streets and a local junkyard, Sam runs out onto a busy street. Sam realizes that the yellow jacket killer will not kill him with witnesses around, Sam then becomes the pursuer. But he loses the yellow jacket assasin who ducks into a hotel meeting room full of yellow jacket men.The next day, Sam visits the pimp in jail again who tells him that he knows a man who can help. Soon after, another man arrives at Sam\u0027s apartment and after he is given money, says he will contact Sam later to find out the idenity of the yellow jacket man who chased him. Then, the killer phones Sam and Julia at their apartment and threatens to kill them. The killer also phones the police station and taunts Morosini with planing to do more killings. Sam and Julia visit the police station where they listen to the recorded phone call where they hear a mysterious creaking sound in the background.The hired man returns to Sam\u0027s apartment and give him the name and address of the yellow-jacketed shooter. Sam goes to the small aparment of \u0027Needles\u0027, but finds the assasin dead from an apparent drug overdose. Later, Sam and Morosini are told by a voice annalyst that Sam\u0027s recorded call and an phone call to the police station placed to Morosini were made by two seperate people. Sam\u0027s friend Carlo hears the background noise and says that it sounds familiar. He takes the tape to listen some more. Meanwhile, the killer strikes again and kills another woman, named Tina, who returns to her apartment after an outing with her boyfriend.When Sam and Julia agree that things have gone too far for them, they make plans to return to America. But the next flight will not be until two days from now. Sam decides to visit the painter of the eerie painting, who lives in a run-down house on the outskirts of Rome. The eccentric artist tells Sam that he witnesses the event of the assault on the girl from over 10 years ago. Back in Rome, Julia is alone in Sam\u0027s apartment when the unseen killer pays her a threatening visit. Sam returns just in time, and Julia is saved, but the killer has already fled yet again.The next day, Carlo arrives where he tells them that he has finally identified the background noise on the tape which is the sound of a rare bird that can only live in Northern Siberia, and the only one that resides in Rome is in the local zoo. Sam and the police arrive at the zoo and realize that it is near the apartment of Alberto and Monica. When they burst into the apartment, the couple are struggling over a knife. When the police intervene, Alberto flees and falls out a window to his death on the street below. As he is dying after the fall, he admits to being the murderer.With the case apparently wraped up, Sam cannot find Julia who had run out of Alberto\u0027s apartment with Carlo and Monica. When Sam tracks them down to a small apartment a few blocks away (the same apartment the killer resides in), he finds Carlo dead and a bound and gagged Julia on the floor. Sam turns around and sees a snickering and wild-eyed Monica holding a knife. At this point, Sam finally remembers what he saw that night: it was not Monica being attacked but it was her husband Alberto trying to stop an attack on HIM! Sam chases Monica through the dark hallways and it leads right back to the art gallery where it all started. Monica drops a heavy sculpture down on Sam, pinning him to the floor. Before she can utilize her knife, the police arrive and subdue Monica.It is revealed by Inspector Morosini that Monica was a victim of a sexual assault and lived with the trauma of it for many years. In a transference-of-guilt, Monica imposed upon herself as the assailent and killed all those women as a way of re-enacting the assault on her and her loyal husband Alberto covered up for her and was the one trying to kill Sam to prevent him from finding out of his wife\u0027s murderous activities. With the case finally wraped up, Sam and Julia fly back to America.","numvotes":"20522","primarytitle":"The Bird with the Crystal Plumage","productioncompany":"Seda Spettacoli","countriesoforigin":"Italy, West Germany","averagerating":"7.1","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"L\u0027uccello dalle piume di cristallo","sex of artist":"male","storyline":"In Italy, American writer Sam Dalmas witnesses a murder attempt on an art-gallery owner, Monica Ranieri, a few days before he\u0027s supposed to return home.

The opening scene shows a native girl, Zuranda (Jean Davis) participating in a ritual and placed on a table. A voodoo doll is placed on her chest. A chicken is waved over her and placed on her stomach and killed. Participating in the ritual is Dr. Roland Gerard (Tom Conway). He draws a sample of her blood.In the doctor\u0027s hut, Bobo, the houseboy (Otis Greene) enters and opens the blinds. He startles Susan Gerard (Mary Ellen Kay), the doctor\u0027s wife. Susan tries to bribe Bobo to help her escape her husband, but he fears the doctor\u0027s wrath. The hut is like a prison with bars on all the windows. Outside sits a guard, Gander (Emmett E. Smith). When Susan gets too close to the bars she gets a little too close to Gander\u0027s spear and she retreats inside. The ritual continues with Dr. Gerard and Chaka, the Witch Doctor (Martin Wilkins).In a bar, Rick Brady (Lance Fuller) and Marilyn Blanchard (Marla English) wait to approach a potential business partner. The bartender, Marcel Chateau (Paul Dubov) assists them in their scheme. Marilyn cozies up to Harry West (Norman Willis) at his table. They know and dislike each other, but they agree to a business venture. Marilyn tells Harry she intends to marry Rick. Rick and Marilyn leave the table after exchanging a few more barbs with Harry. They walk back to the bar and annoy Marcel and have a drink. She tells Marcel she\u0027s going to Harry\u0027s room and to distract their \"business partner.\" Marcel tells Yvette, the singer (Giselle DArc) to keep Harry occupied with a song. Marcel helps himself to his own product. Rick and Marilyn rifle Harry\u0027s room. They are looking for a map of the location of a tribe that has enormous amounts of gold and jewels. Harry notices his \"business partners\" have left. For $5 Marcel sells Harry a gun. Harry is unaware his weapon doesn\u0027t work, but Marilyn does. Harry returns to his room to find Rick and Marilyn examining a gold statue studded with diamonds and rubies. Harry\u0027s gun malfunctions, but Marilyn\u0027s works fine and she uses it to kill Harry. They continue to search Harry\u0027s room. It seems Harry had made arrangements before his untimely death to secure the services of a guide to find the tribe and collect the gold and jewels. That much Rick and Marilyn know.At the ritual, the girl\u0027s feet change. She changes into some kind of blond hairy creature, but we don\u0027t get a very good look. The witch doctor tells Dr. Gerard the change is only temporary. Zuranda is the daughter of the priest in the next village, so the tribe is responsible for her safety. Gerard wants to take Zuranda with him, but Chaka objects. Gerard finally convinces Chaka to let her leave, but just about that time Zuranda changes back to a native girl. Gerard wants the change to be permanent.Marcel comes to Harry\u0027s room to tell Rick and Marilyn that Harry\u0027s funeral is over. For a percentage Marcel arranges such things. He informs Rick and Marilyn there is a considerable fee due and payable. They are waiting for the guide, and since it was arranged by mail, Rick will impersonate Harry. The guide, Ted Bronson (Mike Connors, credited at Touch Connors) arrives at the bar and meets Marilyn. He is suspicious of her motives, but he needs the money.The next day they plan their trip. The three start their trek through the jungle complete with bearers. They decide to make camp just outside the voodoo territory. Gerard has returned to his lab with Zuranda. She screams which upsets his wife back in the hut. Susan enters the lab, against standing orders. Before he can send Susan back to her room, he informs his wife, \"I\u0027m using her to create a new being, not man, not beast, but a combination of the best of each. When I\u0027m finished we\u0027ll take her back to the States with us. We\u0027ll shatter the very foundations of Science.\" Susans reply is terse, \"You\u0027re insane.\" Gerard reminds her if she tries to escape he\u0027ll kill her. Zuranda again transforms. She has claws like a panther. The creature (Paul Blaisdell) is directed telepathically to go to the village. It destroys a hut and chases the couple with the baby inside off into the jungle. But Zuranda has serious qualms about harming anyone, and transforms back into her human form.Resting in the camp, Marilyn asks Ted about voodoo. Marilyn is drawn to the drums and tells Ted she\u0027s going to the north country. Ted informs her it will be without him. The next day Gerard approaches the village and is stopped by the natives until Chaka intervenes. Chaka confronts Gerard with the evidence he made Zuranda attack her own village. Chaka wants her back and Gerard agrees. He is told she will never kill because it is not in her nature to do so. Gerard departs. Ted and Rick get into a fight over Rick\u0027s trying to shoot a native scout. Ted is victorious and takes Rick\u0027s rifle. But the native village now knows of the white man\u0027s presence. Gerard takes his wife down to the lab to see Zuranda. Susan thinks she\u0027s dead. But Gerard explains that she is between life and death--a state of pre-transformation. Gerard smears blood on a doll and then tells Zuranda to get up and walk around the room. Zuranda complies. He injects her with a substance that turns her skin into armor plating. Gerard fires a gun at Zuranda and the bullets bounce off. Even acid has no effect when poured on her leg. Susan accuses her husband of being crazy and gets a slap across the face for it.Ted confesses to Marilyn that he thought she was poison the minute they met, but took the job because he needed the money. He asks for a straight answer, what are they looking for? She makes him a bargain--a 50/50 deal. She wants gold and badly. He agrees to take her as far as Bandaleya. She pulls a gun on Ted and takes his gun. She informs Ted he\u0027s going with her and Rick.When Bobo tries to take a message from Susan to the party approaching he is killed by Gander. When Ted tries to escape, Marilyn ties him up. Rick leaves looking for the village. Gerard is looking for Ted, Rick, and Marilyn. He has Zuranda with him in her transformed state. Gerard finds the camp and directs Zuranda to kill, but she is unable and retreats and transforms back into human form. Gerard admits that Chaka was right, he can\u0027t make her kill. He sends her back to her village. Rick finds the markings on the native totem pole which confirms they have the correct village. Ricks accosts Zuranda. She screams and bites Rick. He hits her and kills her. He walks back to camp and wakes Marilyn. He tells her they\u0027ve found the village. Gerard and Chaka find Zuranda\u0027s body. Chaka informs Gerard, \"White man die for this.\" Gerard agrees, until Chaka informs him that all white men, \"You too.\" They go to the camp and capture Rick, Ted, and Marilyn. They want the one who killed Zuranda. Marilyn rats out Rick. The bite on his hand is the evidence. Chaka insists Rick be executed by a white man, so Marilyn shoots Rick twice killing him. Dr. Gerard cuts Ted loose and they agree to stay with Gerard for a few days until things calm down with the villagers. Of course, Gerard has plans. Marilyn tells Gerard, \"It\u0027s lucky meeting up with you. I\u0027ve got a hunch I can use you in my business.\" Smirking uncontrollably, Gerard slyly replies, \"I\u0027m almost positive that I can use you in mine.\" They go back to Gerard\u0027s hut. Gerard takes Marilyn on a tour of the lab. He surmises, correctly, that gold is Marilyn\u0027s real interest in the village. He tells her he will arrange to make her a priestess. \"Then you can have anything you\u0027d like.\" Susan is locked in her room, but she has a rifle. She leaves her room and Ted notices her. They talk and she returns to her room. Gander keeps Ted inside the hut.At the village, they prepare for another ritual. Gerard and Marilyn arrive. Gerard convinces Chaka to use Marilyn for the ritual. They return the next day, and Marilyn is dressed in native garb for the ritual. Gander falls asleep and Ted goes to the lab. He checks around then leaves to get Susan in her room. Gander wakes and goes outside. He hears Susan and Ted talking. He captures Ted. Chaka and Gerard work on Marilyn. She transforms into the monster. Chaka pulls a ritual knife on Gerard so he takes Marilyn back to his hut after she transforms back into human form. Gerard takes Gander away from guarding Ted for a little task. Unguarded, Ted goes to see Susan. He grabs a knife and departs. In the lab, Gerard preps Marilyn for her new role as his monster/slave. Ted bolts the hut with Gander in hot pursuit. Just before Susan can escape, Gerard arrives with his monster. Susan shoots it with no effect. The monster picks Susan up and takes her in the direction of the village. Ted manages to kill Gander. Gerard escorts his wife the final distance to Chaka as the white sacrifice Chaka demands.Ted finds traces of Susan at the hut and hears Susan\u0027s screams at the village. He is captured by natives and brought to the village to be added to the sacrifice pile. Susan and Ted are tied up by next to a volcanic steam vent. Gerard calls his monster to come get her gold. Gerard is led away to be tied up with Ted and Susan. Ted and Susan manage to slip their ropes and get away as the monster attacks the village. Gerard orders the monster to kill Chaka--He is thrown into the pit. The monster discovers that all the ritual vessels are made of clay, not gold. Gerard informs the monster that the only gold item was the idol that went into the pit with Chaka. The monster feels betrayed and chokes Gerard. The monster returns to human form, now Marilyn. She sees the golden idol near the pit and approaches it. She bends down to retrieve it and falls into the pit, screaming. Ted and Susan return to the lab and mix up a couple of molotov cocktails. They use them to scare the natives and escape.At the bar, Marcel and Yvette are rolling a drunk for his wallet. Yvette gets her cut. Ted and Susan arrive just in time for the bus to town. Marcel asks about Marilyn and Rick and is told they are dead. Marcel comments, \"Her friend perhaps is dead, but not Marilyn. I have a feeling that one still lives.\" We close at the pit/steam vent as the creature crawls out.","numvotes":"557","primarytitle":"Voodoo Woman"},"color":"rgb(119,86,100)","size":1.0},{"source":"cursed art","target":"tt0069341","id":"7183","attributes":{"productioncompany":"Amicus Productions","countriesoforigin":"United Kingdom","averagerating":"6.9","titletype":"movie","notes":"Anthology collection","originaltitle":"Tales from the Crypt","storyline":"Five people come upon a catacomb and take the tour.

Suddenly a hand is seen at the door, trying to get in. Sensing danger, he quickly flees and goes down cobblestone streets and steps until he reaches a stable. Quickly he saddles a horse and secures the straps. He attempts to untie the rope, but suddenly the horse is startled and begins furiously bucking up and down, stomping him to death. Next we see a close-up of his face: half-mutilated with one eye hanging out. (Title shows.)Albert Kovac (Walter Brandi) is driving an open-air touring car down a country lane. He passes an old woman (in a deleted scene, he inquires of the woman where the castle is and she crosses herself). He turns into a drive leading up to a castle (Villa Hauff), parking in front. Removing his cap and putting it in the back seat, he retrieves his briefcase and goes to ring the bell at the front door.The bell will not ring, however. He knocks on the door and pushes it open. Entering, he calls out if anyone is home. He walks down the entrance hall, passing various statues and suits of armor. Hearing a noise behind him, he turns to see the maid, Louise (Tilde Till) who has come out from one of the rooms. He explains that no one answered when he came in. He asks her to introduce him and she opens a door and bids him enter. Inside, Corinne Hauff (Mirella Maravidi) is wiping off a standing suit of armor. He introduces himself and asks if she is the daughter of Dr. Jeronimus Hauff, which she confirms. She tells Louise to take the gentleman\u0027s coat. Louise is staring at Kovac as if she hasn\u0027t seen a man in years. Finally her attention is gained by Corinne and the coat is taken.He explains that he is an attorney who received a letter requesting he come and take care of Dr. Hauffs will. She leads him down a hall toward another room. On the way he notices a display case containing six mummified hands. He follows her into a bedroom where he is asked to show the letter. Giving it to Corinne, she hands it to Cleo Hauff (Barbara Steele) who is seated with cold cream on her face. Immediately she begins wiping her face and looks at the letter. Minutes later she emerges with her face clean and ready to talk.She asks if he is the attorney addressed on the envelope, Joseph Morgan (Riccardo Garrone). He explains that Morgan was absent when the letter arrived so he came at once since it seemed urgent. (In a deleted scene at the beginning of the film Morgan is seen leaving and Kovac reads the mail, finding the letter.) She reads from the letter and remarks how it looks like his writing and seal. He asks if her husband had told her about the letter. She responds that her husband has been dead for a year. Meanwhile there is a flash of lightning and the front door is blown open. Louise closes and bolts the door.Invited to stay the night, they are next seen at dinner, discussing the letter. Cleo speculates that it must be a fraud while Corinne insists that it is her fathers handwriting and seal. Cleo tells Kovac that the seal was buried with her husband and that she is his second wife. Kovac asks to smoke and is told of course . Louise enters and asks if she should serve the coffee. After this is done, she asks if she may be excused for the evening. Cleo excuses her and she politely curtsies to each of the ladies and leaves. Cleo remarks how not even a storm can keep Louise in the castle.Kovac tells them that the police will have to be informed of the death. Cleo tells him that it was Dr. Hauffs wish to be interred in the ground for one year before being laid to final rest. She says the villagers want nothing to do with this place, citing superstitions. Corinne corrects her, telling Kovac that her father was a spiritualist who tried to contact supernatural forces. She points to a bust of a woman which has three scratches on the cheek. He notes that they are real. Corinne says she believes it was done by something supernatural. Cleo tells her not to speak anymore of this. Cleo suggests that Kovac might want to telephone his office. Looking at his pocket watch, he remarks that Morgan is usually in his office at this time.Kovac picks up the phone, giving the operator Morgans number. All at once there is lightning and thunder and strange noises on the line. Outside we see part of the telephone line fall beside the grave of Jeronimus Hauff. Kovac asks the operator what is wrong with the line but she replies there is nothing wrong with it. At this point a strange man enters, carrying a candelabra. It is Kurt, the servant (Luciano Pigozzi) who stares at Kovac. We hear Kovac talking to himself, wondering about the strange man and how much he knows. Kurt closes the shutters and leaves the room just as Corinne enters. She tells Kovac that it is Kurt the gardener and that he has never left since the death of Dr. Hauff. Looking at a painting of the castle and surrounding area, she tells Kovac that hundreds of men died here, since it was once used as a hospital. As for the severed arms, Corinne tells him they are the mummified remains of those who spread the Black Plague. He makes a joke and she tells him not to, saying her father discovered many things about the house. She shows him to her fathers room, telling him to stay there for the night.Inside, he lights a cigarette, thinking of how strange the whole situation is. He finds another adjoining room and takes a candelabra in to see it. It is Dr. Hauffs office, where he finds an old Edison recording cylinder. Cranking it, he turns the needle to play the recording. It is the voice of Hauff, who talks about several people who were spreading the plague. When caught, their hands were severed before they were hanged. The remains were buried on the property. As he describes the sound of the wagon carrying corpses to a mass grave, the sounds of creaking wheels are heard outside. We see covered graves and wagon wheel tracks in the dirt.Corinne begins to undress in her room, when suddenly she turns to look and screams, covering herself. Kovac, hearing the scream, starts to her room. She comes out, claiming that she saw her father in her room. Cleo suggests that Corinne is too tired and on edge and has imagined it all. Entering her room, she reacts to the sight of a bronze bust of her father. Cleo tells her that it is only a statue. As they leave, Cleo tells Kovac that Corinne learned all of these things from her father. She says she will show Kovac where he died. They come to a long stairway going down below. She tells him that Dr. Hauff fell there and died. At the bottom of the stairs we see the face of Kurt, who looks up at them. Meanwhile, the recorded voice of Hauff, playing the last groove of the recording over and over, intones: I summoned them from their graves, and now I am among them.Outside, Kovac finds that an owl has gotten into his engine and caused damage (in a deleted scene we see the owl when Louise is admiring the car). When he asks Kurt how to get into town, he gets no reply. At this point Dr. Nemek (Alfredo Rizzo) walks up, telling Kovac that he will get nothing from Kurt. When Kovac shows the engine to Nemek, he says no one knows how to work on engines. Nemek explains that he is the new doctor for the area. Kovac asks for a ride into town and Nemek agrees. As they walk by the castle, he asks about what he sees. Nemek tells him that these are the unconsecrated graves of the plague spreaders from the fifteenth century. As they walk toward the horse and buggy, Corinne approaches and asks for a ride into town. They all get in and start out.Meanwhile, Cleo in their absence goes through the briefcase, removing documents to read. She asks the operator if the phone line to town has been repaired and is told it has. Then she hangs up.They arrive at a building where Nemek tells them he has to stop for a few minutes. He suggests they take a walk down by the lake. They do.Corinne talks about her father being misunderstood by everyone and that he had supernatural powers. She apologizes about her outburst last night, saying that he was in the room. They walk along the shoreline, past a number of small boats. She tells Kovac that her father used to bring her there often. She points out two sticks in the ground, a large one and a smaller one. Explaining that this is a sundial her father devised, she tells him that when the shadow of one touches the other, the time is right for fishing in the reeds. Turning back the other way, she suddenly screams my father! and runs into the reeds, falling down. Kovac chases her and she tells him that she saw her father in a boat in the reeds. We see it with an oar attached. She claims that the water dripping from the oar means it was just used. He tells her there is no one there. Frightened, she seeks comfort in his arms. Just then Nemek calls them to go back.They are seen in the home of Oskar Stinner (Ennio Balbo), a paralytic in a wheelchair. Corinne is seen dressing behind a sheet in silhouette. Her clothes which were hung by the fire are now dry and handed to her by Dr. Nemek. Kovac smokes and Corinne is shown getting dressed (shown behind the sheet). Nemek tells Kovac that Stinner has a fine wine for them. He gets the bottle and some glasses, explaining that he can smell a good wine for miles. Stinner refuses to drink, but wine is offered to Corinne and Kovac, who suggests they talk about the letter. He shows it to Nemek, who remarks how it looks authentic. Stinner asks to see it, telling them he has an old letter to compare it to. Pulling one out of his desk, he looks at both seals, saying they are the same. Kovac says the police must be informed. Stinner tells Corinne to get out of town before its too late. Nemek says they should get back home and tells Stinner not to worry and that he will come see him tomorrow. Kovac thanks Stinner and exits. Corinne hesitates by the door, telling Stinner she will see him again soon. As they leave, Stinner says to himself I will never see her again. I just know it. The day of revenge is at hand.Arriving at the local apothecary, Nemek tells them he knows the pharmacist who also serves as the mayor. Inside, he calls the mans name but gets no answer. They look around and Nemek continues to call out. As he looks behind the counter, he is horrified to see the man dead, with a bottle of acid dripping on his horribly disfigured face. They immediately get Corinne into the carriage to leave, telling her they will join her later. She drives off to return home.Inside the hall of records, Nemek fills out a death certificate and signs it, stating that cause of death was heart failure. Kovac asks whether the police should be involved but is told that a heart attack is not a violent death. Nemek asks the clerk for two forms, which he brings immediately. Looking at the forms, he asks the clerk why they are already filled out. He is told that the corpse collectors came by the village last night and that everyone knows when that happens that someone will die. Kovac says how could you know it would be the mayor? The clerk tells him it was one of the five men present at the death of Hauff and that they all are doomed to die.Cleo is seen in a bubble bath. Corinne enters and is asked to scrub Cleos back. Taking Corinnes hand, Cleo remarks how she is trembling. Corinne replies that she saw the mayors body, horribly eaten away by acid in the pharmacy. Cleo seems shocked and steps out of the bath. When asked if the mayor was her friend, Cleo says no, but he was one of the men who would come around to see Jeronimus. She states that all his friends were low-class individuals, not like what she was accustomed to. Corinne implies that her step-mother had been a performer. Cleo answers that she had to give up her career to marry Dr. Hauff, who became a crazy country doctor. She tells Corinne that it was not what she expected. Her friends formerly envied her. Rising to leave, Corinne tells her flat out that she is the same lousy actress she always was.Back at the hall of records, the clerk looks up and begins to read the death notice of Dr. Hauff, which was signed by the five men present at the time. He notes that three of them are dead and the remaining two have not long to live. Kovac takes the page with their names to study it. As Kovac calls out each of the three names, the clerk reads the fate of each one from the record. Asking who the fourth man is, the clerk is told Oskar Stinner. It is said that the name of the fifth man is unknown because the handwriting is illegible. Kovac expresses doubt that the friends of Hauff would want to kill him, but the clerk suggests they hated him because he dabbled in the occult.Back in his room, Kovac wonders about the fifth man. He plays the recording, hearing a girls voice singing remember pure water, pure water will save you. Looking out the window, he sees a young girl sitting at the fountain below. He goes down to the fountain but finds only the flowers the girl was holding, now discarded in the water.Stinner is seated at his desk when he hears the sounds of the corpse collectors wagon outside and declares that the end has come. After a torturous moment of worry, he rolls his wheelchair to the wall and removes a sword, which he places point-out from a chest of drawers. Backing up, he rushes upon the sword and kills himself. At this point the window opens from outside and we see Stinner dead from behind. One of the mummified hands is seen upon his shoulder, implying that it had come to kill him but was too late. The hand pulls Stinners wheelchair back off of the sword, which drips. We see from a front angle that Stinners intestines are hanging out. (In a deleted scene there is an alternative death scene where he dies by hanging himself instead of by sword.)Next day a policeman is shown investigating at Stinners place. Nemek tells him he will come by the station later to file a report. He tells the men to take the body away. Kovac asks Nemek if he still believes this is coincidence, to which Nemek replies he isn\u0027t sure anymore. When Kovac reminds him that they both heard the clerk predicting the death but they did nothing, Nemek replies that there is nothing they could have done to have prevented Stinner from taking his own life. Kovac suggests that maybe Hauff is still alive and that his body has not been seen, except by the witnesses. Finding a partially-burned note on the desk, Kovac shows in to Nemek, telling him that Stinner was writing it to warn the final victim, who was summoned. He tells him that tomorrow Hauffs body will be dug up to be re-interred. They are hoping to see the body at that time, which would prove whether Hauff is really dead.The next day at the cemetery a small gathering stands around the temporary grave. As the slab is removed from the grave, those present see that it is empty. Some gasping is heard from the ladies. Kovac thinks to himself so that means the fifth witness is in danger. He is directed to a phone to call his boss but is told he has left for the Villa Hauff. Explaining to Nemek, Kovac says the fifth witness is Morgan, since he was the one summoned by the original letter.Morgan enters the castle and looks around, seeing no one. He goes into another room and hears Dr. Hauff greeting him from a chair across the room (his face is not visible, but as Morgan nervously approaches, he notices a ring on Hauffs hand with a large jeweled J).Kovac and Nemek arrive and begin to search for Morgan. His hat is seen on a hallway table. Morgan comes out from the front room in a state of shock. The men sit him down. He tells them that he saw Jeronimus. When Kovac goes to search the room, he finds only a cat in the chair. He is given a sedative by Dr. Nemek. Kovac demands to know why he has come. Nemek suggests that this discussion take place later. Kovac leaves with an apology, giving Morgan the letter.Next we see Louise preparing to leave, questioned by Corinne about what she saw. She says she saw nothing, only feeling more coldness in the house than during a normal winter. Locking herself in the kitchen in fear, she tells Corinne she heard the voice of Jeronimus speaking. Asking what he said, she says to ask Kurt. At this point she leaves, saying that she can no longer remain in this house.Corinne apologizes to Kovac, telling him it is her fault for asking him to remain. She confesses her need for him and they kiss. At this point they are interrupted by Nemek, who asks for cognac. She goes to fetch it while the men sit down. Kovac tells Nemek that Morgan is highly believable, because he doesn\u0027t believe in ghosts. They both agree that Kurt needs to be found so that what he knows can be determined. Corinne enters with a tray and two glasses, carrying some kind of dispenser which she sets on the table. Nemek seems pleased and Corinne adjusts something on the dispenser.Louise is seen walking through the woods. Bird sounds are heard, which gradually give way to the sound of the corpse collectors cart. Louise looks around but sees nothing. She hurries away.Morgan is awakened by the door opening. Cleo comes in and he stands to greet her. From their conversation we learn that they had agreed to separate for one year after the death of Jeronimus, but Cleo tells him they cant just resume their affair now. Confessing his love, Morgan begins kissing her shoulder. Next they are seen in bed, kissing.Meanwhile Corinne goes to the attic with Kovac to look around. They find a doll, which she explains was hers. It contains a music box which plays. Kovac remarks that he knows that tune. Corinne tells him it is an old song which she then sings. He remembers it from the recording he heard before and wonders what is the meaning of pure water will save you?Cleo listens as Morgan reads the letter sent to his office, which was signed by Jeronimus. She asks if he believes Hauff wrote it. He tells her he knows who is behind all this. Checking his gun, he informs her that there was one more witness there that night: Kurt.Corinne and Kovac go down below into a crypt-like room where she calls out for Kurt. Hearing no answer, they leave. One wall opens and Kurt enters, carrying the body of Hauff, which he lays on the slab. He says to the corpse that the night of revenge has begun. He removes the ring (which contains the J used to make the seal) from Hauffs finger and places it in a torch, which causes it to flare up. Soon the hour of death will come, he says, which will free the spirits of the plague spreaders, who will begin killing the innocent and guilty alike. He confesses his loyalty to Hauff but asks forgiveness for having to break his vow of silence, since Corinne will have to be warned.Nemek asks whether they found Kurt, to which Kovac says no, telling him that they searched the entire house. At this moment Corinne screams as she sees Kurt coming in, his face all covered with oozing sores, signs of the plague. Nemek tells them not to touch him. Kurt says the night of his revenge has begun, and they are here. Pointing to a full-length mirror, he says that one year ago he saw it all happen here. In a flash-back sequence, we see the five men (not including Kurt) and Cleo all facing Jeronimus, who reveals that they had all signed a petition to run him out of town. He refuses to leave, telling them he knows too much about their sins and will alert the public. He addresses each one, telling what he knows. Finally he faces Cleo and Morgan, telling them he had known about their clandestine affair for some time. Morgan approaches him with a candlestick to strike him from behind. Encouraged by each face, he hesitates until Cleo cries out kill him, Joseph! Hauff is struck from behind and falls, cursing them all and telling them that they wont escape his anger.Coming out of the flashback, Cleo tells him to go back to the dead and throws a candlestick at the mirror, breaking it. Hauffs voice is heard summoning the dead spirits of the plague spreaders to avenge him. The grave covers are slid over and we see at least one hand emerging. Cleo cries no and begins to run. She goes from door to door but cannot escape. She opens a double outer door and screams. As she turns back inside, we see her face with signs of the plague. She staggers around the room, getting a glimpse of her face reflected in the tray. Finally she falls upon the harp and breathes her last. Morgan shouts that he will not die. Pulling out his gun, he tells Hauff that he is not afraid but begins acting like he is being stalked. Firing several shots, he too receives signs of the plague and collapses. As Kovac looks at him, he notices on a grandfather clock the painting of the young girl at the fountain, again wondering about the pure water that will save them. (In a deleted scene Kovac is told about the painting of this legendary girl who would save the village with purified water.) Thunder and lightning are heard. All at once he announces that water is the answer. He tells Nemek to take Corinne outside. She protests that she wants to remain with Kovac.Opening up a door, Kovac sees Louise, now covered with the plague. She dies in his arms. He goes outside to join the others. The sounds of the corpse collectors cart are heard and the open graves are viewed. Kovac tells them that it is the water that has kept the spirits away, and now that all the water is drying up, they can only hope for rain. Nemek takes Corinne aside and a mummified hand is seen in the bushes. When we see Nemek again, he has the plague, telling her not to touch him. Kovac stumbles around, backing away from an unseen spirit. Only the shadow is visible approaching him. As he is backed into a corner and sinks down, suddenly the menacing sounds stop and raindrops appear. Corinne calls out that it is raining and the two of them embrace. Saved from the avengers, they are seen walking off together as the rain comes down.","numvotes":"1014","primarytitle":"Terror-Creatures from the Grave"},"color":"rgb(93,99,84)","size":1.0},{"source":"Thriller","target":"tt4552524","id":"7068","attributes":{"productioncompany":"Mifal Hapais","countriesoforigin":"Israel","averagerating":"4.8","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"Jeruzalem","storyline":"American best friends Rachel Klein and Sarah Pullman travel to Tel Aviv to have fun.

It is Hans\u0027 intention to collect information about the Mill of the Stone   Women, as it is known to the locals, and about the current owner,   professor and sculptor Gregorius Wahl [Robert Boehme], whose great grandfather created the   windmill and its eerie stone sculptures one hundred years ago. While   waiting for the housekeeper to summon the professor, Hans notices a   beautiful but sad-faced woman looking at him from behind a curtain. Before   he can say or do anything, he is directed by the housekeeper to wait in   the Professor\u0027s study. The housekeeper locks Hans in the study, but he   cannot miss the wails coming from behind the curtains. Alone in the study,   Hans has a chance to see the many stone sculptures in various stages of   preparation. He also comes upon a drawing of the young woman he just saw   behind the curtain. It is signed \"Elfi, 1912.\"Suddenly, a grinding sound in the next room attracts Hans\u0027 attention.   Curtains open to reveal a moving carousel featuring a diorama of women   from history. A sculpture of Joan of Arc tied to a stake passes by,   followed by Cleopatra holding an asp. Just as suddenly as it began, the   carousel stops as the professor enters the room. He seems a bit taken   aback that Hans has arrived earlier than expected but gives him a pile of   documents and a room on the second floor where he can work in peace. He   also warns Hans that he must complete his studies in six days.The next day, while Hans works hard on his research, his friends   Liselotte [Dany Carrel] and Raab [Marco Guglielmi], both students at the Academy of Fine Arts where Wahl   teaches drawing and sculpture, are discussing how Hans showing up is   causing Liselotte to feel distracted, as she and Hans were childhood   friends. Raab is distracted himself...by the girl posing as today\u0027s model.   Unfortunately, Annelore [Liana Orfei] has just taken a job as a singer in Paris, so   there is no hope for Raab. Later that evening, Hans meets Raab and   Liselotte at a nearby tavern. Liselotte is hoping to rekindle something   with Hans, until Hans asks Raab about the professor\u0027s daughter, Elfi.   Liselotte can see the interest in Hans\u0027 eyes and walks away.The next day, Elfi [Scilla Gabel] comes to see Hans. She begs him to help her and   gives him a key to her bedroom with instructions to meet her there at 11   PM. At 10:30, Elfi calls it a day and goes up to bed. She is accompanied   by her doctor, Loren Bolem [Wolfgang Preiss], who compliments her on her passionate   piano-playing and wishes she felt such passion for him, but Elfi wants   nothing to do with the doctor, even when he reminds her that he\u0027s the only   one who knows her secret. At 11, Hans enters Elfi\u0027s bedroom as planned,   only to find her sleeping soundly, almost as though in death. When he   arouses her, Elfi confesses that she was dreaming of him, and she offers   herself to Hans right then and there. Hans doesn\u0027t resist.On Sunday, there is a scheduled public showing of the carousel. As   the villagers arrive, Hans is informed that he has two visitors, too. It   is Raab and Liselotte. While Raab watches the performance, Hans and   Liselotte hang back in order to express their love for each other.   Unbeknown to Hans, Elfi is standing on the balcony and overhears   everything. Elfi leaves a note on Hans\u0027 desk that says \"I must see you   tonight without fail. No one will be here. You must explain everything,   otherwise...\" When Liselotte faints at the sight of the macabre carousel,   Raab takes her home. The professor calls Hans to his office and tries to   warn him about his daughter\u0027s delicate medical condition. She must not be   subjected to any strong emotions or her life could be in danger. The   warning is pretty clear...Hans is not to mess with Elfi.That night, Hans meets Elfi as she requested. Elfi swears her love   for Hans but is devastated when he tells her that he doesn\u0027t love her and   that their night together was a mistake. She begs him to take her away   with him, but Hans refuses. Elfi grabs a knife and threatens to kill him,   but Hans turns away and heads for the door. Suddenly, Elfi gasps for a   breath and falls to the floor. Not knowing what to do, Hans carries Elfi   to her bedroom and lays her atop her bed. Hans notices a mirror on her bed   and holds it in front of her face. When he sees no condensation on the   mirror, he backs away in horror. Elfi is dead! Hans runs away.Some days later, Hans returns to the mill to confess all to the   professor. Wahl is extremely angry and holds Hans responsible for Elfi\u0027s   murder. He informs Hans that Elfi has already been buried in the Veeze   cemetery, but Hans is confused when he finds a fresh rose on his desk. Who   could have put it there if Elfi is dead? Seeing the state that Hans is in,   Dr Bolem gives him two tranquilizers that cause Hans to pass out. He   awakens to a dream (or hallucination?) of Elfi rising from her bed. He   hears the piano playing, but the door into the parlor is locked. He roams   the mill, sees Elfi laid out in her coffin, hears screams and sees a girl   tied to a chair. Hans is finally confronted by Dr Bolem and Professor   Wahl, who cannot understand what Hans is going on about. Suddenly, Elfi   comes down the stairs, having been awaken by all the shouting. Hans is   speechless, and Wahl arranges for him to be taken by carriage back to town.Now the truth comes out. Bolem and Wahl are trying to confuse Hans,   to make him believe he\u0027s had an episode of madness. Unfortunately, all the   excitement causes Elfi to have another attack. While the doctor prepares   Elfi, the professor fetches the tied up girl (Annelore). The \"treatment\"   involves drawing off all of Elfi\u0027s \"bad blood\" and replacing it with blood   from Annelore along with a special serum developed by Bolem. As Elfi   revives, Annelore dies. Meanwhile, Hans is being taken care of by Raab and   Liselotte. His doctor believes Hans has suffered a nervous breakdown. Hans   is already feeling better and tells Liselotte that he\u0027s going to go to   Danzen, their home town, in order to ask Liselotte\u0027s parents for   permission to marry her.Back at the mill, Wahl is mummifying Annelore\u0027s body in preparation   for creating another statue for his macabre carousel. Bolem is performing   some tests on a sample of blood taken from Liselotte on the day she   fainted at the mill. Liselotte\u0027s blood type proves to be an exact match to   Elfi\u0027s, he tells Wahl, and transfusing Liselotte\u0027s blood into Elfi will   result in a total cure for Elfi\u0027s condition. Wahl can\u0027t wait and readies   the laboratory so that the transfusion can be performed as soon as   possible.When Hans returns from Danzen, he learns from the landlord that   Liselotte has been missing for the past 24 hours. In her room, Hans finds   her purse with her money and papers still in it. On her dresser, he sees a   photo of Liselotte with Annelore and recognizes Annelore as the girl he   saw tied to a chair at the mill. It wasn\u0027t a dream. It wasn\u0027t an   hallucination. It really happened. Looking for proof before going back to   the mill, Hans and Raab visit Elfi\u0027s grave and find it empty. Near the   tomb is a wax dummy of Elfi. Now certain that Hans wasn\u0027t dreaming,   hallucinating, or nuts, they break into the mill.The transfusion is underway in the basement laboratory. Liselotte is   ready, and they only have to anesthetize Elfi. A storm is brewing, and the   strong winds set the arms of the windmill turning. A new sculpture has   been added to the carousel, but the head falls off as the figure passes   before Hans and Raab. Raab picks up the head and recognizes it as the   mummified head of Annelore. Suddenly, a scream pierces the air. As Raab   and Hans struggle to get into the basement, Bolem confronts Wahl with a   request for Elfi\u0027s hand in marriage, but Wahl refuses.Knowing that this will be the last time Elfi will need to be   transfused and that Bolem\u0027s services are no longer needed, Wahl stabs   Bolem in the stomach and gets ready to conduct the transfusion himself. He   first removes Elfi\u0027s \"bad blood.\" When he looks for the serum to transfuse   into Elfi along with Liselotte\u0027s blood, he cannot find it. He finally   thinks to look in Bolem\u0027s pocket, where he finds the syringe...broken in   Bolem\u0027s fall to the floor. With Elfi drained of blood and no hope of   reviving her, Wahl sets the lab burning, grabs Elfi\u0027s body, and rushes   upstairs just as Hans and Raab break down the door into the lab. They   untie Liselotte and carry her from the burning room. As the fire spreads   through the mill, the carousel turns.

Rose","startyear":"2020","runtimeminutes":"55","synopsis":"A young man, Bruyn LeFevre, receives a letter informing him that he has inherited a castle in the Catskill Mountains of Upstate New York. Bruyn meets his girlfriend Jezebel in a local bar and shares the news with her. A punk rock band plays the song \"What You Gunna Eat?\" in the background. He and his girlfriend Jezebel Buxton leave Brooklyn with another couple, Rod Ramington and Anatolia Grossentitten, to claim the ancestral inheritance.   They two couples arrive at the castle and are greeted by a freaky hooded caretaker named Rollo. He shows the couples to their separate rooms. When he is with Bruyn and Jezebel in their room, he begins to tell the group of the cannibalistic history of Bruyn\u0027s LeFevre Family.   Rollo\u0027s flashback story begins in 1664 outside of Kingston, NY. The French Huguenot settlers leave the Dutch city of Wiltwyck (present day Kingston, NY) to establish their own settlement in New Paltz, NY. They nearly starve to death that first winter and to survive they decide to eat the Esopus Indians who had tried to feed them. The cannibal legacy of the LeFevre Family begins. The Huguenots begin inbreeding and living in the woods because they have developed a liking for human flesh.   The tale continues as Rollo tells that British troops, who have taken the region from the Dutch, capture a band of the New Paltz cannibals and burn them at the stake the during the reign of Charles II in 1674.   Later, in 1789, the new American country tries to rid itself of the cannibal scourge. A band of inbred colonial cannibals is dispatched by guillotine.   Rollo\u0027s saga of inbred cannibal feasting then jumps to the Civil War in 1863. The incestuous cannibal offspring attack and devour a bagpiper playing \"John Brown\u0027s Body.\" A troop of union soldiers stumbles across the cannibal band and shoots them down like dogs with their musket volleys. His mad tale ends in peals of demented laughter.   Rollo leaves the room and the stunned couple begin to unpack and relax on the bed. Suddenly cannibal women climb out from under the bed and cannibal men enter through the door and devour the newly arrived couple from NYC. It is a scene of bloody orgy.   The other couple, Anatolia and Rod, are unaware of this development. Anatolia senses something horrible and begins searching the castle for Rod. She runs through the castle calling for Rod who can\u0027t be found. She runs outside looking for him there and rings a bell in warning. She runs to a small red wooden shed and opens the door. She sees Rod\u0027s eaten corpse inside and is grabbed by a laughing, machete- wielding cannibal and killed.   Three days later a nymph is eating a picnic in a field waiting for her lover to meet her. She goes swimming in a river and is surprised by the cannibal band. They chase her back to her picnic blanket and devour her. Meanwhile across town a young girl runs to fetch a priest. The demon has returned to re-possess her mother. The priest, Father Peter, performs a violent exorcism. To refresh himself afterwards he goes for a walk in the deep woods. Fr. Peter stumbles across the cannibal altar and a statue of their hideous god, Moloch. He realizes that a cannibal cult is in the area and he phones a priest friend to meet him with dynamite and guns to destroy the statue, the altar, and the inbred cannibal cult.   Meanwhile, Dixon Orchard is the home base of the cannibal cult. They ride motorcycles and chase down an unsuspecting duo of Clyde and Deke who are passing through the orchard. Deke and Clyde are trapped on a bridge by the cannibals. Deke has a gun, but is overwhelmed and eaten. Clyde jumps to his death from the bridge rather than be eaten by the cannibals.   The cannibals organize a large feast in celebration. They roast several victims and are singing songs, dancing, drinking, and eating human flesh. They begin chanting \"Moloch\" and worshiping their idol when the three priests arrive, Fr. Peter, Fr. Kevin, and Fr. Patrick, and begin shooting the cannibals with pistols. As most of the cannibals are shot down, one cannibal starts a chainsaw and attacks the priests. He too is gunned down. The wounded cannibals are all shot again. Then Fr. Patrick places a large charge of dynamite in the idol and they detonate it. The idol explodes and breaks into pieces on the ground. The demonic spirit of the idol emerges from it and dances in the night sky.   Afterward, a couple walks into a nearby Deli and realizes that the workers are slicing human limbs on the meat slicers. The cannibal deli workers then attack the unsuspecting couple and chase them from the store.

On the night of her arrival there is a torrential downpour. She arrives at the school by taxi, and before she can enter, she witnesses a young blonde girl (Eva Axén) fleeing the building in a panic. Suzy hears the girl shouting to someone just inside the door of the school, but the intense thunder obscures most of her words. When the other girl is gone, Suzy talks to an unidentified person on the school\u0027s intercom, but they refuse to let her inside. Unable to gain access to the school, Suzy gets back into her cab and has the driver take her away. As the cab drives through a nearby forest, Suzy sees Pat running alone through the trees that separate the school from town.The frightened girl is Pat Hingle, and she flees to a friend\u0027s apartment in the nearby town. While alone in the bathroom, she becomes transfixed by a pair of shining eyes outside the window, and a decidedly inhuman arm smashes through the glass, grabbing her. She is pulled out of the window onto the roof, stabbed numerous times, and then hanged by a cord when she falls through the sky light. The huge pieces of glass and metal that break out of the skylight fall on Pat\u0027s friend, killing her by impaling her body and her head in numerous places.Suzy goes to the school the next day and is greeted by Ms. Tanner (Alida Valli), an instructor, and Madame Blanc (Joan Bennett), the vice directress. Madame Blanc is very friendly to Suzy, especially when she realizes she knows Suzy\u0027s aunt Carol. Detectives are there investigating Pat\u0027s murder, and although Ms. Tanner tries to hurry Suzy away, Suzy volunteers a few bits of information. It seems as if there is something that she cannot remember, some realization that she can\u0027t put her finger on. Suzy meets a few other odd characters, including a strange looking handyman named Pavlo (Giuseppe Transocchi) and a blind pianist named Daniel (Flavio Bucci).In the changing room, Suzy meets two other students, Olga (Barbara Magnolfi) and Sara (Stefania Casini). Sara and Olga are not friends, and Olga taunts Sara a little. Although Suzy has requested to board at the school, the rooms are all full and it\u0027s been arranged for Suzy to live with Olga in her off-campus apartment. Although Olga initially seems very bitchy, she and Suzy get along well and have a conversation about Pat. Olga tells Suzy that Pat was a \"busybody\", and that she was always trying to find out things about other people. Suzy thinks back to seeing Pat the night before, and she suddenly remembers Pat shouting the words \"secret\" and \"iris\".The next day, Suzy sees Madame Blanc before classes, and she tells Suzy that her dorm room is now free. Suzy, however, tells Madame Blanc that she\u0027d rather live with Olga. Madame Blanc seems offended by this and walks away in a huff. Ms. Tanner sarcastically tells Suzy that she is happy she\u0027s so \"strong willed\". On her way to class immediately afterwards, Suzy passes by the cook, who is sitting in the hallway with Madame Blanc\u0027s small nephew Albert (Jacopo Mariani). The cook is polishing some silver, and she reflects a beam of sunlight at Suzy, who immediately begins to feel ill. In class, Ms. Tanner keeps pushing Suzy to dance, and Suzy passes out, bleeding from her nose and mouth.The school doctor (Renato Scarpa) puts Suzy on a restricted diet that includes cheese, fruit, and a glass of red wine. Suzy also finds that she\u0027s been moved into the dorms without her consent. Her dorm room is next to Sara\u0027s, and the two of them become friends. As the girls dress for dinner, hundreds of maggots start to fall from the ceiling. Ms. Tanner investigates the upper floor and finds that crates of spoiled food have caused the maggot infestation. Madame Blanc apologizes to the girls, and arranges for all of them to sleep in the practice hall. A wall of sheets separates the girls from the teachers, who are staying with the girls for the night. Suzy asks Sara if the teachers live in the school, but Sara tells her that they leave at 9:30 every night. When the girls sleep, a shadowy figure lays down on the other side of the sheet behind Suzy and Sara. The person has a very distinct, raspy, whistling snore and it frightens Sara, who wakes Suzy up. Sara tells her about a time last year when she had to sleep in a guest bedroom: late that night, she had heard the same snoring in the next room. Madame Blanc later told Sara that the school\u0027s directress stayed in that room, so the weird snoring means the directress is now here. This seems suspicious to Suzy and Sara, since all the girls have been told that the directress would not return to the school for weeks.The next morning, Sara asks Ms. Tanner if the directress showed up last night, but Ms. Tanner denies it. As classes start, Madame Blanc\u0027s young nephew, Albert, is attacked by Daniel\u0027s guide dog. Enraged, Ms. Tanner interrupts class and tells Daniel never to bring the dog back or she\u0027ll have it put to sleep. Daniel yells at her and insists his dog would never harm anyone. Ms. Tanner throws Daniel\u0027s cane to the floor and tells him to get out, humiliating him as he fumbles around trying to find it. Daniel is enraged, and makes a veiled threat to Ms. Tanner: he is blind, but not deaf. Ms. Tanner is furious.That night, after Suzy eats her meal Sara comes into her room and they listen while the teachers supposedly leave. However, Suzy notices that the footsteps are going away from the front door; therefore the teachers are not really leaving the school at all, but going someplace inside. Sara begins to wonder where they go, but Suzy becomes extremely drowsy and can hardly stay awake. Sara takes out a notebook and writes down the number of footsteps as the instructors walk by.Daniel, who has been out at a bar, leaves with his dog. While in the middle of an empty piazza, his dog begins to bark at something. Daniel tries to calm down the dog, but he just gets more restless as they walk. Daniel begins to become frightened and stops, hearing strange sounds that indicate to him someone else is there. We can also see shadowy figures moving in the distance. As Daniel waits silently in the piazza, his dog suddenly attacks and kills him, tearing out his throat.Suzy is troubled by the sudden number of deaths and approaches Madame Blanc. She tells Blanc that she heard Pat say something the night she died. Although Pat had said more, Suzy only heard \"secret\" and \"irises\". Madame Blanc says she will inform the police about Suzy\u0027s information, but Sara later gets angry that Suzy told this to Madame Blanc. Sara worries that Suzy\u0027s revelation has put the teachers on a hunt for whoever Pat was talking to that night, and that the teacher will obviously identify that person as herself. As the two go for a swim in the pool, Sara tells Suzy all about her friendship with Pat, and how Pat had been taking notes for months about strange occurrences at the school. However, when Sara is going to show them to Suzy that night, the notes are gone; now she knows that the evil forces in the school are onto her and her time is short. The only thing she has left is the list of footsteps she made. Sara tries to get Suzy to help her, but once again Suzy cannot stay awake. Sara begins to hear footsteps and flees Suzy\u0027s room just before an unseen person enters. Sara escapes to the attic, where she is attacked but hides in a room and latches the door shut. Her stalker tries to use a strait razor to unlatch the door. With nowhere else to go, Sara cowers away from the door when she notices a small window near the ceiling. Stacking several boxes on top of each other, she leaps through the window and into the next room; unfortunately, the small room is filled to the brim with large, unruly bushels of razor wire. She tries to escape to an open door a few feet away but keeps getting tangled and cut. Just as she is near the door, the killer slices her throat.The next morning, Suzy finds Sara\u0027s room empty. Ms. Tanner tells Suzy that Sara left early that morning without telling anyone. Suzy meets with a friend of Sara\u0027s, who turns out to be Sara\u0027s psychologist. He tells Suzy that Sara became troubled when a friend put the notion of witches in her head. Sara also found out that the school was founded by Helena Markos, a Greek émigré, who people thought was a witch. Markos was persecuted wherever she went, and she founded the school for the study of occult sciences and arts. However, Markos died in a fire, and the school was passed down to her favorite pupil who turned it from a school for the occult to a dance academy. Suzy talks to a colleague of Dr. Mandel who specializes in witches, Professor Milius. Milius explains to Suzy that witches are negative forces that change events only to do harm, and their goal is to gain personal wealth that can only be achieved by injury to others. He also tells her that a coven of witches can only do magic with the power of their queen. Otherwise, they are harmless.Back at school, Suzy finds out that all the students are gone. She asks a servant, who tells her that all the students went to the theater, and that Ms. Tanner got the tickets. Suzy tries to call Frank Mandel, but a storm knocks out the phones. In her room, Suzy dumps her food out, and throws the wine down the sink, which looks suspiciously like blood. Afterwards, she is attacked by a vicious bat that flies in the bathroom window. She begins to hear the teachers footsteps, and remembers counting them with Sara. Following the count, Suzy traces their path and ends up in Madame Blanc\u0027s empty office, where the footsteps stopped. With only one door, she knows the teachers exited somehow. Glancing into a mirror, she notices irises painted on the wall in the elaborate grotto illustration that adorns Madame Blanc\u0027s office. Suddenly Suzy remembers what she had forgotten. When exiting the school, Pat said \"The secret! I saw behind the door! Three irises! Turn the blue one!\"Suzy turns the blue iris and a hidden door pops open. She sneaks down a hallway and, hiding behind a curtain, she sees the entire coven meeting with Madame Blanc, who is sitting on a throne. She and the others discuss how they will kill Suzy. Conducting a black mass ritual, Madame Blanc partakes of some kind of communion wafer and says \"Queen Helena, give me power!\" Afraid they might find her, Suzy backs away and stumbles upon Sara\u0027s corpse. She flees into a connecting room, which turns out to be a bedroom. Asleep in the bed, obscured by sheer white curtains, is a shadowy figure, snoring loudly--the same weird snoring of the directress, whom Suzy now realizes is Helena Markos. Frightened, Suzy knocks over an ornamental statue which wakes up Helena Markos. In a horrible, raspy voice, Helena speaks to Suzy: \"The American girl! I knew you\u0027d come. You want to kill me!\" Suzy picks up one of the sharp glass feathers from the statue and pulls back the curtain of the bed only to find it empty. Confused, Suzy looks around while Markos taunts her. A door slowly opens, and Sara\u0027s corpse, back to life and wielding a knife, approaches Suzy. As lightning strikes, Suzy notices a slight outline of Markos still sitting there on the bed; she is simply invisible. Suzy stabs her through the neck. Sara disappears, and the burnt features of Markos become visible as she dies; the weapon has penetrated through her entire neck, and she chokes to death. Things in the bedroom begin to explode, and Suzy rushes out. As she passes by their meeting room, she sees Madame Blanc, Miss Tanner, and the others, all collapsed and bleeding due to the death of Markos. Suzy runs away, and everywhere she goes, power exudes from her, destroying all in her path. Doors explode outwards before she can touch them, and walls crack and break as she passes. Finally she reaches the exit and walks out into the rain as the house burns behind her. Suzy smiles cryptically as she walks away from the school. Perhaps she is simply happy to have escaped, or perhaps it is as the legend goes, that whoever kills a witch inherits her power.","numvotes":"90183","primarytitle":"Suspiria","productioncompany":"Seda Spettacoli","countriesoforigin":"Italy","averagerating":"7.4","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"Suspiria","storyline":"Suzy Bannion travels to Germany to perfect her ballet skills.

His brother, Jason (Mike Vogel), and his girlfriend, Lily (Jessica Lucas) throw a surprise going-away party for him. Rob\u0027s best friend, Hud (T.J. Miller) is recruited to videotape the event but spends much of his time trying to hit on Marlena (Lizzy Caplan). Rob is uncomfortable when Beth (Odette Yustman) brings a date to the party. Rob and Beth have been friends for a long time and had recently had an affair; their date to Coney Island was recorded on the videotape that Hud is now using to record the party. Rob ended the affair abruptly when he got the job. At the party, he insults Beth, who storms out.Jason and Hud take Rob aside to lecture him about his boorish behavior and encourage him to never let go of those he loves most. Just then, a shock jolts their apartment building. The party rushes to the roof to see what is going on. In the distance they see an explosion and must flee back inside the building to avoid debris. Once they move down to the street, Hud continues to shoot video and captures the image of a monstrous shadow moving down the street several blocks away. The monster knocks over the Woolworth Building, sending a cloud of debris billowing down the street. As everyone decides to evacuate Manhattan by going over the Brooklyn Bridge, Marlena informs Lily that she saw smaller creatures attacking and eating people.As they attempt to cross the bridge, Rob receives a call from Beth. She is at her apartment in the Time Warner Center and apparently injured. Jason becomes separated from the others. As they try to make their way to him, the monster\u0027s tail appears out of the gloom and destroys the bridge. Jason is killed but Rob, Hud, Lily, and Marlena make it to safety. In an electronics store, Hud sees footage of the monster shedding parasite creatures from its back that in turn attack people on the street. Rob decides to rescue Beth, even though it means he will have to avoid the monster. Lily, Hud and Marlena agree to go with him. As they move uptown, the heavily armed military appears to fight the monster as it smashes through buildings just ahead of them.The four take refuge in a subway tunnel and decide to walk the tracks to the Warner Center. In the darkened tunnel, they see scurrying rats and hear unsettling noises. Using the night vision function on the camera, they see the scale creatures crawling along the walls. They try to run but the monsters attack; one bites Marlena. The four barricade themselves in a breakroom. After tending Marlena\u0027s wounds and waiting for the creatures to leave, they walk up into a subway station just outside Bloomingdale\u0027s.The military is using Bloomingdale\u0027s as headquarters. Rob pleads for help in finding Beth. Suddenly, Marlena begins bleeding from her eyes and mouth; shortly thereafter her abdomen explodes. A sympathetic soldier tells the others where they should bring Beth if they rescue her -- the last helicopters leave within the hour as the government has determined the only option for controlling the monster is the carpet bombing Manhattan. When they arrive at Beth\u0027s apartment building, they learn that it as collapsed onto the tower opposite it. Making their way up the standing tower, they then crawl into the collapsed tower and rescue Beth.Rob, Hud, Lily and Beth make it to a helipad as a battle rages against the monster all around them. Lily is pushed into one helicopter and the others into the last. Although an aerial bombardment seems to knock the monster over, it suddenly reaches up out of the debris and strikes their helicopter. It crashes into Central Park. The monster sneaks up on them and bites Hud in half. Rob and Beth grab the camera and take shelter under a foot bridge. They record their final goodbyes on the camera as the bridge collapses around them under the air force\u0027s assault.Epilogue. The military has found the tape several days later. Its final moment is from the trip Rob and Beth took to Coney Island. In it, an object can be seen falling from the sky into the ocean, unknown to Rob or Beth.*The following is all from the POV of Hud\u0027s video camera.The movie starts off with Rob videotaping the start of a typical New York day from an apartment in the North Tower of the Time Warner Center. He goes into the bedroom and chats with Beth, whom he has just slept with. The two agree to go to Coney Island for the day.The tape cuts to Rob\u0027s brother, Jason, as he attempts to get the same camera working. His girlfriend Lily tasks him with documenting Rob\u0027s going away party, and Jason passes the task on to his and Rob\u0027s friend Hudson (Hud). Hud obliges, and takes the camera and begins filming the party.During the party, Beth arrives with a date, much to the disappointment of Rob. The two argue, and when Hud asks Lily why, she reluctantly tells him and Jason about Rob and Beth sleeping together. Hud proceeds to tell a number of guests, and Beth leaves. Rob frustrates her even more by wishing \"luck\" to Beth\u0027s date as they leave.Shortly afterwards, the ground shakes and loud roars are heard in the area. The guests of the party go to the roof and look downtown, and see a large explosion in the vicinity. Flaming debris flies towards the roof, and the guests run downstairs and begin to pile into the street. There is another roar and the head of the Statue of Liberty flies through the streets, landing near Hud. Hud walks over to it, then finds Rob, Jason and Lily and the four watch as the Woolworth Building suddenly collapses. They run into a shop to escape the debris. Minutes later, they exit the shop, and find their friend Marlena - whom Hud has a crush on - babbling about \"it\" \"eating people\".After discussing what they saw and concluding that a giant creature is roaming the city, the five friends decide to make to leave the island. They are cut off, however, when the monster destroys the Brooklyn Bridge, killing Jason in the process. They run back into the city and go into an electronics store so that Rob can try and find a battery for his mobile phone. He finds one and gets a message on his phone from Beth, who is trapped in her apartment. Meanwhile, Hud watches the news and sees live images of the monster rubbing its back against buildings and dropping dog-sized parasites on the ground. The parasites start attacking people. Rob, however, decides to try and help Beth, and the friends all agree to follow him.They make their way further north, towards midtown, and have an up-close encounter with the monster when the army comes and tries to shoot it down. The group panic, and run into a subway to try and escape. When they are below the streets, they discover that they can get to the other side of Central Park from Beth\u0027s apartment by following the train tracks and then turning west down Central Park South, and begin to walk through the tunnels. They are ambushed by the parasites during their walk, and during the attack Marlena gets badly bitten by one. They hastily climb into the abandoned Bloomingdale\u0027s via the 59th Street subway station. They are led by a squad of infantry to an army field hospital, which was set up to care for the hundreds of wounded civilians scattered around the city.Shortly after arriving at the hospital, Marlena is dragged behind a paramedics screen and we see her silhouette gruesomely expand and then explode, some sort of viral effect brought on by the bite she received. Some of the parasites, both alive and dead, are shown in containment cages being examined by a few white-coated scientists. The group are permitted by the sergeant to leave and try and help Beth, but to report at a military evacuation zone by 06:00 that morning. Hud has a minor break-down as they leave, but pulls himself together and they continue towards Columbus Circle in order to help Beth.When they reach the Time Warner Center, they find that the north tower has been pushed over and is leaning against the south tower. Hud suggests that they climb the stairs in the south tower and try and find a way onto the roof of the north one, and they manage to get themselves to Beth\u0027s apartment. When they get there, they find Beth lying on the floor with her shoulder impaled by a length of rebar. The group pull her up, and lead her back down to street level. They briefly see the monster again as they cross the roof of the north tower, and have another encounter with a parasite as the go down the stairwell. Rob stabs it with a fire axe and the four manage to escape. As they run to the evacuation zone - which is just by Grand Central Station - they see the monster step right over the station as they run by it. They hastily try and get on a helicopter, and are separated from Lily, who is put on a different helicopter. Hud, Beth and Rob get on the next helicopter, and begin to evacuate.As they fly over the city, they witness the monster being bombed by various planes and finally get knocked down into a building and under a cloud of smoke. As Hud shouts in joy, the monster suddenly rears up and smashes the rear rotor of the helicopter, sending the chopper circling towards the ground. It lands in Central Park and the group wake up a couple of minutes later, and help each other get out. The pilots are briefly seen in the helicopter dead.Rob injures his leg in the crash, and Hud puts the camera down to help him get away, but when he goes to retrieve it the monster suddenly steps over him and looks down at the camera. Rob and Beth look on from behind the helicopter as the monster bends down and scoops Hud up in its mouth, and for a few seconds the camera is inside the creature\u0027s mouth. The top part of Hud falls out of its mouth - camera and all - and Rob and Beth run over to him sobbing.Rob picks up the camera and carries it with him and Beth, and the two collapse under a bridge near the south eastern corner of the park. They sit there and listen as the bomb-warning siren goes off in the city, and Rob makes a last testimonial to the camera. As he quietly comforts Beth, a bomb drops on the park and the camera gets knocked out of Rob\u0027s hand, getting buried beneath some rubble. Rob and Beth each proclaim their love for each other just before another bomb goes off.The camera pauses, and then cuts to a shot of the ocean from the Coney Island Ferris Wheel. In the far distance, you can briefly see a Japanese satellite fall from the sky and crash into the ocean - a part of the film\u0027s viral marketing campaign. Rob turns the camera back towards him and Beth, and then zooms in on Beth\u0027s face. She says \"I had a good day.\" and then the tape freezes on her smiling face, and cuts to black.At the very end of the credits, there is a short static transmission that, when played backwards, says \"It\u0027s still alive.\"","numvotes":"390728","primarytitle":"Cloverfield"},"color":"rgb(82,77,74)","size":1.0},{"source":"Drama","target":"tt1718182","id":"6626","attributes":{"countriesoforigin":"Azerbaijan, Georgia","averagerating":"5.9","titletype":"movie","notes":"Other arts are more important","originaltitle":"Sahä","sex of artist":"female","storyline":"The story is set in Baku.

David comments on his own unlimited lifespan compared to his creator\u0027s limited one.In 2104, 11 years after the \u0027Prometheus\u0027 expedition, the colonization ship \u0027Covenant\u0027 is bound for a remote planet, Origae-6, with a crew of 15, two thousand colonists in stasis and 1,140 human embryos aboard. The ship is monitored by Walter, a newer android model that physically resembles David. A stellar burst damages the ship, killing 47 colonists. Walter orders the ship\u0027s computer to wake the crew, which includes several married couples. The ship\u0027s captain, Jake Branson, is burned alive when his stasis pod malfunctions. While repairing the ship, the crew picks up a radio transmission from a nearby, habitable planet. Against the objections of Daniels (Branson\u0027s widow), the new captain, Oram, decides to investigate.As the Covenant remains in orbit, an expedition team descends to the earth-like planet\u0027s surface and tracks the transmission\u0027s signal to a crashed alien ship. Crew members Ledward and Hallett are infected by alien spores. Oram\u0027s wife Karine helps the rapidly-sickening Ledward back to the lander where Maggie, the pilot, quarantines them both inside the med-bay. A small, pale, alien creature (neomorph) bursts from Ledward\u0027s back, killing him, and then kills Karine. Maggie attempts to kill the creature with a shotgun, but triggers an explosion which kills her and destroys the lander. The neomorph escapes while a similar creature bursts from Hallett\u0027s mouth.The neomorphs attack the remaining crew members and kill one. The crew manages to kill a neomorph before David, who survived the \u0027Prometheus\u0027 mission, scares away the other, and leads the crew to a temple in a city full of humanoid (Engineer) corpses. David tells them that upon his and fellow \u0027Prometheus\u0027 survivor Elizabeth Shaw\u0027s arrival at the planet, their ship released a black liquid bio-weapon which annihilated the native population and that Shaw died when the ship crashed in the ensuing chaos. After the crew members tell David of their mission, they attempt to contact the \u0027Covenant\u0027 but are prevented by fierce storms. The surviving neomorph infiltrates the structure and kills crew member Rosenthal. David tries to communicate with the creature, but is horrified when Oram kills it. Oram questions David who reveals that the aliens are a result of his experimenting, with the black liquid (formed from the blood of the first Deacon) and a facehugger egg found in the Engineer city, in an attempt to create a new species even more superior to himself, just as he believes himself superior to the humans that created him, and the humans to be superior to the Engineers. He manipulates Oram into being attacked by an alien facehugger. An alien creature (xenomorph) later erupts from Oram\u0027s chest, killing him.As the others search for Oram and Rosenthal, Walter, who has found Shaw\u0027s dissected corpse, confronts David. David explains that he believes humans are a inferior species and should not be allowed to colonize the galaxy. When Walter disagrees, David disables him, and threatens Daniels. Walter recovers (being a superior model capable of self-repair) and confronts David while Daniels escapes as they fight. A facehugger attacks security chief Lope, but he is later rescued by crew member Cole. The now fully grown Xenomorph appears and kills Cole, while Lope escapes and meets up with Daniels. Pilot Tennessee arrives in another lander to extract Daniels, Lope, and Walter, who claims David has \"expired\". After an encounter outside the ship, they kill the Xenomorph and return to the \u0027Covenant\u0027.The next morning, Daniels and Tennessee find out that another Xenomorph burst from Lope\u0027s chest, killing him, and is loose on the Covenant. It matures, and kills crew members Ricks and his wife Upworth. Tennessee and Daniels lure the creature into the Covenant\u0027s terraforming bay and flush it into space.The \u0027Covenant\u0027 resumes its trip to Origae-6, and the surviving crew re-enters stasis. As Walter puts Daniels under, she realizes that he is in fact David, but is unable to escape her stasis pod before falling asleep. David regurgitates two facehugger embryos and places them in cold storage alongside the human embryos before entering the cargo bay containing the colonists in stasis. He then poses as Walter to record a log stating that all crew members except Daniels and Tennessee were killed by the neutrino blast at the beginning of the film and that the ship is still on course for Origae-6.","numvotes":"272635","primarytitle":"Alien: Covenant","productioncompany":"Twentieth Century Fox","countriesoforigin":"United States, United Kingdom","averagerating":"6.4","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"Alien: Covenant","sex of artist":"male","storyline":"In 2104, almost eleven years after the disastrous expedition to the distant moon, LV-223, in Prometheus (2012), the deep-space colonisation vessel, USCSS Covenant, is on course for the remote planet, Origae-6, with more than 2,000 colonists in cryogenic hibernation to build a new world.

Joyous, the couple decide to go tell Dr. Scott the good news.Appearing all through the movie, a Criminologist (Charles Gray) comes on and explains that we are about to embark on a strange journey following the misadventures of Brad and Janet. He mentions that despite the storm clouds gathering, the two decided to go for a long drive in the country anyway even though their spare tire was badly in need of air. He claims that Brad and Janet will have \"a night to remember for a very long, time.\"Back to Brad and Janet, as they drive on, the sun sets and, sure enough, it begins to rain very heavily.

Brad asks him for help, explaining his plight, and Frank smirks and acknowledges that yeah, Brad needs help, and offers him a mechanic at first only to change his mind as \"Maybe the rain isn\u0027t REALLY to blame\" and instead decides to \"remove the cause but NOT the symptoms.\"Frank then goes into an elevator and rises upstairs to the applause of the partying conventionists. Riffraff and Magenta strip Brad and Janet down to their underwear. Brad and Janet then are prodded into the elevator and taken upstairs to Frank\u0027s laboratory.Brad and Janet are led out into the center of an observing room where they are put on display by Dr. Frank N. Furter, now wearing a lab coat and long surgical gloves. The Transylvanian conventionists watch the events from an above balcony. Frank N. Furter then walks over to a box-like shape covered by a tarp and throws off the covering to reveal a tank. He shouts for Magenta and Riffraff to set the controls and start the machinery as the room darkens. Frank himself laughs maniacally as he turns knobs, dials, and wheels as fluids pour into the tank and a humanoid form appears slowly, skeleton first, much to Janet and Brad\u0027s terror.Carefully, Frank N. Furter leads out the humanoid figure wrapped entirely in bandages and cuts them away to reveal a full-grown man with blond hair, tanned skin, blue eyes and a muscular figure wearing only a skimpy golden bikini over his crotch. Riffraff spins some wheels he shouldn\u0027t have while cackling to himself, setting the blond man, known as Rocky Horror (Peter Hinwood), loose. Frank chases Rocky through the lab crying his name as a bouncy song about the creation (\u0027I Can Make You a Man\u0027), Rocky feeling a sense of dread plays. Eventually Frank catches Rocky and scolds him for misbehaving, but says he forgives him as he\u0027s beautiful (\u0027Sword of Damocles\u0027).Then, the deep freeze malfunctions and Columbia squeals, \"Eddie!\" A burly, heavyset biker named Eddie (Meatloaf) rides out on a motorcycle, dressed in black leather, singing about his former glory (\u0027Whatever Happened to Saturday Night?/Hot Patootie\u0027) The conventionists eat it up, enjoying the show, but Frank becomes wrathful that Eddie stole his thunder and takes out a pickax, chasing Eddie into the deep freeze where he is hacked to bits. This puts everyone, even the giddy conventionists into a shocked and somber mood. Frank, tires to pick things up by talking about how beautiful Rocky is in a song (\u0027I Can Make You a Man, reprise\u0027), leading away his new creation to a \"bedchamber\" in a wedding-style procession.The Criminologist comes on again and mentions that Brad and Janet are in trouble now as they are being led away to separate rooms for the night.While separated, Frank N. Furter comes into Janet\u0027s bedroom, dressed as Brad, and seduces Janet. Then he goes into Brad\u0027s room, dressed as Janet and tries to seduce Brad. Brad puts up a little bit of a fight, but is talked into it. Afterwards, Janet feels frightened and used and goes to look for Brad. Meanwhile, Rocky escapes from the bedchamber and is running loose, chased by dogs through the rain outside the castle by the gleeful Riffraff. While wandering the castle lost and afraid, Janet encounters Rocky hiding in his tank at the lab. Seeing that he\u0027s injured, she tears her petticoat to bandage his wounds, pausing as she realizes she\u0027s aroused.The Criminologist comes on and mentions the complexity of human emotions and the dangers of lust. He fades away to Magenta and Columbia who are secretly watching Rocky and Janet in the tank via a monitor in their room.Janet tries to seduce Rocky, explaining that she used to be a virgin, but now she finds she really likes sex and wants it NOW (\u0027Toucha Toucha Touch Me\u0027). Rocky is more than happy to oblige. Meanwhile, Columbia and Magenta watch in secret from the closed circuited TV, laughing and playing with one another, making fun of the events unfolding before them.As the two women enjoy one another, Frank N. Furter beats up Riffraff for letting Rocky loose, while Brad watches with horror. An alarm goes off and Riffraff looks on another TV monitor and mentions that someone is outside by the main gate as they all look and see a middle aged man in a wheelchair buzzing the intercom at the front gate. Dr. Everett Scott (Jonathan Adams) has arrived at the castle. Brad recognizes his old teacher and is happy to see him, but Frank N. Furter is angry that the two know one another, recognizing Dr. Scott as a federal agent investigating UFOs, suspecting Brad and Janet are actually spies. Brad denies this, explaining that Dr. Scott is his science teacher from Denton High, but Frank doesn\u0027t believe him.Meanwhile, Dr. Scott enters the castle and finds himself alone in the \u0027zen room\u0027 filled with various smoldering insence. Frank N. Furter takes Brad to the lab where he turns on a powerful magnet to drag Dr Scott\u0027s wheelchair up to them... with Dr. Scott still inside it. The clunk of Dr. Scott\u0027s wheelchair arriving wakes the sleeping Janet and Rocky who sit up in shock. Everyone in the room is frightened, confused and hurt to see one another here. Magenta appears up and announces that dinner is ready. Attempting to handle things with grace, Dr. Frank N. Furter dismisses everyone for dinner, informing them that formal attire is optional as he stomps off enraged.Everyone meets in a grand dining room for a dinner of roasted beef and vegetables in honor of Rocky\u0027s Birthday. Frank demands that everyone sing Rocky \"Happy Birthday.\" Dr. Scott reveals in a song (\u0027Eddie\u0027s Teddy\u0027) that he\u0027s not here to investigate Frank and his household, but to look for his nephew, Eddie, who went missing with a cryptic cry for help in a letter being the last contact he had from him. Sure, Eddie was a no good kid, but he\u0027s still family. In response to this, the tablecloth is pulled off the table to reveal Eddie\u0027s hacked-up body in a glass case... and the fact that they were being served roast Eddie for dinner. Brad and Dr. Scott are paralyzed with terror, and Janet runs to Rocky\u0027s arms. Frank is outraged, slapping Janet. Janet runs away with Frank chasing after her, encouraging her through a song (\u0027Once in a While\u0027) to stop sleeping with everyone else as she\u0027s now his.Janet, followed by Frank N. Furter, Rocky, Brad, and Dr. Scott end up in the lab again. Frank pulls a switch to \"glue\" everyone\u0027s feet to the floor but his. Everyone tells Frank he\u0027s a \"Hot dog.\" In response, he simply flips a switch and turns them all to stone. Columbia comes in and tells Frank he\u0027s gone too far this time as now people are really hurt. Frank N Furter simply responds by turning Columbia to stone, too. He then tells Riffraff and Magenta to prepare for the floor show.The Criminologist comes on and hints that in this place where nothing\u0027s as it seems, the Floor Show is going to be something very shocking.The next scene we see the statue versions of everyone on stage, now all wearing fishnets, makeup, a thong and the same bustier. One by one they are unfrozen, and they each sing and dance a song (\u0027Floor Show\u0027) about how they\u0027ve changed since they came here. Rocky and Columbia sing about their past times (\u0027Rose Tint My World\u0027). Frank N. Furter, Brad and Janet sing their own version (\u0027Fanfare/Don\u0027t Dream It\u0027). Dr. Scott is accidentally unfrozen and realizes that this place is a trap and everyone should run while they still are sane enough to escape. Frank N. Furter comes out like a prized showgirl and sings a solo, starting an orgy in a swimming pool that is uncovered as he sings. After the orgy, Frank N. Furter sings a song praising his wild and untamed household (\u0027Wild and Untamed Thing\u0027).This song, however is interrupted by Riffraff and Magenta, now wearing strange uniforms and armed with laser ray guns. Riffraff informs Frank that it\u0027s all over as his mission was a failure due to Frank becoming too extreme. He declares that Frank is now his and Magenta\u0027s prisoner as he has been made commander, and that they\u0027re going back to their home planet of Transylvania in the Galaxy of Transexual immediately. Frank is happy for this, singing about how long he\u0027s been wanting to go back to the homeland he was exiled from (\u0027I\u0027m Going Home\u0027). Riffraff stops him again and explains that only he and Magenta are going home; Frank N. Furter is to be killed as Riffraff replies: \"say hello to oblivion\". Riffraff points a ray gun at Frank, but Columbia screams in an attempt to save Frank. Riffraff quickly turns around and kills her. Riffraff then kills Frank as he tries to run away. Rocky, seeing his creator fall, grabs Frank and climbs the set in the background of the stage, crying in rage and pain. It takes several shots from the ray gun, but Rocky is killed and falls into the pool where he and his creator float dead.Riffraff turns to Brad, Janet and Dr. Scott and tells them to leave now while they still can and they do so. Meanwhile, in a now empty house, Magenta and Riffraff celebrate going home as an incestuous relationship is implied. Brad and Janet, carrying Dr. Scott, escape just as the castle explodes and flies away under a rainbow and blue skies of dawn back to Riffraff and Magenta\u0027s home planet, leaving Dr. Scott, Janet, and Brad writing on the charred ground, still in drag from the floor show as it flies away into space. (In some versions the three of them sing one final song about loss of innocence called \u0027Superheros\u0027.)The Criminologist comes back one last time with the somber, iconic lines describing the flying away of the house:\"And crawling... on the planet\u0027s face... some insects... called the human race.

In Italy to promote his latest work, entitled Tenebrae, he is accompanied by his literary agent Bullmer (John Saxon) and his adoring assistant Anne (Daria Nicolodi). He is unaware that he is also being followed by his embittered ex-wife Jane (Veronica Lario).Immediately prior to Neals arrival in Rome, a beautiful young shoplifter (Ania Pieroni) is brutally razor-slashed to death by an unseen killer. The murderer sends Neal a letter informing him that his books have inspired him to go on a killing spree. Neal immediately contacts the police, who put Detective Giermani (Giuliano Gemma) in charge of the investigation, along with the detectives female partner Inspector Altieri (Carola Stagnaro).More killings occur. Tilde (Mirella D\u0027Angelo), a beautiful lesbian journalist, is murdered at her home along with her lover by the unseen killer who has a straight-razor blade. Later, Maria (Lara Wendel), the teenage daughter of Neal\u0027s landlord, is bloodily hacked to death with an ax after stumbling into the killer\u0027s lair.Neal notices that TV interviewer Christiano Berti (John Steiner) appears to have an unusually intense interest in the novelist\u0027s work. At night, Neal and his second assistant Gianni (Christiano Borromeo) watch Berti\u0027s house for suspicious activity. Neal decides to separate from Gianni in order to get a better view. Alone, Gianni watches in horror as an ax-carrying assailant brutally hacks Berti to death. But he is unable to see the murderer\u0027s face. Gianni finds Neal unconscious on the lawn outside the open front door, claiming to have been knocked out from behind.The next day, Giermani\u0027s investigation of the crime scene reveals that Berti was unhealthily obsessed with Neal\u0027s novels, and now that he is dead it is believed that the killings will cease. However, Bullmer, who is having an affair with Jane, is stabbed to death while waiting for his lover in a public square.That evening, Gianni is haunted by the thought that he had seen, but did not recognize, something important at Berti\u0027s house during the night of the interviewer\u0027s murder. He returns to the house and suddenly remembers what was so important: he had heard Berti confessing to his unseen attacker, \"I killed them all, I killed them all!\" Before Gianni can share this important detail with anyone, he is attacked from the back seat of his car and strangled to death by an unseen assailant.Meanwhile, Jane sits at her kitchen table when a figure with an ax leaps through her window, hacking off one of her arms. She spews gallons of blood over the kitchen walls before falling to the floor, the killer continuing to hack at her until she is dead. Neal is revealed to be her killer. Upon learning the details of Berti\u0027s sadistic murder spree, Neal had suddenly been overwhelmed by a forgotten memory involving Neal\u0027s murder of a young woman (Eva Robbins) who had sexually humiliated him when he was a youth in Rhode Island. The memory now constantly torments him and has inflamed his previously repressed lust for blood. Neal has become completely insane. Berti was the killer of Tilde, Maria, and all the other women by razor, but it was Neal who killed Berti, along with Bullmer, Gianni and Jane.When Inspector Altieri arrives at the house a few minutes after Jane\u0027s death, Neal kills her too. Later, Giermani and Anne arrive at the house in the pouring rain, and when Neal sees that he cannot escape, he commits bloody suicide in front of them by slashing his neck with a straight razor. Anne runs outside to her car for a moment. Giermani relaxes and is suddenly murdered by Neal, who had faked his own death. Neal waits inside for Anne to return, but when she opens the door and just at Neal is about to kill her too with the ax, she accidentally knocks over a metal sculpture that impales and kills the demented writer.

We open with a woman, Carolyn Hayes (Jana Lund) running towards the camera. She is being chased by a man, Hans Himmler (Mike Lane). She stops, looks back, screams, and then continues running. We only see the man from the waist down as he plods along with a limp. The woman is cornered, now at the same location where the titles and credits were shot. The creature approaches as the woman walks backwards into the lake. The monster grabs the girl, then holds her under water. The director, Douglas Row (Don Red Barry) calls, \"Cut!\" The actor playing the monster does not speak English, so Shuter (Norbert Schiller) must translate. Morgan Haley (John Dennis), the cameraman, confirms that the scene was ok. Doug checks the length of the scene with Judy Stevens (Charlotte Austin). Doug and Judy are divorced and things are still a little frosty in their relationship. He tells her, \"Jealousy, jealousy, lover. Don\u0027t blame me because you\u0027re no longer an ingénue. Well, I keep you on the payroll, you\u0027ll have to admit I\u0027m loyal.\" She tartly replies, \"Oh yes, you\u0027re loyal to wives number one through four inclusive.\" Carolyn is helped from the water. She tells Mike Shaw (Tom Duggan) that this movie scene is to celebrate the 230th anniversary of Frankenstein.Inside the castle, Baron Victor von Frankenstein (Boris Karloff) berates his old friend Wilhelm Gottfried (Rudolph Anders), \"How could you inflict these people upon me Gottfried?\" Gottfried reminds the Baron that he agreed to let the film crew use his castle for the money he needed to purchase a reactor for his experiments. He adds, \"I\u0027ve been wanting to talk to you about this Victor. You have been spending money and money. You have been buying equipment as though you were a government.\" Gottfried has been handling the Baron\u0027s finances and has sold most of his art treasures. The discussion turns to the past. The Baron was tortured during the past and is bitter and scarred. He sports a long scar that runs from his left eye to the corner of his mouth. It is apparent that his nose was severely broken. He was forced to perform medical experiments. The Baron is the last of the House of Frankenstein. The film cast and crew return to the castle. Doug Row briefs the Baron on his upcoming performance. Doug is pushy and obnoxious. The Baron is having reservations about involvement in this exploitation of his family history, but he wants that atomic reactor badly and reluctantly cooperates with Row. He has contempt for all but one. He is strangely attracted to Carolyn Hayes and tells her so, \"That could be my pleasure with you as my leading lady, Miss Hayes.\" He takes her hand and kisses it. She recoils slightly, repelled by the Baron\u0027s clumsy advances. Turning back to the director, the Baron tells him, \"Mr. Row, I\u0027m becoming reconciled to your presence here. Your coming here may be the solution to all my problems.\" The Baron laughs maniacally then limps away. He seats himself at an organ and plays a melancholy tune.It is rehearsal day in the basement of the castle. The Baron reads an inscription on the tomb of an ancestor. \"I, Frankenstein, began my work in the year 1740 and with all good intentions and humane thoughts to the high purpose of probing the secrets of life itself - with but one end - the betterment of mankind.\" He explains his ancestor\u0027s work, as he limps around the basement, and what went wrong. The scene is disrupted when Carolyn screams as the Baron appears ready to stab the corpse on the slab. Hans tells Shuter he is finished and will no longer work at the castle. Row\u0027s cash payment convinces Hans to remain. The Baron was off script, as Judy reminds her ex-husband, but Doug loved it anyway.The cast and crew are relaxing in the great room of the castle. Mike is on the phone. Carolyn, Gottfried, and Judy are relaxing and having coffee. The Baron is playing the organ. Judy presents Shuter with a gift, a plaid scarf. She wraps it around his neck, then gives him a friendly kiss on the cheek. The Baron is not amused. He confronts his servant, \"Shuter. You are richly endowed to have one as lovely as Miss Hayes bestow gifts upon you.\" Row enters the room with script changes, then exits with Carolyn under the pretext of going over her new scene. Gottfried confronts the Baron with his concerns. It seems that the Baron has been working with the Director of the Morgue. \"Are you interested in corpses?\" He asks the Baron. The Baron makes his friend uneasy with his menacing demeanor. The Baron lights a candle, douses the lights in the Great Room, then descends the stairs to the basement crypt. He twists the head on a statue. A stone crypt lid slides open. The Baron climbs inside and descends the stairs to his secret lab below. A large modern lab is revealed. The walls are covered with electronic equipment and the centerpiece is a nuclear reactor. The Baron listens in on his guests with hidden microphones in their rooms. Studying an old picture of himself, he admires a clay bust - still a work in progress. He opens the reactor door and a gurney of a bandaged figure emerges. The head is just a skull. The Baron dons a lab apron, and washes his hands. Shuter is upstairs securing the castle. The Baron returns to his creature, another work in progress. He removes the bandages on the arm. He records his observations on a reel to reel tape machine. Shuter walks downstairs to the crypt area, securing it for the night. He activates the crypt door by accident. He investigates the open sarcophagus, walks down the hidden stairs, and encounters the Baron. The Baron is sorry to see his old friend and trusted servant has discovered his secret, \"Shuter. Ah, my poor Shuter. Why did it have to be you?\" He becons his servant to approach the body and promises that he will live again. He hypnotizes Shuter. The Baron harvests Shuter\u0027s heart for his creation.The next morning Carolyn is fixing breakfast. She notes that Shuter is absent. Judy calls for Shuter, but he is gone. The Baron explains that Shuter is away visiting relatives and may be away for some time. The Baron returns to his lab. He notes that Shuter\u0027s brain is now in the skull of his creature. He prepares to install the eyes. He retrieves a pair, in a glass jar, from the lab refrigerator. The closing door bumps his arm and he drops the container. The eyes are destroyed.Sometime later, Gottfried is reviewing some papers in the library as the Baron plays his organ. Carolyn enters and joins the Baron at the organ. He turns to ogle his guest, \"You seem rather disturbed my dear.\" She tells the Baron that organ music reminds her of death. The Baron notices Carolyn has Shuter\u0027s scarf. She tells him she found it down in the basement. The Baron takes the scarf from Carolyn, places it around his own neck, and then resumes playing his creepy tune. Gottfried enters and asks where Shuter has gone. He notes Shuter has no relatives and a quick search of his room revealed all his clothes are still there. The Baron threatens to tell Gottfried the tale of the inquisitive Commandant of the prison camp. The Baron delights in recounting the tale telling Gottfried that one day his tormentor was found without a tongue. He is gleeful, \"Imagine the irony of it Gottfried. Oh, I know, I was called in to examine the poor wretch. A beautiful piece of surgery, if I do say so myself. Beautiful.\" Gottfried seems to get the message and leaves the room.In the lab, the Baron moves his creature back into the reactor and closes the door. He starts the reactor, and steam wafts from the machine. The demand for power causes the lights in the castle to dim. An alarm bill signals the completion of the process. The body is brought out of the reactor. The Baron\u0027s intercom allows him to hear Doug\u0027s unsuccessful attempt to gain access to Carolyn\u0027s locked room. The Baron examines his creation. Judy types in her room, while Mike sleeps fitfully in his. The Baron\u0027s creation is now standing, still strapped to the gurney. He attempts to contact the mind of Shuter, now encased in his creation. Finally the EEG shows a reaction. He orders Shuter to raise each arm, the creature follows the instructions. The last order of business is to secure a pair of eyes. Mike visits Judy in her room. He has a bottle and glass. Mike kisses Judy, then pours and downs a glass of liquor. He tries another pass, but gets thrown out of Judy\u0027s room. She locks him out and tells him to go to bed. A subsequent knock at the door brings Judy back to scold Mike. When she opens the door the creature is there. She screams and faints. It carries her to the lab, but the Baron chastises his creation. He wanted Row\u0027s eyes. Her eyes were unsuitable and the Baron puts them in a disposal device.Doug and Mike argue over Judy\u0027s sudden disappearance. Doug is skeptical considering she left without an alimony check. The Baron claims to know nothing about it. Row suggests using the Baron\u0027s lab as a setting for the TV show. The Baron asks, \"Gottfried, is the laboratory included in the contract with Mr. Row?\" The answer is no, which prompts the Baron to reply, \"Then you cannot use it.\" When pressed, the Baron is adamant -- the answer is NO!Morgan and Carolyn go to the basement crypt to set up shots. Carolyn practices her moves, unaware the creature is behind her in shadow. Carolyn leaves and Morgan remains to line up a few more shots. He looks through his lens and pans around the room. The creature comes into frame and approaches the cinematographer. Back in the lab the Baron examines the eyeballs, but declares them unsuitable due to blood type mismatch. Another pair of eyes are disposed. Inspector Raab (Irwin Berke) takes a missing persons report from Doug Row. The Baron tells the policeman that Judy was married to Mr. Row, so she must have been emotionally disturbed and Morgan went to Frankfurt to get a special lens. Carolyn tells Raab she last saw Morgan in the basement. The Baron volunteers to escort Raab to see for himself. While all are down in the basement looking for Morgan, the Baron sees the sarcophagus lid swing open. He closes it. Finding nothing, Raab apologizes to the Baron for the intrusion.Gottfried comments to the Baron on all the disappearances. The not so subtle reminders to those who question him gone unheeded, the Baron finally agrees to satisfy Gottfried\u0027s curiosity. They descend into the crypt. The Baron opens the sarcophagus entrance to his lab. The creature stares at his next victim through opening in the bandages where eyes should be. The Baron kills his old friend and installs the eyes in his creation. He disposes of Gottfried\u0027s clothes in the disposal. Doug and Mike examine the crypt area for clues. Doug finds Morgan\u0027s view finder. He tells Mike he intends to report this to Inspector Raab. The Baron uses a coin from his collection to hypnotize Mike Shaw. He questions Mike about Row. He directs Mike to get Carolyn at a designated time. Row meets with Raab. He convinces Raab that Judy, Shuter, and Morgan never left the castle. At the designated time Mike fetches Carolyn from her room. Carolyn is confronted by the still bandaged creature. As Raab and Row drive back to the castle, the creature carries Carolyn down to the Baron\u0027s lab. She wakes and screams. Carolyn pleads with Shuter to bring her back upstairs. He is conflicted between his affection for Carolyn and the Baron\u0027s orders. The Baron fires up his machine. Shuter enters the lab without Carolyn and trashes the place. He walks towards the Baron and is overcome by the atomic steam.The charred remains of the Baron\u0027s creation is prone on the floor. A man in a radiation suit takes readings. He allows Raab to enter the lab. Two police officers, Row and Mike also walk in. Raab peels back the bandages on the face of the creature. A younger, unscarred Baron\u0027s face is shown. Row plays back the tape and hears, \"I made you in my image so the name of Frankenstein could survive. I gave you eyes, ears, a heart, a brain and.\" The voice fades out. We close with a close-up of the creature\u0027s head with the face of the Baron.","numvotes":"1158","primarytitle":"Frankenstein 1970"},"color":"rgb(119,86,100)","size":1.0},{"source":"Mystery","target":"tt1718182","id":"6628","attributes":{"countriesoforigin":"Azerbaijan, Georgia","averagerating":"5.9","titletype":"movie","notes":"Other arts are more important","originaltitle":"Sahä","sex of artist":"female","storyline":"The story is set in Baku.

As a means of coping with these recurring nightmares and at the request of his girlfriend Lori (Anne Bobby), Boone is seeing psychotherapist Dr. Phillip K. Decker (David Cronenberg), who convinces Boone that he has committed a series of gruesome murders. In reality, Decker is a serial killer who dons a grotesque mask and has been murdering several families, all whom he sees as disgusting \"breeders\". Decker attempts to pin the blame for his killing spree on Boone. He gives Boone a bottle of lithium (actually a hallucinogenic substance) and twenty four hours to turn himself in. Boone wanders the streets in a hallucinogenic haze. He is hit by a truck and taken to a hospital.In the hospital, Boone overhears the drug-addled cries of Narcisse (Hugh Ross), who is waiting for the monsters to take him to Midian. Narcisse, led to believe Boone is a messenger from Midian sent to test him, tells Boone the way, before tearing the skin from his face with a pair of razors, in order to show his \"true face\". Boone escapes the hospital and makes his way to Midian, an entire city standing under a massive graveyard. Boone encounters two supernatural creatures named Kinski (Nicholas Vince) and Peloquin (Oliver Parker) who inhabit the city. Kinski says they should take him below but Peloquin states that whereas they are \"Nightbreed\", Boone is a \"natural\" and thinks he should die. Boone pleads with them, claiming he is a murderer and hence belongs with the monsters, but Peloquin says he can smell innocence. Peloquin transforms himself into a more monstrous state and bites Boone on the shoulder intending to devour him, but Boone manages to escape and leaves the graveyard, only to run into an entire squad of police officers waiting outside the gate with Decker. Decker tries to get Boone to surrender and suddenly yells that Boone has a gun. Boone is then gunned down by the police. At the morgue, Boone comes back to life due to Peloquin\u0027s bite becoming a Nightbreed. He makes his way back to Midian where Narcisse has also returned to. Boone is schooled in the laws of Midian and is inducted into Midian\u0027s society by Dirk Lylesburg (Doug Bradley), the leader of the Nightbreed. Lylesburg dips his hand into blood of Baphomet (the deity of Midian) and presses it to Boone\u0027s chest, completing his induction ceremony.Lori, seeking to understand why Boone left her, resolves to investigate Midian for herself. She befriends a woman named Sheryl Anne (Debora Weston) and drives out to the cemetery. She wanders into the cemetery, leaving Sheryl Anne waiting at the car. She finds a dying creature out in the sunlight and at the pleading request of a Nightbreed woman named Rachel (Catherine Chevalier), picks it up and takes it into the shadows, where it transforms into a little girl who happens to be Rachel\u0027s daughter Babette, who is sensitive to sunlight. Lori asks after Boone, only to be rebuffed by Lylesburg, who assures her that Boone is now Nightbreed, and hence no longer part of her world. Lori tries to make her way into Midian but is scared off by Peloquin. As she leaves the cemetery, she is greeted by the sight of Sheryl Anne\u0027s dead body and her new boyfriend, who reveals himself as Decker. He tries to kill Lori in an attempt to bring Boone out of hiding. Decker chases Lori back into the cemetery where he knocks Lori unconscious. Before he can kill her however, Boone appears. Decker stabs him only to learn that Boone cannot be killed due to his supernatural transformation. Decker manages to escape and Boone takes Lori into Midian, where she regains consciousness deep inside the city. Lori is told of the history of Midian by Rachel: the monsters of lore were peaceful beings, hunted to near extinction by frightened and superstitious humans. Boone and Lori are then banished from Midian by Lylesburg. Meanwhile, Decker interrogates a local mechanic who once wanted to join the Nightbreed and learns how they can die. He then murders the residents of the hotel where Boone and Lori are staying. Boone finds the murder scene. Unable to control his thirst for blood, Boone takes a taste. The police find him and take him into custody. At Decker\u0027s urging, the local police and militia led by a bloodthirsty police captain named Eigerman (Charles Haid) form up a small army to attack Midian. They release a drunken priest named Ashberry (Malcolm Smith) to serve them as God\u0027s servant in the battle. Lori, Rachel, and Narcisse race to the jail to release Boone. Lori shows Boone that she loves him even as a \"monster\". The four head back to Midian where Boone convinces the scared Nightbreed to fight back.During the battle, Ashberry is horrified to learn that there are women and children among the Nightbreed and tries to stop the attack, but is roughly beaten down by Eigerman. Ashberry then finds the statue of Baphomet. He drops his cross and Bible and moves forward to swear allegiance, but is splashed and severely burned by the blood of Baphomet and transformed. The Nightbreed manages to fight back, but Boone learns from Lylesburg that Baphomet is going to destroy all of Midian. He tells Lylesburg to release the Berserkers, a monstrous, feral breed that were imprisoned due to their sheer insanity. Lylesburg attempts to open the cages but is killed, leaving Boone to release them. The Beserkers attack the humans furiously, turning the tide of the battle as the humans flee in fear. Boone and Decker then face each other in the burning wreckage of Midian. The two fight and Boone kills him. Boone then goes to Baphomet (Bernard Henry), who says that he has caused the end of Midian, but also that this was foretold. Baphomet charges Boone with finding a new home for the Nightbreed and renames him \"Cabal.\" Boone makes his way out of Midian with Lori. The remaining Nightbreed meet in an old barn. Boone says his goodbyes to Narcisse promising that he will not forget the Nightbreed and that he will find a place where they will all be safe.Meanwhile in the ruins of Midian, Ashberry stands in front of Decker\u0027s corpse and states that he wants to exact vengeance on Baphomet and the Breed. He takes some of the blood of Baphomet and pushes it into Decker\u0027s chest wound. Decker suddenly springs back to life with a scream as Ashberry chants \"Hallelujah\" over and over again.Alternate endingIn an alternate ending (as used by The Cabal Cut of the movie), the Nightbreed await Boone in a barn whilst Boone says his goodbyes to Lori as he must venture the world to find a new home for them, but he promises to return to her. Lori, fearing she will be elderly when the time comes whilst Boone will retain his youth, stabs herself and dies. Boone is forced into resurrecting her into another Nightbreed. At first the revival doesn\u0027t seem to work, but it is eventually successful.Elsewhere, Captain Eigerman wanders the underground remains where he stumbles upon the transformed Ashberry who desires revenge. Eigerman shares this desire, but Ashberry rejects him and kills Eigerman and begins his hunt for the Nightbreed.","numvotes":"22535","primarytitle":"Nightbreed"},"color":"rgb(82,77,74)","size":1.0},{"source":"Fantasy","target":"tt2914740","id":"6844","attributes":{"notes":"Comedy or satire; Queer cinema (?)","runtimeminutes":"79","numvotes":"2437","primarytitle":"Deep Dark","productioncompany":"Polluted Pictures","countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"5.0","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"Deep Dark","sex of artist":"male","storyline":"Hermann, a failed sculptor, is about to kill himself when he finds a strange, talking hole in the wall.

A small village nestled between steep mountain peaks. The camera pans slowly to the top of Trollenberg Mountain\u0027s rugged face. A single small cloud clings to the side .Two climbers (Jeremy Longhurst and Anthony Parker) huddle together on a ledge overlooking the valley below as a third climber,  (Jack Taylor), calls to them from above. complains to them of a sudden bitter cold and a fog that has abruptly reduced visibility. He calls out to them that someone is coming in his direction, but that he can\u0027t make them out in the fog. He screams and falls past his fellows on the ledge below. Acting quickly they secure his rope and begin to pull him back up. As his motionless blood-stained body comes in view one of them Anthony Parker falls mute, staring in horror at what he sees. He falters, and as the other climber, Jeremy Longhurst, continues to pull against the weight the rope wears thin against the jagged rock face. The body falls unseen down the face of the cliff. Jeremy Longhurst, shouts at Anthony Parker, \"you idiot, we nearly had him.\" Anthony Parker stares frozen and pale, \"Didn\u0027t you see? His head... it was torn off!\"In the valley below a train speeds by through tall fir trees. As it approaches a tunnel mouth the film title races out of the tunnel toward the viewer, \"The Trollenberg Terror (1958),\" in jagged text, as the train plunges into the blackness of the tunnel. Stanley Black\u0027s music crescendos in suspense as the opening credits flash across the screen. The train emerges into daylight at the far end of the tunnel as the credits end.Two attractive young women,  and  (Jennifer Jayne and Janet Munro) on their way to Geneva, nap together in a non-descript cabin car aboard the train as a gentleman,  (Forrest Tucker), seated opposite them reads his newspaper. Anne stirs and Sarah wakes her from her nap, apparently disturbed by a dream she doesn\u0027t quite recall. Sarah directs Anne\u0027s attention to the mountain view outside the train cabin window. As she looks out toward Mount Trollenberg her cheerful smile melts into a seeming trance. She turns away from the window inexplicably shaken by something she has apparently seen and collapses into the arms of Alan Brooks, leading to an awkward introduction.The train\u0027s conductor wanders by, as they converse, announcing the next stop as Trollenberg. Anne announces that they must get off there to her sister\u0027s amazement. More shocking still Anne seems to know the town in great detail, though she has never been there, even naming the Hotel Europa as their destination, seemingly without having any way of knowing the hotel even exists. Sarah protests, but Anne insists, yet still completely unable to explain her knowledge of the town or the reason she feels compelled to stop there. Mr. Brooks retreats into an uncomfortable silence at the oddly tense exchange, as the train rolls into the station.A man enters the Trollenberg train station strolling briskly past scenic tourist wall posters of a lush valley overlooked by snow capped mountains. In the station lobby,  (Frederick Schiller), the proprietor of the Hotel Europa and the Mayor of Trollenberg, introduces himself, as Alan Brooks introduces him to the Pilgrim Sisters, Anne and Sarah. Sarah apologizes for and then thanks Herr Klein for him accommodating them without a reservation at the Europa and Herr Klein becomes uncomfortable with a nervous attempt to explain why his hotel isn\u0027t fully booked during his peak season, On the drive from the train station to the hotel Anne becomes distracted, and begins describing the recent death of the climber on Mt. Trollenberg. She seems to be babbling details she couldn\u0027t possibly know, yet Herr Klein is noticeably shaken by statements she pulls out of thin air. Herr Klein stumbles through a clumsy apology for both the death of the young climber and then an account by Anne of the mountain folk leaving the area in the belief that it is in some way cursed. It is revealed that this recent tragedy is not the first death on the mountain, and that it has become a common occurrence for those who venture there to disappear without a trace.The car approaches the hotel along a picturesque tree lined road. A balcony overlooks an immaculate garden at the front of a quaint gabled chalet with a small mazot outbuilding in the background. The scene is framed by the alps, half shrouded in mist. Amidst the beauty of the scene Alan Brooks and the Pilgrim Sisters exit the car. Anne seems unnerved by Mt. Trollenberg, looming above them in the landscape.Journalist,  (Laurence Payne), sips on his beer and smokes at the small bar as the group enters the hotel lobby.  (Colin Douglas) tends the bar and excuses himself to unload the car as Truscott introduces himself to the group. He seems to recognize the sisters from somewhere, though he is unable for the moment to place them. The sisters retire to their room, and Sarah opens the window on a view of Mt. Trollenberg. Anne looks out upon the scene and once again becomes transfixed, describing details of a hiking shack, and cable car of which she has no prior knowledge, as though looking out on the scene she is able to see features to distant to be visible, in more detail than mere description or memory, but as though she were there. She becomes frustrated with the reasons the mountain seems so familiar to her, electing at Sarah\u0027s suggestion to believe that she must have read about it in a travel brochure, rather than as Anne suspects, that she remembers it from scenes in a dream. Anne gazes out again at the mountain, this time silent but still haunted by her attraction to it and something terrifying that she is unable to recall.Truscott pays Mr. Brooks a visit in his room, exchanging pleasantries and small talk as Brooks unpacks his bags. Truscott\u0027s banal seeming banter gives way to subtle interrogation as Brooks\u0027 answers become more curious to him. As Brooks finishes unpacking his revolver is plainly visible, and Truscott\u0027s curiosity is whetted. Truscott suddenly recalls where he has seen Sarah and Anne before and reveals to Brooks\u0027 amusement that they are performers with a mind-reading act. Truscott, excuses himself to his own room down the hall, but fails to close the door to his room. As Brooks leaves his own room he overhears Truscott on the telephone, requesting that Brooks be checked out. Brooks shrugs it off, but puzzles for a moment. As he enters the lobby his contemplation is broken as he\u0027s greeted by geologist  (Stuart Saunders) and his mountain guide,  (Andrew Faulds) who are finalizing their plans to climb \"The Trollenberg.\"  is intent on finding the reason behind the rash of deaths on the mountain and suspects that some peculiar mineral formation must be the problem, while  remains skeptical. Dewhurst buys a round of drinks for everyone as they wander down from their rooms, all except Anne, who has remained behind to have a quiet nap, Sarah seeming to be of the impression that her sister\u0027s strange behavior is the result of stress and over-work.Truscott admonishes Brett to \"mind his roping,\" and they begin an exchange concerning the terrible and peculiar death of the young climber the previous week. Truscott suggests that the rope had become tangled around the climbers neck, and had decapitated him. Hans reluctantly disagrees, and tells the room that the matter is more mysterious still, that the rope had been tied around the young climber\u0027s waist, and that the villagers did not share the opinion that it had decapitated him, but something else, something evil.As the gathering breaks up, Brooks hitches a ride with Brett and Dewhurst on the cable car on his way to \"The Observatory.\" On the long cable-car ride up the mountain, Dewhurst explains his theory that chemical changes in the mountain rocks could be loosening or cracking them, making climbing the mountain a dangerous enterprise as Brett looks on unconvinced.The cosmic ray observatory is an imposing structure, more like a bunker than an academic facility. Massive, windowless concrete walls taper upward like the battlements of a fortress. The handrails of a long twisting stair can be seen winding up the ragged slope.In the laboratory  (Warren Mitchell) pours over the observatory\u0027s cosmic ray detector and flusters impatiently when interrupted by his assistant,  (Derek Sydney) informing him of a visitor. He greets Brooks at the observatory\u0027s entrance, a heavily reinforced steel door befitting the robust construction of the observatory itself. Even the observatory\u0027s single window is shielded by a huge steel shutter which the professor demonstrates. TV monitors provide the exterior view from a console inside, making the observatory proof against the worst avalanche imaginable.A cryptic conversation ensues between Brooks and the professor concerning the death of the student mountain climber, and many many other similar incidents in which, as the professor explains, no bodies had ever been found. Mysterious disappearances all in the same area of The Trollenberg. Brooks discounts them as the unfortunate but inevitable result of inexperienced climbers underestimating the dangers of the treacherous peak. The professor argues that Mt. Trollenberg has a single small cloud on its south face, which should not be there. Brooks is unimpressed but one senses that there is a hidden significance to the presence of the small cloud, \"where there are mountains there are always clouds,\" Brooks says, almost as though he is trying to convince himself. At least he seems skeptical until the professor reveals that this cloud never moves, and is radioactive. He demonstrates to Brooks using the observatory\u0027s cosmic ray detector, scanning the mountain, and each scan registering high radiation levels as the scanner passes the cloud. Their past association is revealed as the conversation turns to an incident three years prior in the Andes, where a similar pattern emerged. They shroud the nature of the incident as though reluctant to say in plain terms that they suspected a sinister cause. The professor urges Brooks to alert the authorities, but he\u0027s reluctant. The incident in the Andes damaged his credibility and was still an embarrassment to him. If no evidence were found to support him this time, he would look like a fool, and his career would likely end abruptly. Concerned but uncertain of a course of action he hesitates. \"This can\u0027t be the same. There are too many things missing,\" Brooks exclaims, \"mental compulsion...\" He stops in mid-sentence suddenly recalling Anne Pilgrim\u0027s strange attraction to Trollenberg and her odd behavior.Wilde interrupts, shouting across the laboratory room, \"there\u0027s climbers on The Trollenberg!\" His statement alarms Crevett and Brooks and they turn there attention to the climbers immediately. Professor Crevett activates the TV monitors and zooms in on the climbers as they ascend the mountain toward a small cabin. Brooks recognizes the geologist, Dewhurst and his guide, Brett.The professor presses Brooks to act on the situation, but Brooks is still reluctant. \"...I\u0027m not going to stick my neck out again like I did in the Andes,\" he murmurs. \"...they practically accused me of dreaming the whole thing up. If I was to take a hand here, I\u0027d have to have a list of documented facts, and they\u0027d have to be pretty conclusive.\" Brooks appears troubled. He seems to know that Crevett is right, yet his experience in the Andes has made him leery of the repercussions of making their theory public.Dewhurst and Brett arrive at the cabin without incident to the great relief of Brooks. The small cabin is little more than an eight foot by ten foot wooden shack of rough hewn planks set against a landscape of snowy mountain ridges. Brett enters followed by Dewhurst and after stowing his pack on the upper bunk at the back wall, begins a casual examination of the cabin\u0027s facilities, a few small pots and pans, an oil burning portable stove. Brett uses the cabin\u0027s primitive telephone to ring the Hotel Europa to inform Herr Klein of their safe arrival. It seems to reinforce the notion that the accidents have simply been a coincidence caused by a large number of careless climbers. Brooks and Crevett share his relief, but they obviously hold some doubt in reserve.Evening comes as Brett and Dewhurst settle in. Brett busies himself with notes of some kind as Dewhurst dozes in the lower bunk. Brett opens the cabin door and notes that visibility has declined. A small cloud has moved down the mountain and brought with it both thick fog and an intense chill.Meanwhile, in the lobby of the Hotel Europa, the Pilgrim Sisters are entertaining the guests with there mind-reading act. Anne correctly identifies a bank note reading off the serial number without ever seeing the note, to the delight of the onlookers. A second object is introduced. Anne correctly identifies it as a snow globe, describing the scene inside the small glass dome. As she begins to detail the small cabin in the scene, her trance becomes dark and disturbing. She is no longer describing the cabin in the snow globe but the cabin on the slopes of The Trollenberg where Brett and Dewhurst have camped for the night. She describes the two men in the cabin, as Brett himself seems to fall under some sort of trance. He leaves the cabin as if sleep walking, seemingly oblivious to having left the door open he walks off into the distance. Anne describes him coming up the slope and Dewhurst sleeping in the bunk. The guests become alarmed and her sister, Sarah becomes fearful of her sister\u0027s unexplained deviation from their act. Anne collapses as Brooks rushes to the phone. He calls the cabin and wakes Dewhurst. As Dewhurst assures Brooks that everything is quite alright and that Brett must have simply stepped out for a bit of air.Anne awakens in her bed with her sister, Truscott and Prof. Crevett watching over her. Crevett takes Sarah aside and insists that she must take Anne away from the area in the morning. Anne is sedated and left to sleep as the others return to the hotel lobby. Crevett comments to Brooks that in her trance, Anne had described Brett from the perspective not of the cabin, but from outside the cabin, as though observing him from further up the mountain slope.Crevett briefly interrogates Sarah and confirms that Anne is genuinely telepathic. He again insists that Sarah remove Anne from the area first thing in the morning, but is less than candid when she presses him for an explanation. The phone rings in the hotel lobby, and Crevett is called to speak to his assistant, Wilde. He alerts the professor that the strange radioactive cloud has begun to move slowly down the face of The Trollenberg toward the cabin and that its radioactivity has begun to increase. Crevett informs Brooks that the cloud has moved into the vicinity of the cabin and Brooks rushes to the phone. Dewhurst answers and confirms that Brett has not yet returned but that he can\u0027t see far outside do to the heavy fog. It has also become bitterly cold. As they converse he hears something outside the cabin. He checks the door, locking with door with a bar from the inside. However, it looks like the unseen danger has entered the cabin from a back door as Dewhurst begins to scream and Brooks cannot do anything but for listening to the screams in horror. The phone line goes dead leaving all at the Hotel Europa in panic and suspense.Once again the phone rings in the hotel lobby, as Wilde informs the professor that the cloud has begun to move away from the cabin again.Mayor Klein, Brooks, Truscott and several villagers gather just before dawn in the hotel lobby and prepare packs and ropes for a rescue expedition. Herr Klein calls for a search plane, but doesn\u0027t expect that it will arrive until later that morning.Anne stirs restlessly shortly after dawn, tossing in her sleep and muttering. She describes men coming up the mountain to the hut. Crevett and Sarah attempt to calm her. She returns to sleep and Sarah presses the professor once again for an explanation for her sister\u0027s behavior. This time hew does explain in closely guarded words that Anne is sensitive to the mental images that Sarah transmits to her during their act, but that like a radio receiver, her mind is now overwhelmed by the mental images projected by a much stronger mind.On the slopes of The Trollenberg, the rescue party arrives at the cabin. The door bolted from the inside. Herr Klein knocks and calls to the men he is certain must be inside. Brooks breaks the door in and finds the interior of the cabin frozen. Ice crystals glitter on the blankets on the bunks. They find Dewhurst under the bottom bunk, his head mysteriously missing.Sarah serves her sister breakfast in bed as she makes her intentions known that they depart Trollenberg immediately. Anne argues at first but appears to relent when Sarah insists. Sarah excuses herself to the lobby to make the arrangements and Anne once again falls into a trance in her absence. She gazes out the window at The Trollenberg, the small odd cloud clinging close to its face in the distance. She dresses in haste, as though possessed by a purpose.The search party prepares a litter and carries Dewhurst\u0027s body, Truscott discovers the broken phone lines, and Brooks examines them closely. They crumble at his touch crystallized by intense cold.Anne sneaks out of the hotel, leaving Sarah behind. She holds her head with her hands as if fighting off enormous pressure. She gazes up again to the cloud.as the search plane passes overhead. She heads off in the direction of the mountain.Two members of the search party  (Richard Golding) and  (George Herbert), greet the approaching search plane with a portable radio. They exchange map coordinates with the  (Garard Green) and begin their search for Brett.Sarah returns to the hotel room to find Anne missing along with her coat. As she searches for her out the window the cable car passes in the distance. Sarah rushes from the room to catch her as Anne stands in the cable car, her gaze locked ahead at The Trollenberg. Sarah rushes to the phone to alert the professor at the observatory that her sister is on her way up in the cable car.The search plane circles high above the slopes and the pilot radios the search party that he has sighted Brett, waving below. He reports Brett\u0027s position and heads off into the distance.Wilde meets Anne at the cable car platform and escorts her there under weak protest. (Richard Golding) and  (George Herbert) head to Brett\u0027s location and find his pack, but Brett himself doesn\u0027t seem to be around. As they examine the contents of the pack they find Dewhurst\u0027s severed head. Brett appears suddenly with a look of crazed homicidal lust in his eyes, wielding a climbing pick he attacks them, killing each of them in turn.The professor and Wilde busy themselves with measurements at the observatory as Anne sits quietly. She rises unnoticed and slips past them, sneaking to the massive steel entrance door. On opening the door however she is met by Brooks, Hans, Truscott and the returning members of the search party. She attempts to leave, but Brooks prevents her.Later back at the Hotel Europa, after returning Anne to her bed, Brooks and Professor Crevett discuss the strange radioactive cloud. Truscott interupts, and during the conversation that ensues reveals himself to be a journalist, investigating the mysterious deaths and disappearances. He also knows something of the incident in the Andes.   He confronts them both about stories that they had attributed the strange events in the Andes to alien creatures. Brooks himself then reveals that his role in his position at the UN is part of a special taskforce to investigate possible alien invasions.Brett to everyone\u0027s amazement, wanders in as though nothing has happened. No longer crazed, but seems exhausted and complains that the temperature is too hot. Weak and uncoordinated his motor skills terribly damaged somehow, he attempts to pour himself a drink and spills brandy all over the bar. Anne wanders down from her room, and at the sight of her Brett resumes his crazed state, drawing a knife from his belt and lunges for her. Brooks punches him soundly and sends him spinning backward. His head strikes a bronze statue of a wolf, howling which gashes his head deeply. He collapses to the floor, but to the shock of Truscott and Sarah, the wound doesn\u0027t bleed. Brett is carried into the wine cellar where Professor Crevett stitches his forehead. They leave, locking him in the wine cellar while they discuss informing the UN of the situation and Brett\u0027s zombie like condition.Brett awakens and hides against the wine cellar door as Mayor Klein approaches. Herr Klein peers in through the small window in the door and Brett grabs him by the neck, killing him and retrieving the mayor\u0027s keys from his pocket. Hearing the commotion, Sarah stirs from her sleep and goes to investigate. Brett finds a large clever in the kitchen and shuffles toward the stairway to the bedrooms on the upper floor just as Sarah reaches the top of the stair and sees him, alerting Alan Brooks. Brett enters the sister\u0027s room as Sarah pounds on Brook\u0027s door in panic.   Brooks appears behind Brett in the doorway as Anne awakens, Brett standing over her bed with the clever raised to strike. Anne screams as a single shot rings out and Brett falls to the floor, Brooks standing in the doorway, revolver in hand.Crevett and Brooks begin an examination of Brett\u0027s body noting a peculiar cast to his skin. Crevett instructs Hans to hold his oil lamp lower to allow a better view and as he does so the flesh of Brett\u0027s arm seems to vaporize, leaving only skeletal remains. Truscott bursts into the room and announces that the observatory has phoned to tell them that the radioactive cloud has begun to move down the mountain again, this time directly toward the village.Brooks decides that they should all head for the observatory due to the heavily fortified structure, but Hans panics and speeds off toward the valley straight into the path of the oncoming cloud. Brooks gathers the party and a number of villagers together and they head off to the cable car. As they leave, a  (Caroline Glaser) drops her toy ball in the hotel lobby.From the platform they watch the cloud pour down from The Trollenberg into the village below. It stops in front of the hotel. The toy ball lies on the floor in the middle of the lobby as wisps of frosty mist can be seen under the lobby door.The cable car arrives at the platform and as they party rushes to the car, a  (Anne Sharp) realizes her daughter is nowhere to be found. Brooks instructs Truscott to leave him behind if he doesn\u0027t return before the cloud heads toward them, and he heads back down toward the village and the hotel in search of the child.In the hotel lobby, the doors begin to shake and finally break inward revealing the horror outside. A massive bulbous creature with long sinuous tentacles and a single enormous eye presses against the frame of the door, peering and reaching about inside the lobby with its tentacles. The young girl enters the lobby from the side entrance unaware of the danger lurking a few meters away and retrieves her toy ball. The alien seizes her with a tentacle as Alan Brooks bursts in through the window pick-axe in hand. He severs the tentacle holding her and rushes her away as the alien wails in pain. They return to the cable car and begin the ascent to the observatory as mist begins to filter onto the cable car platform below. Frost begins to form on the cable car pulley and the cable car lurches violently as the mechanism begins to freeze. The cable car arrives at the observatory platform and Brooks rushes the passengers out, fearing the cable could snap at any moment.The thick steel door of the observatory opens and Wilde ushers the party inside, rushing Brooks and Truscott to the main laboratory while the villagers huddle in the entry hall. In the laboratory Crevett informs them that the cloud has broken up into separate clouds, four, then five, all moving toward the observatory.On the video monitor Hans appears at the door. Wilde goes to let him in and asks him what happened. Hans explains that he ran into the cloud on the road and turned around. He seems mildly confused and disoriented and complains that the room is too hot, grasping at the collar of his sweater. They leave Hans in the entry hall and return to the lab. Hans peers around the corner and meets Anne\u0027s gaze. A crazed look comes over him as Anne retreats quietly to the professor\u0027s office at the rear of the lab. (Theodore Wilhelm) the professor\u0027s other assistant sits at a large console and alerts the professor of a sudden drop in temperature on the platform outside. Brooks begins to puzzle out the need for cold by the creatures as well as those who have come under their control. He mentions that Brett complained of the heat in the hotel before attempting to kill Anne, and Wilde interupts that Hans also complained on the heat upon his unexpected return. The party rushes to locate Hans and find him in the office, his large hands wrapped tightly around Anne\u0027s neck. Truscott leaps onto Han\u0027s back and pries him off of her as Brooks enters the office. The two struggle with Hans as Anne lies motionless on the professor\u0027s desk. Finally Brooks stabs Hans with a letter opener and he collapses.In the lab Brooks orders an airstrike of firebombs to be dropped on the observatory, in the hope that the thick concrete structure will resist the intense heat. The party begins constructing improvised malatov cocktails as the mist begins to gather outside. The hideous aliens can be seen outside creeping slowly up the rocky slope toward the observatory.The professor calls Brooks to the video console as the aliens make their appearance. Brooks grabs one of the molotov cocktails and steps outside. Launching it at one of the creatures as it sheiks in a high pitched unearthly tone. Truscott follows suit and is grabbed from above by an alien tentacle. As he dangles above the ground Brooks launches another of the homemade incendiaries up toward the roof of the observatory. Truscott falls to the ground and the creature retreats with a piercing wail. Brooks and Truscott rush inside and seal the door.As the creatures freeze the cameras, rendering them blind, the UN airstike arrives and contacts the observatory for instructions.Sarah tends her still unconscious sister in the office as one of the creatures lurks outside the heavy wall. Behind them the wall begins to crack from the intense cold and a door sized chunk of concrete falls inward revealing the creature outside, tentacles waving trough the opening, grasping for Sarah and Anne. Brooks rushes in at the commotion, heedless of the danger in an attempt to rescue them from the clutches of the alien and is caught by a tentacle. Truscott follows ushering Sarah and Anne to the relative safety of the main lab as Brooks struggles.   Truscott rushes to the lab and returns with another maltov cocktail which he hurls through the opening and Brooks frees himself from its grasp. They hasten to the lab and close the door.Hugo (uncredited role), another of the professors assistants, monitors the communications station and alerts Brooks to the approach of the fighter plane. He instructs the pilot to bomb the cloud covering the observatory.Overhead, \"Jolly Rodger\" squares his fighter plane up for his first pass and begins dropping his fire bombs.   They frame the building in flames as they strike the roof and surround the building. The aliens shriek and lash about with their tentacles. He returns for a second pass and the creatures are engulfed in flame, blackening and crisping. The wailing subsides as the creatures perish in the flames.The building\u0027s once pristine exterior is piled with the blackened remains of the immense alien bodies, smoking in ruin, but still distinct enough in form to provide Alan Brooks and Professor Crevett with the validation of their theory. Disaster averted the townfolk have been saved from gruesome death and the Earth from alien invasion.The steel window shutter slides up, permitting sunlight into the lab once again, the smoking husk of an alien poised on the roof above it. From inside the lab the view of The Trollenberg is once again visible. Anne and Truscott scamper out the steel door together as if, suddenly relieved of the terror they have found a romantic interest in each other, as Brooks and Sarah remark in jest on whether Anne will be safe in his company. The sky is clear and the party rejoices. Crevett observes that for the first time in three years, The Trollenberg is free of clouds, and Brooks expresses his hope that it stays that way.The Trollenberg stands majestically in the background...The closing credits role.","numvotes":"4161","primarytitle":"The Crawling Eye"},"color":"rgb(119,86,100)","size":1.0},{"source":"body in art","target":"tt0323808","id":"6617","attributes":{"productioncompany":"British Lion Film Corporation","countriesoforigin":"United Kingdom","averagerating":"3.8","titletype":"movie","notes":"Folk horror","originaltitle":"The Wicker Tree","storyline":"Young Christians Beth and Steve, a gospel singer and her cowboy boyfriend, leave Texas to preach door-to-door in Scotland .

They pass Tressock Nuclear Power station where they meet Sir Lachlan and travel on to the village. A lady rides up on a horse, they stop \u0026 have a brief chat about a special feast on Sunday and the horse. Villages wait slightly out of sight as they enter the village and drive through. They stop and we are introduced to Jack and his pet bird, he talks jibberish to them and the bird says Nevermore. Steve is puzzled, it is clear that Beth has been whisked off and Sir Lachlan explains that they will be spilt up with Beth staying at the manor and Steve staying in a tavern. He is introduced to the owner and off he goes.Lolly, who we now know was the horse rider, and a policeman go into his station/ house and begin to flirt \u0026 undress. A car pulls up at a large manor house and out steps Sir Lachlan \u0026 Beth. Back to Steve at pub, he is talking with Jack \u0026 some other locals.

Afterwards they talk on the bank of the river, He gets up, dressed and realises he has lost his silver ring in the water.Then we see Sir Lachlan and some others in a meeting about living near their Nuclear Power Station this continues outside in car where it is hinted at a Nuclear accident infiltrating the water and all are now infertile, so no babies. Beth \u0026 Steve are in the church preaching to Sir Lachlan and the villagers, Beth begins to sing as Steve passes out pamphlets as the song carries on the villagers begin to join in. Outside is a buffet spread where we see Jack and his bird (Raven), Lolly comes up to him and they chat, she then goes to the church window watching Steve as he walks through the villagers. After this they are taken across the river in a boat to a lodge, and left alone. Steve doesn\u0027t talk, Beth becomes concerned and asks whats wrong. He basically says that he will be there for the May Queen crowning the next day, but he is leaving after and returning to Texas as he is a sinner. He goes off with Sir Lachlan to practice what to do next day as Laddie, Sir Lachlan is walking through the woods with Steve telling him what to do, not to listen to anything anyone says and get to a castle ruin where there is a throne he must sit on and wait for everyone else to arrive. Beth is upset at the lodge and begins to listen to her old raunchier song, but then slams it off and regains composure. Back at the tavern Steve is asked for his autogragh by a young boy, Steve mentions there are no other children around and asks why, however the Landlord comes out and tells the boy to get off home and stop bothering Steve. At the Manor Beth is dressed up in a glamourous formal evening dress as tells Delia she\u0027s mad with Steve and plans to enjoy herself. Then montage of Steve looking sorry for himself and Beth at the dinner party dancing with someone in a kilt. Then the evening party are singing around the piano, later on Beth is ready for bed in her room saying her prayers, there is a knock at the door and it is the butler (Beame) bringing her some hot milk. There is a cat in her room which Beame tries to chase out but Beth insists it stays. Beth goes to sleep and the cat drinks \u0026 knocks over milk. Then cut to the policeman \u0026 Lolly having sex again, Jack and another villager stand outside laughing at the noise and we cut to an ambulance rushing off. The next morning the cat is dead on the floor when Delia enters, Beth is asleep. Delia picks up the cat and takes it downstairs to Lachlan and shows him the dead cat. Beame is told to deal with Beth after breaksfast and get her ready. Delia \u0026 Lachlan talk about their religious beliefs, he looks at a portait on the wall and we are shown a flashback of him and his Grandfather (Christopher Lee) by the river talking about the Laddie and fate. Delia and Lachlan finish talking and the hunt for the Laddie begins. Beame (wearing traditional kilt) is climbing the stairs carrying a needle, he enters Beths room, but she wakes up as he approaches, she see the needle and struggles picking up some of the broken glass and stabbing in his testicles, he yells and she runs away knocking over the cook, through the house and outside. The hunt continues while Beame is having his injury seen to by the cook and they discuss where she\u0027d go. The hunt is still going and Steve is making good headway until his stirrup breaks (having been cut) making him fall from the horse. He gets up and begins to ride away, but Lolly has caught up and is calling to him. We see Beth running down a deserted road where she comes across Jack. She goes into his house and tries to use the phone but he is too incoherrent to help her. Suddenly Beame walks in, grabs her and takes her away. Lolly tels Steve it\u0027s a trap and to follow her, but he thinks it\u0027s just a so he ignores her. Steve arrives at the Castle just as the others are catching up. Beth is laid out face down, unconcious and naked on the kitchen table being brushed with oil by Cook. Beame, the cook and another villager (Mary?) talk amongst themselves about Beth and why she is being brushed in oil as the conversation carries on it is apparent that Sir Lachlan intends to eat her raw. Cook says she is sedated as Lachlan like them to be fresh as possible, then Beame gets upset as somebody has been messing with his collection of May Queen eyes. Steve is just getting to the castle, and Beth is being put in a store room still unconcious on a table. She begins to wake up and looks around. In the meantime Lanchlan and the other villagers enter the Castle where Steve is sitting on the throne as he was told. Steve is cocky at first, but starts to lose his bravado as the villagers surround the throne. As this is going on Beth puts on the May Queen dress and explores her surroundings. Lachlan begins to talk as the villagers start to strip off. Beth sees what appears to be statues of previous May Queens, but it starts to become apparent to her that they are not what they seem and she calls out. Lachlan and the villagers start to sing as the continue to strip in front of a confused Steve who doesn\u0027t seem to realise what is going on, suddenly realisation dawns as Lachlan begins to give praise to the Sun as the villagers descend. It is too late as the villagers grab Steve and begin to eat him alive, Lolly is outside sobbing and we see the villagers dancing and feasting in praise.As Beth looks at the statues, the Cook is listening to the radio and rather drunk, you can hear Beth calling and banging to be let out. Delia is seen after bathing Steves blood off and hears Beth yelling. Beth touches a statue and the outside cracks away revealing a skeletal hand underneath, she runs for a door that leads her outside, it\u0027s locked but she manages to escape through a window. She runs and bumps into Lolly, who tells her Steve is dead, Beth can\u0027t beleive it and Lolly tries to get her to go away with her she refuses even though Lolly makes it clear to her that she will be killed. Beth walks on up a hill to where the Wicker Tree stands, Lachlan is singing as the villagers dance around in praise. Beth walks through them and them seem not to see her and suddenly Lachlan is made aware that the Queen is there, he looks surprised but begins to explain when she asks about Steve. She asks Danny (a villager) who confirms he is dead, very quickly as Lachlan continues to talk Beth shoves him into the Wicker Tree where he burns alive. She tells the villagers to sing, they join in and then disperse back to the village. Beth is left alone and trying to find a way out of the village when she comes across the little boy who offers to lead to the next village. As they walk, the villagers start to appear behind her. She is suddenly grabbed by them. Lolly gives birth to a baby, they proclaim as their little cowboy.The end shot is of Beth in full May Queen regalia - despite her efforts she has suffered the same fate as the other May Queens before her.","numvotes":"2672","primarytitle":"The Wicker Tree"},"color":"rgb(92,73,83)","size":2.0},{"source":"Drama","target":"tt0804507","id":"7082","attributes":{"notes":"Art school as context.

Inside the box they discover artifacts belonging to Mater Lachrymarum (Moran Atias), the last surviving member of the Three Mothers; an ancient trio of powerful black witches. In particular, the box contains a magic cloak that, when worn by Mater Lachrymarum, increases her powers significantly.The urn is shipped to the Museum of Ancient Art in Rome, where Sarah Mandy (Asia Argento), an Italian-American studying art restoration works. Sarah is dating the curator Michael Pierce (Adam James), a single father who is away from the museum that night. With help from the assistant curator Giselle (Coralina Cataldi-Tassoni), Sarah opens the box and finds the cloak, a dagger, and three statues representing the three witches. Sending Sarah to her office to retrieve tools to help her translate the text on the artifacts, Giselle is promptly attacked by the demonic agents of Mater Lachrymarum. Sarah arrives too late to save Giselle (who is being disembowelled by the monsters) and starts to flee the museum. Unfortunately, she is pursued by Mater Lachrymarum\u0027s familiar (a baboon) and is only able to escape when a disembodied voice magically throws open a series of locked doors keeping her trapped inside the museum. Sarah tells the police what happened as she spends the night with Michael and his son. Michael visits the Cardinal who sent him the urn only to find out that, shortly after mailing the urn to him, he had a severe stroke and is now in a coma. An assistant of the priest gives Michael a piece of paper, which the Cardinal was writing on before collapsing. On it is scrawled the name \"Mater Lachrymarum\". As he leaves the hospital, a pair of witches observe Michael leaving the building.Back in Rome, chaos descends as a wave of mass suicides, murder, and violence engulfs the city. Sarah continues her own research only to be summoned by Michael to his apartment. The witches have kidnapped his young son and won\u0027t return the boy to him unless he stops his investigation. Sarah begs him to call the police (who are tailing Sarah, ever since the murder at the museum) but Michael refuses to and instead opts to visit a local priest (Udo Kier) who is a trained exorcist. This goes badly for Michael; the two witches see him and he is soon captured and murdered, along with his son, whose body is cannibalized by the rapidly-expanding coven. However, before he is killed, Michael calls Sarah and begs for her to come and help him.As Sarah makes her way through a crowded train station, Sarah is spotted by a gang of witches who, like so many other witches, have arrived in Rome from all over the world in order to pledge their loyalty to Mater Lachrymarum. Pursued by the witches and the police, the disembodied voice from before instructs Sarah on how to magically make herself invisible. She uses this to avoid the police detective, though she is forced to kill a Japanese witch (Jun Ichikawa) who catches and corners her on the train.At the priest\u0027s home, Sarah meets Marta (Valeria Cavalli), a fellow white witch and friend of Sarah\u0027s deceased mother Elisa (Daria Nicolodi). Realizing that Sarah\u0027s mother is the voice guiding her, Marta reveals details to Sarah about her parents. Her mother was a powerful white witch who dared to challenge and severely wound Mater Suspiriorum, the eldest and wisest of the Three Mothers (a reference to \u0027Suspria\u0027). In response to this, Suspiriorum (known by her alias as Elena Markos) caused the fatal car crash that killed Sarah\u0027s parents. Though Mater Suspiriorum and her sister Mater Tenebrarum are now dead, their sibling Mater Lachrymarum has emerged from the shadows to bring about the second age of magic, with the fall of Rome as her coming out party. They talk to the priest, only for him to be killed before he can give the two a copy of a book that would explain Mater Lachrymarum\u0027s backstory to them by a patient of his.Escaping back to the city, Sarah goes to her own home but finds Mater Lachrymarum\u0027s goons waiting for her. She heads to Marta\u0027s house, but once again Mater Lachrymarum\u0027s minions strike and Marta and her lesbian lover are murdered. Fleeing, Sarah spots Michael, who takes her back to his apartment. Unfortunately, Sarah soon realizes that Michael is dead and that Mater Lachrymarum is animating his body in an attempt to kill her. As she burns her lover\u0027s still-animate body, the ghost of her mother intervenes one final time to grab Michael and banish him (and possibly herself) to Hell.Out of options, Sarah locates a powerful alchemist, who Marta mentioned as her only hope to learn how to fight Mater Lachrymarum. After being briefly paralyzed by the alchemist (so that he could perform a test on her to see if she was a white witch or an evil witch), the alchemist gives Sarah the only help he has in locating Mater Lachrymarum\u0027s dwelling. Sarah is given a copy of \"The Three Mothers\" to read (a reference to the previous movie \u0027Inferno\u0027), and from this (and from following a group of witches) Sarah finds Mater Lachrymarum\u0027s lair; a now run-down and disrepaired mansion.At this point, Sarah is joined by one of the police detectives hunting (whom think she has something to do with the recent murders in Rome) her and the two go into the catacombs under the house to find Mater Lachrymarum. However, the two become separated, and the detective is tortured alongside the alchemist and his assistant, who dies after his arm is chopped off by one of Mater Lachrymarum\u0027s minions. Sarah is caught and brought before Mater Lachrymarum, who offers Sarah up to her cannibal followers but makes the mistake of removing her cloak. Sarah, having healed the detective\u0027s wounds, grabs the cloak and tosses it into a nearby fire. This causes the mansion to collapse as a pillar falls and impales Mater Lachrymarum. With the Mother\u0027s followers crushed as the caves collapses, Sarah and the detective manage to escape from the catacombs and as they reach the surface, the both laugh in horror and shock, as they realize that the threat of the Three Mothers has been defeated once and for all.","numvotes":"10094","primarytitle":"Mother of Tears","productioncompany":"Medusa Film","countriesoforigin":"Italy, United States","averagerating":"5.0","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"La terza madre","storyline":"An ancient urn is found in a cemetery outside Rome.

It is revealed that Jewish, Muslim, and Christian priests were all called to perform an exorcism on a woman who supposedly died three days before. Her son claims she was calm at first, but became violent later, injuring her husband. After failed attempts to cure her, the priests decide they have no choice but to kill the woman. In a final attempt, the woman screams while sprouting leather wings, just before a priest kills her with a derringer.In the present day, two Jewish Americans, Rachel Klein (Yael Grobglas) and Sarah Pullman (Danielle Jadelyn), plan a trip to Tel Aviv, Israel. On the plane they meet student Kevin Reed (Yon Tumarkin). Kevin is fascinated by religious mythology (especially the dark angel, the Golem and the undead or zombies). He suggests that Rachel and Sarah join him on his journey to Jerusalem, and mentions that he wants to spend Yom Kippur there. Sarah becomes infatuated with Kevin and convinces her friend to go to Jerusalem.On their way, to the hotel they meet a local who believes that he is King David. The local warns them to leave the city because it\u0027s dangerous, but the friends believe he is insane. In the hotel they meet Omar (Tom Grazian), a local Palistinenan. While Rachel starts an affair with Omar, Kevin and Sarah grow closer. The four friends enjoy their time in Jerusalem, party, and tour the city.When they visit the Western Wall, Sarah wishes for her recently dead brother Joel to return.

Confederate troops led by a man named Jasper (Jack Huston) bring in a few runaway slaves. One of them, Amara (Achok Majak), runs away again in terror after watching the other men strap a device to another slave, Eli (Tongayi Chirisa). Jasper chases after Amara on horseback and brings her down by lassoing a noose around her neck. She begs to be killed instead of returned to the antebellum, and Jasper obliges her by shooting her in the head.One of the captured women, Eden (Janelle Monae), is brought into the home of her owner, a Confederate general known only as \"Him\" (Eric Lange). He beats Eden and orders her to say her name. When she cannot, Him grabs a branding iron and burns it into her back, causing her to scream in agony before weakly crying out her name.Six weeks later, a new group of black people are brought in to the plantation. Jasper orders the group to not speak unless they are given permission. Jasper\u0027s wife Elizabeth (Jena Malone) brings her daughter (Arabella Landrum) to pick one of the women in the group, whom the little girl names Julia (Kiersey Clemons). When Eden takes Julia with her, she asks Eden where they are and what is happening, but Eden tells her to keep quiet.Eli goes to Eden\u0027s house later to ask when they can escape again, but Eden appears to have given up hope. She walks carefully across the floor to see which boards do not make noises when stepped on. Julia then goes to her home, where she seems to already know who Eden really is. She wants to try and escape as well, as she is pregnant, but Eden shows her the branding scar to show that it is better not to anger the people in charge. Julia expresses disappointment in Eden, saying she is not a leader.The slaves are forced to work during a gathering of Him and his troops, where he boasts about preserving their way of life for the future. Two young soldiers, Purcell (T.C. Matherne) and Daniel (Robert Aramayo), observe Julia, and Daniel expresses attraction toward her. Purcell encourages him to speak to her, and Jasper comes in and orders Julia to wait in Daniel\u0027s cabin. When Daniel goes to find her later, Julia tries to appeal to what she thinks is his innocent nature since he appeared to be kinder than the other men, but he proves to be just as terrible when he strikes Julia for speaking to him without permission. He kicks her in the stomach before leaving.The next day on the plantation, Julia suffers a miscarriage. She cries out in pain and distress, and Eden goes to help her. Jasper attempts to antagonize them, but Eli keeps him back briefly by calling him a cracker. After letting Eden help Julia, Jasper confronts Eli over the matter, with the other soldiers getting ready to fire if they need to, but he instead sends Eli to clean out the shed. There, he finds the burnt remains of Amara, which he recognizes from her cross necklace. Eli breaks down.That night, Eden tries to sleep. She starts to hear what sounds like a cell phone ringing. She then appears to wake up from what seemed like a bad dream. Here, Eden is revealed to be an author and activist named Veronica Henley, married to Nick (Marque Richardson) with a daughter, Kennedi (London Boyce), all of whom live in present day Atlanta, Georgia. Veronica is well noted for speaking out against the treatment of black Americans, causing her to butt heads with pundits. As she is preparing for an upcoming trip, she sits to have a video conference with another woman... and it\u0027s Elizabeth. She uses condescendingly racist dialogue while discussing Veronica\u0027s book and its themes. Elizabeth also describes herself as a \"talent scout\" while noticing Kennedi, which makes Veronica uncomfortable.After going off on her trip, Veronica meets up with one of her best friends, Dawn (Gabourey Sidibe), as she visits Veronica\u0027s hotel room. She expresses to Dawn some of her frustrations and insecurities with her home life. After Dawn leaves, a mysterious man arrives to bring Veronica flowers but won\u0027t say who they are from. Based on the note that\u0027s left, she assumes they\u0027re from Nick.Veronica steps out of her room and runs into her other close friend Sarah (Lily Cowles), who is joining her and Dawn later that night for dinner and drinks. Meanwhile, Elizabeth sneaks into Veronica\u0027s room, tries on her lipstick, and walks around the room to observe before turning the tag on her door so she won\u0027t get turn-down service. Veronica then attends a conference where she speaks before an audience of black women, all of whom are moved and inspired by her words. As she goes back up to her room, the girl that appeared to be Elizabeth\u0027s daughter is in the elevator with her and creepily tells her she shouldn\u0027t speak unless given permission, but Veronica thinks it\u0027s just a game.Veronica later joins Dawn and Sarah. On the ride to the restaurant, Veronica talks to Nick and thanks him for the flowers, but he says it must have been a fan. Dawn is abrasive toward the staff since she demands the best table and wine. During the night, an unseen man (implied to be Jasper) watches the women all night until he sends a vodka cranberry to Dawn. He then approaches her personally to compliment her, and while flattered, she takes the time to critique his attempt, since she thinks that drink pales in comparison to the wine they are celebrating with, but she gives the man her number just in case. The ladies then prepare to part ways, with Veronica heading into an Uber. Midway through the trip, Veronica gets a call from a woman who says she is her driver waiting outside the restaurant, but she thinks there\u0027s a mistake. Veronica then looks at the driver to see that it\u0027s Elizabeth. Jasper then appears from behind her to grab her. Veronica struggles to break free, but he ultimately knocks her out.Veronica wakes up back on the plantation, where she is still hearing the phone ring. Outside, Him - actually Senator Blake Denton - answers the phone and speaks to someone over how Nick has been all over the news with Kennedi searching for Veronica, and he promises to take care of it. Veronica pretends to be asleep while Denton says he won\u0027t let anyone take her away from him.The next day, Veronica finds that Julia has hung herself. In her despair, she decides that tonight will be the night that they escape. She waits until Denton has fallen asleep, and she manages to sneak outside quietly. Eli finds her and helps her get the cell phone to call for help. They try to make it to the cabin to get a signal, but Purcell and Daniel are out after drinking, forcing the other two to hide and drop the phone. Daniel picks it up, and after Purcell leaves, he stops to urinate. Eli cracks him in the face and leaves Daniel to choke on his blood while they get the phone. They try to make it to the cabin, but Denton attacks the two of them. A fight ensues with Eli hitting Denton to keep him off Veronica, but Denton kills Eli with a hatchet. Veronica hits Denton with a tea kettle before getting his phone. Denton steps out but Veronica stabs him in the gut with a bayonet. She unlocks his phone and manages to call Nick and let him know she is alive, and she sends him a location pin to give to the police. Veronica then goes to Eli\u0027s body and addresses him by his real name, Professor Tarasai.Veronica rolls Denton into a confederate flag and brings him to the shed. He weakly tells her that there will still be more like them, but she scoffs at him. As she goes to get a torch, Jasper finds her, but she tells him that Denton is hurt. Jasper and another guard run into the shed, where Veronica locks them in there and sets the logs on fire to burn all three of them to death. She then rides on horseback as the other soldiers give chase through the woods. After losing most of them, Elizabeth pursues Veronica on her horse. She taunts Veronica and states that Denton (who was really her father) personally picked Veronica because she went against his whole campaign and agenda, while Elizabeth picked everyone else herself. Veronica lassos a noose around Elizabeth\u0027s neck, but Elizabeth slashes at Veronica multiple times until Veronica gains the upper hand and beats Elizabeth\u0027s face. Veronica then rides the horse while pulling Elizabeth until she slams her head against a statue, breaking her neck.Veronica continues to ride as the sun rises and the soldiers continue their re-enacting. She rides outside the gates of the plantation, where it\u0027s revealed that Antebellum is a Civil War re-enactment park. Veronica rides out on her horse to find other people, just as the police arrive, and she appears relieved. The police and feds rescue the kidnapped black people and bulldoze Antebellum to the ground.","numvotes":"25050","primarytitle":"Antebellum"},"color":"rgb(92,73,83)","size":1.0},{"source":"Horror Only","target":"tt0096340","id":"7140","attributes":{"productioncompany":"Vestron Pictures","countriesoforigin":"United States, United Kingdom","averagerating":"5.0","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"The Unholy","storyline":"In New Orleans, a series of horrific murders of priests are occurring around the city\u0027s Catholic churches.

When he offers Claude a cigarette, Michael is pulled out the window and falls to the ground. Inexplicably, he survives the fall without injury. After the incident, Michael is appointed to the St. Agnes parish by the Archbishop Mosely; the parish had been closed after Father Dennis\u0027s unsolved murder.Upon moving into the rectory, Michael is notified by Lieutenant Stern that another priest was murdered there before Father Dennis. Michael finds mention of Millie, a waitress at the Threshold, a local black magic performance art club, in Dennis\u0027s journal; Michael goes to visit her, but she is evasive. She later comes to the parish, claiming to Michael that she saw Father Dennis for confession before his death; during the confession, she admitted to giving her soul to Luke, the owner of the club, whom she claims is the Devil incarnate. Luke visits Michael shortly after, claiming that the Satanic shows put on at the club are only gimmicks, and that he does not actually believe in them; however, he says he\u0027s been recently experiencing supernatural phenomena and begs for Michael\u0027s help. Michael agrees to spend an evening in Luke\u0027s apartment, where he witnesses furious poltergeist activity.When Michael brings the information to Archbishop Mosely, he is informed that Father Dennis was approached by Millie and Luke in an identical manner before being murdered.

His brother, Jason (Mike Vogel), and his girlfriend, Lily (Jessica Lucas) throw a surprise going-away party for him. Rob\u0027s best friend, Hud (T.J. Miller) is recruited to videotape the event but spends much of his time trying to hit on Marlena (Lizzy Caplan). Rob is uncomfortable when Beth (Odette Yustman) brings a date to the party. Rob and Beth have been friends for a long time and had recently had an affair; their date to Coney Island was recorded on the videotape that Hud is now using to record the party. Rob ended the affair abruptly when he got the job. At the party, he insults Beth, who storms out.Jason and Hud take Rob aside to lecture him about his boorish behavior and encourage him to never let go of those he loves most. Just then, a shock jolts their apartment building. The party rushes to the roof to see what is going on. In the distance they see an explosion and must flee back inside the building to avoid debris. Once they move down to the street, Hud continues to shoot video and captures the image of a monstrous shadow moving down the street several blocks away. The monster knocks over the Woolworth Building, sending a cloud of debris billowing down the street. As everyone decides to evacuate Manhattan by going over the Brooklyn Bridge, Marlena informs Lily that she saw smaller creatures attacking and eating people.As they attempt to cross the bridge, Rob receives a call from Beth. She is at her apartment in the Time Warner Center and apparently injured. Jason becomes separated from the others. As they try to make their way to him, the monster\u0027s tail appears out of the gloom and destroys the bridge. Jason is killed but Rob, Hud, Lily, and Marlena make it to safety. In an electronics store, Hud sees footage of the monster shedding parasite creatures from its back that in turn attack people on the street. Rob decides to rescue Beth, even though it means he will have to avoid the monster. Lily, Hud and Marlena agree to go with him. As they move uptown, the heavily armed military appears to fight the monster as it smashes through buildings just ahead of them.The four take refuge in a subway tunnel and decide to walk the tracks to the Warner Center. In the darkened tunnel, they see scurrying rats and hear unsettling noises. Using the night vision function on the camera, they see the scale creatures crawling along the walls. They try to run but the monsters attack; one bites Marlena. The four barricade themselves in a breakroom. After tending Marlena\u0027s wounds and waiting for the creatures to leave, they walk up into a subway station just outside Bloomingdale\u0027s.The military is using Bloomingdale\u0027s as headquarters. Rob pleads for help in finding Beth. Suddenly, Marlena begins bleeding from her eyes and mouth; shortly thereafter her abdomen explodes. A sympathetic soldier tells the others where they should bring Beth if they rescue her -- the last helicopters leave within the hour as the government has determined the only option for controlling the monster is the carpet bombing Manhattan. When they arrive at Beth\u0027s apartment building, they learn that it as collapsed onto the tower opposite it. Making their way up the standing tower, they then crawl into the collapsed tower and rescue Beth.Rob, Hud, Lily and Beth make it to a helipad as a battle rages against the monster all around them. Lily is pushed into one helicopter and the others into the last. Although an aerial bombardment seems to knock the monster over, it suddenly reaches up out of the debris and strikes their helicopter. It crashes into Central Park. The monster sneaks up on them and bites Hud in half. Rob and Beth grab the camera and take shelter under a foot bridge. They record their final goodbyes on the camera as the bridge collapses around them under the air force\u0027s assault.Epilogue. The military has found the tape several days later. Its final moment is from the trip Rob and Beth took to Coney Island. In it, an object can be seen falling from the sky into the ocean, unknown to Rob or Beth.*The following is all from the POV of Hud\u0027s video camera.The movie starts off with Rob videotaping the start of a typical New York day from an apartment in the North Tower of the Time Warner Center. He goes into the bedroom and chats with Beth, whom he has just slept with. The two agree to go to Coney Island for the day.The tape cuts to Rob\u0027s brother, Jason, as he attempts to get the same camera working. His girlfriend Lily tasks him with documenting Rob\u0027s going away party, and Jason passes the task on to his and Rob\u0027s friend Hudson (Hud). Hud obliges, and takes the camera and begins filming the party.During the party, Beth arrives with a date, much to the disappointment of Rob. The two argue, and when Hud asks Lily why, she reluctantly tells him and Jason about Rob and Beth sleeping together. Hud proceeds to tell a number of guests, and Beth leaves. Rob frustrates her even more by wishing \"luck\" to Beth\u0027s date as they leave.Shortly afterwards, the ground shakes and loud roars are heard in the area. The guests of the party go to the roof and look downtown, and see a large explosion in the vicinity. Flaming debris flies towards the roof, and the guests run downstairs and begin to pile into the street. There is another roar and the head of the Statue of Liberty flies through the streets, landing near Hud. Hud walks over to it, then finds Rob, Jason and Lily and the four watch as the Woolworth Building suddenly collapses. They run into a shop to escape the debris. Minutes later, they exit the shop, and find their friend Marlena - whom Hud has a crush on - babbling about \"it\" \"eating people\".After discussing what they saw and concluding that a giant creature is roaming the city, the five friends decide to make to leave the island. They are cut off, however, when the monster destroys the Brooklyn Bridge, killing Jason in the process. They run back into the city and go into an electronics store so that Rob can try and find a battery for his mobile phone. He finds one and gets a message on his phone from Beth, who is trapped in her apartment. Meanwhile, Hud watches the news and sees live images of the monster rubbing its back against buildings and dropping dog-sized parasites on the ground. The parasites start attacking people. Rob, however, decides to try and help Beth, and the friends all agree to follow him.They make their way further north, towards midtown, and have an up-close encounter with the monster when the army comes and tries to shoot it down. The group panic, and run into a subway to try and escape. When they are below the streets, they discover that they can get to the other side of Central Park from Beth\u0027s apartment by following the train tracks and then turning west down Central Park South, and begin to walk through the tunnels. They are ambushed by the parasites during their walk, and during the attack Marlena gets badly bitten by one. They hastily climb into the abandoned Bloomingdale\u0027s via the 59th Street subway station. They are led by a squad of infantry to an army field hospital, which was set up to care for the hundreds of wounded civilians scattered around the city.Shortly after arriving at the hospital, Marlena is dragged behind a paramedics screen and we see her silhouette gruesomely expand and then explode, some sort of viral effect brought on by the bite she received. Some of the parasites, both alive and dead, are shown in containment cages being examined by a few white-coated scientists. The group are permitted by the sergeant to leave and try and help Beth, but to report at a military evacuation zone by 06:00 that morning. Hud has a minor break-down as they leave, but pulls himself together and they continue towards Columbus Circle in order to help Beth.When they reach the Time Warner Center, they find that the north tower has been pushed over and is leaning against the south tower. Hud suggests that they climb the stairs in the south tower and try and find a way onto the roof of the north one, and they manage to get themselves to Beth\u0027s apartment. When they get there, they find Beth lying on the floor with her shoulder impaled by a length of rebar. The group pull her up, and lead her back down to street level. They briefly see the monster again as they cross the roof of the north tower, and have another encounter with a parasite as the go down the stairwell. Rob stabs it with a fire axe and the four manage to escape. As they run to the evacuation zone - which is just by Grand Central Station - they see the monster step right over the station as they run by it. They hastily try and get on a helicopter, and are separated from Lily, who is put on a different helicopter. Hud, Beth and Rob get on the next helicopter, and begin to evacuate.As they fly over the city, they witness the monster being bombed by various planes and finally get knocked down into a building and under a cloud of smoke. As Hud shouts in joy, the monster suddenly rears up and smashes the rear rotor of the helicopter, sending the chopper circling towards the ground. It lands in Central Park and the group wake up a couple of minutes later, and help each other get out. The pilots are briefly seen in the helicopter dead.Rob injures his leg in the crash, and Hud puts the camera down to help him get away, but when he goes to retrieve it the monster suddenly steps over him and looks down at the camera. Rob and Beth look on from behind the helicopter as the monster bends down and scoops Hud up in its mouth, and for a few seconds the camera is inside the creature\u0027s mouth. The top part of Hud falls out of its mouth - camera and all - and Rob and Beth run over to him sobbing.Rob picks up the camera and carries it with him and Beth, and the two collapse under a bridge near the south eastern corner of the park. They sit there and listen as the bomb-warning siren goes off in the city, and Rob makes a last testimonial to the camera. As he quietly comforts Beth, a bomb drops on the park and the camera gets knocked out of Rob\u0027s hand, getting buried beneath some rubble. Rob and Beth each proclaim their love for each other just before another bomb goes off.The camera pauses, and then cuts to a shot of the ocean from the Coney Island Ferris Wheel. In the far distance, you can briefly see a Japanese satellite fall from the sky and crash into the ocean - a part of the film\u0027s viral marketing campaign. Rob turns the camera back towards him and Beth, and then zooms in on Beth\u0027s face. She says \"I had a good day.\" and then the tape freezes on her smiling face, and cuts to black.At the very end of the credits, there is a short static transmission that, when played backwards, says \"It\u0027s still alive.\"","numvotes":"390728","primarytitle":"Cloverfield"},"color":"rgb(82,77,74)","size":1.0},{"source":"Fantasy","target":"tt0085918","id":"7150","attributes":{"productioncompany":"Western International Pictures Inc.","countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"5.1","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"Mausoleum","storyline":"Traumatized by her mother\u0027s death, young Susan is becoming possessed by the same demon that possessed her mother before she died.

However, Susan refuses to leave with Cora and runs back into the cemetery, where she discovers the Nomed mausoleum. As the gate springs open, she enters, finding herself surrounded by green fog and the sound of thunder. When a tramp wanders in behind her, Susan\u0027s eyes turn luminous green and a mysterious man in a robe hits the tramp with some kind of spell. The tramp staggers from the structure with smoke and flames emanating from his face, resulting his head exploding. Susan kneels before the tomb and touches it, causing the lid to open and a claw-like hand to reach out.Twenty years later, psychiatrist Dr. Simon Andrews (Norman Burton) assures Cora that her ongoing concerns about Susan (Bobbie Bresee) are unfounded. Cora counters by handing Simon her father\u0027s history of the Nomed family, which describes a 300-year-old family curse. Simon dismisses the story as superstition, ignoring Cora\u0027s insistence that she has witnessed similarly erratic behavior in both her late sister and her niece. Despite Simon\u0027s skepticism, he reads the book, which explains how a demon \"broke free of the crown of thorns\" and now possesses the body of the firstborn daughter to each generation of Nomeds. It also states that the demon can only be cast out by reuniting it with the crown of thorns, which adorns the gate of the mausoleum.That evening, Susan\u0027s husband, Oliver Farrell (Marjoe Gortner), awakens her from a nap and offers to take her dancing to a nightclub, as their gardener, Ben (Maurice Sherbanee), watches with interest through a window. Shortly after arriving at the nightclub, Oliver is called back to his office, and the couple is followed to the exit by a drunken man, who is enamored by Susan. Offended by the man\u0027s rudeness, Susan follows him with her glowing green eyes and causes his car to burst into flames once he is inside. Oliver tries to rescue the man, but is unable to open the car doors. The drunken man burns to death inside his car.Ben appears at the Farrell home the next day and flirts openly with Susan while her husband is at work. She responds in kind, and their ensuing sexual encounter concludes with Susan using a garden claw to kill and mutilate Ben. The following morning, Cora arrives at the house, asking for Susan\u0027s signature on some estate papers. The demon overtakes Susan and uses powers of telekinesis to levitate Cora off the the floor and makes her torso split open, killing her as well.Oliver is unaware of his wife\u0027s alter ego until later that night, when he awakens to find Susan asleep in a rocking chair, bearing the demon\u0027s face. He telephones Simon, who maintains his skepticism and offers an appointment for the next day. Susan returns to normal, but Oliver is unable to sleep.In the morning, he asks Elsie (LaWanda Page), the maid, to look after Susan until he returns in the early afternoon. However, the green fog and pulsating light that surround Susan only encourage the maid to pack her suitcase and leave, never to return.Although Susan tells her husband that nothing is wrong, she keeps her appointment with Simon. The psychiatrist places her under hypnosis and records the session, during which the demon reveals itself. Afterward, Simon plays the tape for his colleague, Dr. Roni Logan (Sheri Mann), a specialist in the paranormal, who convinces him of Susan\u0027s demonic possession.Meanwhile, Susan invites a delivery boy (Chu Chu Malave) into her home with the promise of sex, but she transforms into the demon and uses powers to telekinesis to split his skull, killing him too.The next day, Simon informs Oliver of Susan\u0027s condition and instructs him to avoid close contact with her until the crown of thorns has been retrieved. That afternoon, Susan goes to a local shopping mall where she steals a painting from an art gallery. When the salesman pursues her, she uses her demon powers to levitate him high above the floor, then allows him to drop onto a conical metal sculpture on the ground level.Upon his return home, Oliver expresses dislike for the painting, which features a centaur and bare-breasted women. The tension between the couple continues through dinner, but Oliver later apologizes to Susan while she is taking a bubble bath, and she climbs from the tub to embrace him. A thunderstorm rages outside as Simon removes the crown of thorns from the mausoleum gate, and Susan tightens her embrace until it crushes Oliver\u0027s body (her bare breasts turn into two individual demon heads which their mouths filled with sharp teeth disembowel Oliver).Simon arrives at the house a little later to find Oliver dead in the bathtub and Susan playing with dolls in the attic. As Susan reminisces about her childhood, Simon places the crown of thorns on her head, removing the demon from her body and returning it to the cemetery. Simon and Susan arrive at the mausoleum, where they find the creature sprawled over the tomb. At the urging of Simon, Susan places the crown on the demon\u0027s head, and the tomb opens, trapping the monster inside as the sun rises outside.Susan emerges from the experience in a state of bewilderment, and Simon promises to explain everything over time (refusing to tell her about Oliver\u0027s fate). Before leaving the cemetery, Simon tells the caretaker (the same robed being from earlier), \"You\u0027ve known this secret and lived with it, like your father before you and his father before him,\" reminding him that no one is to enter the mausoleum. As Simon and Susan drive away, the caretaker reveals himself to be Ben, the gardener. He looks at the camera, breaking the fourth wall, and laughs.","numvotes":"2468","primarytitle":"Mausoleum"},"color":"rgb(76,80,97)","size":1.0},{"source":"body in art","target":"tt10358198","id":"7041","attributes":{"runtimeminutes":"116","sex of killer":"female","synopsis":"The movie begins with a couple heading to a mansion. Jeff and Hayley have either been invited or gotten themselves invited by the elite who have tons of connections that can help Jeff\u0027s burgeoning career as a playwright. He gives Hayley guidelines on how to behave making his wife even more nervous as she heads to the door.They knock and Sebastian opens the door and he pretty much asks them what they are doing here before closing the door on their face. Jeff has no self-esteem and knocks again. This time Sebastian answers with an ostentatious mask on his head that seems like horns of the devil. He invites the couple in and Hayley promptly hands him a bottle of wine. Sebastian isn\u0027t impressed because he thinks it is a twelve dollar bottle wine.The couple is introduced to Carmine, Vincent and Sadie. Some offhand remarks are passed and Hayley excuses herself to go to the bathroom. When she goes upstairs, she thinks she is seeing a statue in the bathroom. When she comes out, the statue is actually Agatha, another guest who hates wearing clothes.Hayley shies away and goes downstairs. At dinner, all the guests begin to show off their knowledge about opera music playing the background. Jeff brings up a story about having a lucky charm that is a chess piece. He\u0027s made fun of believing in plastic that is harmful to the environment. He\u0027s supposed to pick a lucky charm that is environment-friendly.Hayley stands up for him but he doesn\u0027t do the same when Hayley begins talking about her painful past where she was molested by one parent and seen her mother cut her own throat after killing her husband for touching their daughter inappropriately.The guests seem to like Hayley and sympathize with her. Jeff is embarrassed Hayley brought it up, excuses themselves and threatens her to behave in front of these sophisticated people.Sadie isn\u0027t too happy to see Hayley being treated so shabbily. Hayley goes away and when Sadie stretches her arms, Jeff makes a comment about her unshaved armpits to which Sadie reminds him that his opinion is neither desired nor required.Jeff is humiliated but his ego remains. Hayley takes her medication and when the guests are served wine, Jeff takes her glass since it would interfere with her medication.Soon the wine starts taking effect and Jeff realizes he\u0027s been drugged. Hayley too has been given some wine and she starts to feel woozy.The very next instant, Jeff\u0027s neck is chopped off. Hayley is shocked but too drunk to do anything but watch as blood splatters on the glass and the placement. She loses consciousness.When she awakens, Agatha is dressed in lingerie and Hayley is tied to a chair and made to watch as Agatha talks about putting herbs in Jeff\u0027s drink. She uses Jeff\u0027s headless body to satisfy herself. Hayley turns away.   When Hayley comes too again, she\u0027s at the kitchen where Jeff\u0027s body is being cut into pieces and being cooked. She\u0027s tied with black scarves that she easily frees herself from. Perhaps the hosts tied her casually for a reason. They wanted her to run because her anguish and desperation is entertainment to them.She runs outside and coincidentally finds the sheriff\u0027s car parked some distance away from the mansion. Sebastian follows her and explains to the sheriff that she\u0027s his sister-in-law who has mental issues. The sheriff tells him to shut up and asks Hayley to explain and when she does, laughs because the doctor who owns the mansion would never hurt anyone.   Still, he indulges Hayley and asks her to come with him to investigate the mansion because it\u0027s ridiculous that the doctor would want to eat anyone.Sebastian too is put in the backseat. Hayley has her reservations and is right when she doesn\u0027t want to get off the car. The sheriff manages to convince her and of course, her instincts are right. The sheriff is in on it as well and chides the hosts for doing such a shabby job binding, Hayley. He tells them to use the handcuffs.Hayley tries to make a run for it but is restrained easily. She is made to sit at the table while everyone feasts on Jeff. They relish every bite while Sadie appears and recites an incantation, snowing no modesty. She performs a ritual on Hayley who is tied up with scarves again.She suffers a seizure and suddenly gets violent. She breaks free from her binds and begins attacking everyone.   Sadie seems to be helping her as well.   In the end, it is only Sebastian left who is drinking the twelve- dollar bottled wine the couple brought when they arrived. He explains the story of his favorite opera the Pagliacci and then he too is murdered by Hayley the same way her husband was killed.All that is left is Sadie. She says to Hayley that she could chose her path. Hayley shoots Sadie twice and both shots hit her chest and though blood initially appears on her chest Sadie brushes them off and she\u0027s healed!!   She shows Hayley the tarot cards they had picked before and that even though she picked the death card, she was reminded it could also mean a new beginning for her.   Hayley wants to know who Sadie is and if she\u0027s the devil. Sadie laughs and says no as he eyes change shape and color.   Hayley picks another card and sees Adam and Eve. She asks Sadie if she\u0027s the first woman to which Sadie agrees. She explains she was never expelled from paradise but left of her own free will. She said she\u0027s always been looking for love and that she knows Hayley didn\u0027t just witness her parent\u0027s death but caused them.   She asks Hayley to join her and always be by her side forever. Hayley agrees with a kiss.Later on, a couple is seen walking to the mansion and nervous about meeting the couple who is well connected and will help their careers.   Hayley invites them and is wearing the same mask Sebastian was in the beginning. It is implied that they are going to do the same ritual that was done on Hayley and Jeff.(thanks to darkhorrortales blogspot)","numvotes":"7485","primarytitle":"The Dinner Party","productioncompany":"Artist Vodka Films","countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"5.0","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"The Dinner Party","storyline":"A budding playwright and his wife attend a dinner party hosted by wealthy, cultural elites, who have promised to bankroll the writer\u0027s latest play to Broadway, but, in fact, have darker designs in mind for the couple.","startyear":"2020","role of artist":"killer"},"color":"rgb(106,93,97)","size":1.0},{"source":"Thriller","target":"tt0098054","id":"6956","attributes":{"runtimeminutes":"104","sex of killer":"male","numvotes":"243","primarytitle":"Paint It Black","productioncompany":"Vestron Pictures","countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"4.8","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"Paint It Black","sex of artist":"male","storyline":"A serial killer covers his victims in modeling clay, and a local sculptor is accused of the crimes.","startyear":"1989","role of artist":"victim"},"color":"rgb(106,93,97)","size":3.0},{"source":"Thriller","target":"tt1288645","id":"6880","attributes":{"productioncompany":"LifeLike Pictures","countriesoforigin":"Indonesia","averagerating":"6.6","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"Pintu Terlarang","sex of artist":"male","storyline":"The life of a successful sculptor is turned upside down when he begins receiving mysterious messages from someone who asks for his help.","startyear":"2009","runtimeminutes":"115","role of artist":"protagonist","numvotes":"2176","primarytitle":"Pintu Terlarang"},"color":"rgb(65,97,106)","size":3.0},{"source":"Comedy","target":"tt1865573","id":"7072","attributes":{"notes":"Comedy or satire","runtimeminutes":"91","sex of killer":"male","synopsis":"A SWAT team barges into a school library to find a student holding an axe and surrounded by savaged bodies, before the film goes back eight hours previously. Six unruly prep school students are forced to serve Saturday detention for eight hours at Crestview Academy, where psychologist Dr. Day (Jeffrey Schmidt) conducts psychological testing on the students to examine their personalities and trigger their demeanors, recording each session in the process. Despite receiving an expulsion notice from Headmaster Nash (Judd Nelson), a new low-income student Matt Clark (Cameron Deane Stewart) plans to compensate for his poor behavior by joining the awkward Tarek Ahmed (Marc Donato), the jock Craig Cook (Roger Edwards), the sly Goth girl Veronica Harmon (Augie Duke), the prissy and asthmatic Megan McDurst (Amanda Alch), and the popular girl Tricia Wilkes (Ali Faulkner) in detention.   After giving them the task to complete a school history assignment, Dr. Day restricts their internet reach and takes away many of their phones, leaving the students imprisoned alone in the library, remodeled by the janitor, Max (Ben Browder), with Native American portraits and an Apache statue. The students believe the library is haunted. They realize they have mutually dysfunctional family lives, though they have their differences with each other, sparked from prior encounters which have been recorded on camera. They all try to break out of the library, but they are sealed in. Behaving mischievous, Veronica hides Megans inhaler and frames Tarek, leading to Megan having a shortness of breath and dying before its found.   Getting the internet to work, Veronica does her research. They discover an old, deceased Indian, Jacob Rainwater, once owned land that was stolen from the Apache tribe in the 1870s by a General, Andrew Winston Clarke, before it was taken over by the city of Crestview to build the school. As the students argue on-and-off, they find a vent to navigate to different rooms that have its doors locked on both sides. Thereby, they learn Matt has an undisclosed criminal background and become suspicious of him. After Tarek goes missing and they return to the library through the vent, they discover Tricias powerful mother is the Governor, Craigs father is the city councilman, and Megan\u0027s father co-owns the property of which Tareks father is responsible for building the library, all of who made an agreement with the school to ensure their spoiled kids would be guaranteed to graduate in exchange for the construction of the library.   A dark storm rages on outside the school, tampering with the lights and electronics inside, increasing the students fear of the paranormal. In an accident, Craig falls down the steps in the library and is mysteriously staked by one of his crutches, dying instantly. Not long after, Tricia admits her mother was the reason why Jacob lost his house, and Veronica secures evidence on Craigs camera showing that Tricia, Craig, Megan and Tarek had killed Jacob at his home to vacate the ownership of the property, leaving no next of kin to take over. Deeply believing in ghosts, they attempt to contact Jacobs spirit so that Tricia can call a truce, but the spirit rebels and seemingly harms Veronica. The spirit then appears, and she uses a nail gun to commit suicide due to fright.   Shortly after, Dr. Day emerges to reveal his alliance with Veronica. The whole time, they masterminded everyone\u0027s paranormal delusions and emotional outbursts, triggered by psychological tests (inkblots), all to sell the story and make money. Killed by Dr. Day for trying to escape through the vent, Tarek\u0027s dead body is what was used as the ghost. Before Veronica can shoot Matt using the nail gun, Dr. Day abruptly kills her with an axe for poisoning him and causing his diarrhea earlier. Matt is framed for all the murders, as an unexpected booby trap involving the statue severs Dr. Day\u0027s head, killing him. A SWAT team barges in to find Matt armed with an axe in the middle of the carnage. Matt is subdued and placed in a straitjacket. Max arrives, revealing his Apache ancestor, Jacob Rainwater, owned the house where the school now stands, which at one time was also taken by General Clark and his army over a century ago. In the closing credits, Matt is driven away in an ambulance and Tricia\u0027s Governor mother, Tareks father and Craigs father pay off Max in order to clear them of any involvement in the incident.","numvotes":"3705","primarytitle":"Bad Kids Go to Hell","productioncompany":"BKGTH Productions","countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"4.5","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"Bad Kids Go to Hell","storyline":"The Breakfast Club meets The Grudge in this sexy, dark comedy-thriller!

Now as the movie opens, they are attending the wedding of Ralph Hapschatt (Jeremy Newson) and Betty Monroe (Hilary Labow) in which Brad is Ralph\u0027s best man and Janet is the maid of honor. Inspired by the events around him, as soon as the other guests leave, Brad asks Janet to marry him in a song (\u0027Damnit Janet\u0027) inside the church and she accepts. Joyous, the couple decide to go tell Dr. Scott the good news.Appearing all through the movie, a Criminologist (Charles Gray) comes on and explains that we are about to embark on a strange journey following the misadventures of Brad and Janet. He mentions that despite the storm clouds gathering, the two decided to go for a long drive in the country anyway even though their spare tire was badly in need of air. He claims that Brad and Janet will have \"a night to remember for a very long, time.\"Back to Brad and Janet, as they drive on, the sun sets and, sure enough, it begins to rain very heavily. Janet is starting to feel ill at ease considering how far out they are and that a bunch of bikers keep passing them on the road and suggests that they should turn back before something bad happens. We hear a loud BANG! and the car skids to a stop.Brad realizes he messed up badly by not refilling the spare tire and suggests that the two of them go to an old castle they passed along the way to call for help. Janet isn\u0027t so sure this is a good idea, but Brad talks her into it anyway as there\u0027s not much they can do otherwise. As they walk through the rain, Janet tries to shield herself with a newspaper, telling herself through a song that no matter how bad things get, there\u0027s always a good side and that things will always get better. (\u0027There\u0027s a Light... over at the Frankenstein Place\u0027)Soon the two arrive on the front doorstep of the castle. Brad knocks and just as the two were about to leave, the door is opened by Riffraff (Richard O\u0027Brien), a tall, gaunt, balding butler in a stark black suit. He glares at them, further unnerving Janet, though Brad tries to be friendly, introducing himself and Janet and explaining that they need a phone as their car has broken down nearby.The foyer is outlandishly decorated with dark wooden furniture, stuffed dead animals and hunting trophies, and random relics and curiosities. Riffraff explains to Brad and Janet that they\u0027ve arrived on a very special night as \"the master\" is having a party, where Brad and Janet meet the equally strainge house maid Magenta (Patricia Quinn), which leads into the infamous song \"The Time Warp\".The Criminologist comes on and explains the steps to the \u0027Time Warp\u0027 dance.Brad and Janet are ushered into a great hall with a throne and a jukebox at it\u0027s far end where conventionists of every size and description wearing tuxedos and party hats are dancing and singing the (\u0027Time Warp\u0027). During the song we are introduced to the gold-sequin-wearing, tap dancing Columbia (Little Nell). All of this is too much for Janet and Brad who try to sneak out carefully. Janet begs Brad to leave as the place is creepy, but Brad simply says that they should stay to watch more \"folk dancing.\" Janet refuses as she\u0027s \"cold, wet and just plain scared!\", though Brad tries to reassure her.Janet turns around to leave and sees Dr. Frank N. Furter (Tim Curry) in full drag regalia, wrapped up in a black cloak. She screams and faints. Frank introduces himself though a song as a (\u0027Sweet Transvestite\u0027) from Transsexual, Transylvania\". Brad asks him for help, explaining his plight, and Frank smirks and acknowledges that yeah, Brad needs help, and offers him a mechanic at first only to change his mind as \"Maybe the rain isn\u0027t REALLY to blame\" and instead decides to \"remove the cause but NOT the symptoms.\"Frank then goes into an elevator and rises upstairs to the applause of the partying conventionists. Riffraff and Magenta strip Brad and Janet down to their underwear. Brad and Janet then are prodded into the elevator and taken upstairs to Frank\u0027s laboratory.Brad and Janet are led out into the center of an observing room where they are put on display by Dr. Frank N. Furter, now wearing a lab coat and long surgical gloves. The Transylvanian conventionists watch the events from an above balcony. Frank N. Furter then walks over to a box-like shape covered by a tarp and throws off the covering to reveal a tank. He shouts for Magenta and Riffraff to set the controls and start the machinery as the room darkens. Frank himself laughs maniacally as he turns knobs, dials, and wheels as fluids pour into the tank and a humanoid form appears slowly, skeleton first, much to Janet and Brad\u0027s terror.Carefully, Frank N. Furter leads out the humanoid figure wrapped entirely in bandages and cuts them away to reveal a full-grown man with blond hair, tanned skin, blue eyes and a muscular figure wearing only a skimpy golden bikini over his crotch. Riffraff spins some wheels he shouldn\u0027t have while cackling to himself, setting the blond man, known as Rocky Horror (Peter Hinwood), loose. Frank chases Rocky through the lab crying his name as a bouncy song about the creation (\u0027I Can Make You a Man\u0027), Rocky feeling a sense of dread plays. Eventually Frank catches Rocky and scolds him for misbehaving, but says he forgives him as he\u0027s beautiful (\u0027Sword of Damocles\u0027).Then, the deep freeze malfunctions and Columbia squeals, \"Eddie!\" A burly, heavyset biker named Eddie (Meatloaf) rides out on a motorcycle, dressed in black leather, singing about his former glory (\u0027Whatever Happened to Saturday Night?/Hot Patootie\u0027) The conventionists eat it up, enjoying the show, but Frank becomes wrathful that Eddie stole his thunder and takes out a pickax, chasing Eddie into the deep freeze where he is hacked to bits. This puts everyone, even the giddy conventionists into a shocked and somber mood. Frank, tires to pick things up by talking about how beautiful Rocky is in a song (\u0027I Can Make You a Man, reprise\u0027), leading away his new creation to a \"bedchamber\" in a wedding-style procession.The Criminologist comes on again and mentions that Brad and Janet are in trouble now as they are being led away to separate rooms for the night.While separated, Frank N. Furter comes into Janet\u0027s bedroom, dressed as Brad, and seduces Janet. Then he goes into Brad\u0027s room, dressed as Janet and tries to seduce Brad. Brad puts up a little bit of a fight, but is talked into it. Afterwards, Janet feels frightened and used and goes to look for Brad. Meanwhile, Rocky escapes from the bedchamber and is running loose, chased by dogs through the rain outside the castle by the gleeful Riffraff. While wandering the castle lost and afraid, Janet encounters Rocky hiding in his tank at the lab. Seeing that he\u0027s injured, she tears her petticoat to bandage his wounds, pausing as she realizes she\u0027s aroused.The Criminologist comes on and mentions the complexity of human emotions and the dangers of lust. He fades away to Magenta and Columbia who are secretly watching Rocky and Janet in the tank via a monitor in their room.Janet tries to seduce Rocky, explaining that she used to be a virgin, but now she finds she really likes sex and wants it NOW (\u0027Toucha Toucha Touch Me\u0027). Rocky is more than happy to oblige. Meanwhile, Columbia and Magenta watch in secret from the closed circuited TV, laughing and playing with one another, making fun of the events unfolding before them.As the two women enjoy one another, Frank N. Furter beats up Riffraff for letting Rocky loose, while Brad watches with horror. An alarm goes off and Riffraff looks on another TV monitor and mentions that someone is outside by the main gate as they all look and see a middle aged man in a wheelchair buzzing the intercom at the front gate. Dr. Everett Scott (Jonathan Adams) has arrived at the castle. Brad recognizes his old teacher and is happy to see him, but Frank N. Furter is angry that the two know one another, recognizing Dr. Scott as a federal agent investigating UFOs, suspecting Brad and Janet are actually spies. Brad denies this, explaining that Dr. Scott is his science teacher from Denton High, but Frank doesn\u0027t believe him.Meanwhile, Dr. Scott enters the castle and finds himself alone in the \u0027zen room\u0027 filled with various smoldering insence. Frank N. Furter takes Brad to the lab where he turns on a powerful magnet to drag Dr Scott\u0027s wheelchair up to them... with Dr. Scott still inside it. The clunk of Dr. Scott\u0027s wheelchair arriving wakes the sleeping Janet and Rocky who sit up in shock. Everyone in the room is frightened, confused and hurt to see one another here. Magenta appears up and announces that dinner is ready. Attempting to handle things with grace, Dr. Frank N. Furter dismisses everyone for dinner, informing them that formal attire is optional as he stomps off enraged.Everyone meets in a grand dining room for a dinner of roasted beef and vegetables in honor of Rocky\u0027s Birthday. Frank demands that everyone sing Rocky \"Happy Birthday.\" Dr. Scott reveals in a song (\u0027Eddie\u0027s Teddy\u0027) that he\u0027s not here to investigate Frank and his household, but to look for his nephew, Eddie, who went missing with a cryptic cry for help in a letter being the last contact he had from him. Sure, Eddie was a no good kid, but he\u0027s still family. In response to this, the tablecloth is pulled off the table to reveal Eddie\u0027s hacked-up body in a glass case... and the fact that they were being served roast Eddie for dinner. Brad and Dr. Scott are paralyzed with terror, and Janet runs to Rocky\u0027s arms. Frank is outraged, slapping Janet. Janet runs away with Frank chasing after her, encouraging her through a song (\u0027Once in a While\u0027) to stop sleeping with everyone else as she\u0027s now his.Janet, followed by Frank N. Furter, Rocky, Brad, and Dr. Scott end up in the lab again. Frank pulls a switch to \"glue\" everyone\u0027s feet to the floor but his. Everyone tells Frank he\u0027s a \"Hot dog.\" In response, he simply flips a switch and turns them all to stone. Columbia comes in and tells Frank he\u0027s gone too far this time as now people are really hurt. Frank N Furter simply responds by turning Columbia to stone, too. He then tells Riffraff and Magenta to prepare for the floor show.The Criminologist comes on and hints that in this place where nothing\u0027s as it seems, the Floor Show is going to be something very shocking.The next scene we see the statue versions of everyone on stage, now all wearing fishnets, makeup, a thong and the same bustier. One by one they are unfrozen, and they each sing and dance a song (\u0027Floor Show\u0027) about how they\u0027ve changed since they came here. Rocky and Columbia sing about their past times (\u0027Rose Tint My World\u0027). Frank N. Furter, Brad and Janet sing their own version (\u0027Fanfare/Don\u0027t Dream It\u0027). Dr. Scott is accidentally unfrozen and realizes that this place is a trap and everyone should run while they still are sane enough to escape. Frank N. Furter comes out like a prized showgirl and sings a solo, starting an orgy in a swimming pool that is uncovered as he sings. After the orgy, Frank N. Furter sings a song praising his wild and untamed household (\u0027Wild and Untamed Thing\u0027).This song, however is interrupted by Riffraff and Magenta, now wearing strange uniforms and armed with laser ray guns. Riffraff informs Frank that it\u0027s all over as his mission was a failure due to Frank becoming too extreme. He declares that Frank is now his and Magenta\u0027s prisoner as he has been made commander, and that they\u0027re going back to their home planet of Transylvania in the Galaxy of Transexual immediately. Frank is happy for this, singing about how long he\u0027s been wanting to go back to the homeland he was exiled from (\u0027I\u0027m Going Home\u0027). Riffraff stops him again and explains that only he and Magenta are going home; Frank N. Furter is to be killed as Riffraff replies: \"say hello to oblivion\". Riffraff points a ray gun at Frank, but Columbia screams in an attempt to save Frank. Riffraff quickly turns around and kills her. Riffraff then kills Frank as he tries to run away. Rocky, seeing his creator fall, grabs Frank and climbs the set in the background of the stage, crying in rage and pain. It takes several shots from the ray gun, but Rocky is killed and falls into the pool where he and his creator float dead.Riffraff turns to Brad, Janet and Dr. Scott and tells them to leave now while they still can and they do so. Meanwhile, in a now empty house, Magenta and Riffraff celebrate going home as an incestuous relationship is implied. Brad and Janet, carrying Dr. Scott, escape just as the castle explodes and flies away under a rainbow and blue skies of dawn back to Riffraff and Magenta\u0027s home planet, leaving Dr. Scott, Janet, and Brad writing on the charred ground, still in drag from the floor show as it flies away into space. (In some versions the three of them sing one final song about loss of innocence called \u0027Superheros\u0027.)The Criminologist comes back one last time with the somber, iconic lines describing the flying away of the house:\"And crawling... on the planet\u0027s face... some insects... called the human race.

Many years before the events in The Exorcist, the young Father Merrin (played by Skarsgård, who played the same part in Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist) travels to East Africa. Merrin has taken a sabbatical from the Church and devoted himself to history and archaeology as he struggles with his shattered faith. He is haunted especially by an incident in a small village in occupied Holland during World War II, where he served as parish priest: near the end of the war, a sadistic Nazi SS commander, in retaliation for the murder of a German trooper, forces Merrin to participate in arbitrary executions in order to save a full village from slaughter.After World War II, Merrin is an archaeologist in Cairo, when he is approached by a collector of antiquities who asks him to come to a British excavation in the Turkana region of Kenya. This dig is excavating a Christian Byzantine church built circa 500 A.D. long before Christianity had reached that region of Africa. The collector asks Merrin to recover an ancient relic of a demon before the British can find it. Merrin agrees and travels to the dig site. He is joined by Father Francis, a Vatican scholar who was on his way to do missionary work in East Africa but was diverted by the Vatican to ensure the church is not desecrated. Upon arriving at the site, Merrin meets Major Granville, the British military officer in charge of the dig. Merrin also meets the chief excavator, a brutish man with visible boils on his face. And he meets Sarah, a doctor who spent time in a concentration camp during World War II and is haunted by what happened to her there. Merrin\u0027s translator and guide is Chuma. In addition, Merrin learns that the diggers are disappearing or leaving in droves because the local tribemen fear the church is cursed. Merrin witnesses a digger inexplicably experience a seizure.Merrin visits the dig site. Only the dome is uncovered; the rest of the church is buried beneath the earth. Merrin discovers that the church is in perfect condition, as though it had been buried immediately after its construction were completed. Merrin, Francis, and Chuma enter the church through the dome. They find it is near-pristine condition, but there are two oddities. First, all of the statues of the angels holding weapons are pointing the spears downward, whereas it is conventional for statues of angels to either have no weapons or to point them triumphantly toward heaven. Merrin and Francis deduce the sculptors were trying to depict the angels restraining something that was beneath the church. The second disturbing discovery is that someone has vandalized the church by ripping the enormous crucifix from its place on the altar and suspending it with Christ on the cross in an upside-down position, which is considered a desecration.Merrin is determined to learn more about the archeological dig and asks to consult with the lead archeologist, Monsieur Bession. Sarah tells Merrin that Bession went insane three weeks earlier and was transferred to a mental hospital in Nairobi. Merrin visits Bession\u0027s tent at the dig site and sees dozens of drawings of the same thing, the demon artifact the collector had asked Merrin to find. Merrin then travels to Nairobi to visit Bession. But when he enters Bession\u0027s room, he discovers Bession has carved a swastika on his chest and is speaking through demonic possession in the voice of the sadistic SS commander who tormented Merrin during the war. As Merrin registers these events, Bession slashes his own throat after saying he was \"free.\" Father Gionetti, warden of the asylum, speculates that Bession was not possessed but rather \"touched\" by a demon, which drove him mad and eventually to suicide. Merrin is very skeptical, but before he returns to the dig site, Father Gionetti gives him the volume of Roman rituals to use in exorcism, although Merrin claims he will never use them.Upon returning to the village, strange events continue. A local boy is attacked and killed by hyenas that seem to continuously stalk the dig, night and day. His younger brother, Joseph, enters a fugue state after watching his brother ripped to pieces. Merrin begins to suspect that something evil lies in the church and is infecting the region. There are stories of an epidemic that wiped out an entire village. However, when Merrin, growing suspicious of these rumors, digs up one of the graves of the supposed victims of this plague, he discovers it is empty. Meanwhile, the evil grows, turning people against each other and resulting in violence, atrocities, and more bloodshed.Father Francis reveals to Merrin that the builders of the church never meant it to be recorded in Vatican documents, however, a vague reference to it was recorded, leading to its subsequent discoveries in the 19th and 20th centuries. Francis also reveals that the church stands on the supposed site where Satan fell to earth after the war in heaven, and it was constructed by early Christians in an attempt to purify the evil that resides there.Beneath the church lies the ruins of an even older temple but not a Christian one. Rather, in the ruins under the church, Merrin and his allies find demonic icons, and other signs of evil and Satanism. This land is where he first encounters the demon that calls itself Pazuzu, which he will encounter again in The Exorcist. This is the demon that \"brushed\" Bession (driving him insane) and Joseph (making him ill).At the end of the movie, the dig\u0027s doctor, Sarah, turns out to be the possessed individual and has the demon exorcised from her in the tunnels below the church but dies. Dr. Merrin and Joseph emerge from the church, (once again buried in sand) and history has repeated itself. 50 (and 1500) years ago, everyone at the site was killed by an evil presence from the church, except for one priest. Now, only Father Merrin and the little boy are left as the British soldiers and the local tribes have annihilated each other. Merrin returns to Rome and meets with the collector at a cafe, explaining he was unable to find the relic, the collector replies, \"But you found something....Didn\u0027t you?\"... As he leaves, Merrin is revealed to be wearing a collar and is now a priest again, having regained his faith in God, after defeating the demon with holy exorcism rituals.","numvotes":"36569","primarytitle":"Exorcist: The Beginning"},"color":"rgb(65,97,106)","size":1.0},{"source":"Thriller","target":"tt10358198","id":"7040","attributes":{"runtimeminutes":"116","sex of killer":"female","synopsis":"The movie begins with a couple heading to a mansion. Jeff and Hayley have either been invited or gotten themselves invited by the elite who have tons of connections that can help Jeff\u0027s burgeoning career as a playwright. He gives Hayley guidelines on how to behave making his wife even more nervous as she heads to the door.They knock and Sebastian opens the door and he pretty much asks them what they are doing here before closing the door on their face. Jeff has no self-esteem and knocks again. This time Sebastian answers with an ostentatious mask on his head that seems like horns of the devil. He invites the couple in and Hayley promptly hands him a bottle of wine. Sebastian isn\u0027t impressed because he thinks it is a twelve dollar bottle wine.The couple is introduced to Carmine, Vincent and Sadie. Some offhand remarks are passed and Hayley excuses herself to go to the bathroom. When she goes upstairs, she thinks she is seeing a statue in the bathroom. When she comes out, the statue is actually Agatha, another guest who hates wearing clothes.Hayley shies away and goes downstairs. At dinner, all the guests begin to show off their knowledge about opera music playing the background. Jeff brings up a story about having a lucky charm that is a chess piece. He\u0027s made fun of believing in plastic that is harmful to the environment. He\u0027s supposed to pick a lucky charm that is environment-friendly.Hayley stands up for him but he doesn\u0027t do the same when Hayley begins talking about her painful past where she was molested by one parent and seen her mother cut her own throat after killing her husband for touching their daughter inappropriately.The guests seem to like Hayley and sympathize with her. Jeff is embarrassed Hayley brought it up, excuses themselves and threatens her to behave in front of these sophisticated people.Sadie isn\u0027t too happy to see Hayley being treated so shabbily. Hayley goes away and when Sadie stretches her arms, Jeff makes a comment about her unshaved armpits to which Sadie reminds him that his opinion is neither desired nor required.Jeff is humiliated but his ego remains. Hayley takes her medication and when the guests are served wine, Jeff takes her glass since it would interfere with her medication.Soon the wine starts taking effect and Jeff realizes he\u0027s been drugged. Hayley too has been given some wine and she starts to feel woozy.The very next instant, Jeff\u0027s neck is chopped off. Hayley is shocked but too drunk to do anything but watch as blood splatters on the glass and the placement. She loses consciousness.When she awakens, Agatha is dressed in lingerie and Hayley is tied to a chair and made to watch as Agatha talks about putting herbs in Jeff\u0027s drink. She uses Jeff\u0027s headless body to satisfy herself. Hayley turns away.   When Hayley comes too again, she\u0027s at the kitchen where Jeff\u0027s body is being cut into pieces and being cooked. She\u0027s tied with black scarves that she easily frees herself from. Perhaps the hosts tied her casually for a reason. They wanted her to run because her anguish and desperation is entertainment to them.She runs outside and coincidentally finds the sheriff\u0027s car parked some distance away from the mansion. Sebastian follows her and explains to the sheriff that she\u0027s his sister-in-law who has mental issues. The sheriff tells him to shut up and asks Hayley to explain and when she does, laughs because the doctor who owns the mansion would never hurt anyone.   Still, he indulges Hayley and asks her to come with him to investigate the mansion because it\u0027s ridiculous that the doctor would want to eat anyone.Sebastian too is put in the backseat. Hayley has her reservations and is right when she doesn\u0027t want to get off the car. The sheriff manages to convince her and of course, her instincts are right. The sheriff is in on it as well and chides the hosts for doing such a shabby job binding, Hayley. He tells them to use the handcuffs.Hayley tries to make a run for it but is restrained easily. She is made to sit at the table while everyone feasts on Jeff. They relish every bite while Sadie appears and recites an incantation, snowing no modesty. She performs a ritual on Hayley who is tied up with scarves again.She suffers a seizure and suddenly gets violent. She breaks free from her binds and begins attacking everyone.   Sadie seems to be helping her as well.   In the end, it is only Sebastian left who is drinking the twelve- dollar bottled wine the couple brought when they arrived. He explains the story of his favorite opera the Pagliacci and then he too is murdered by Hayley the same way her husband was killed.All that is left is Sadie. She says to Hayley that she could chose her path. Hayley shoots Sadie twice and both shots hit her chest and though blood initially appears on her chest Sadie brushes them off and she\u0027s healed!!   She shows Hayley the tarot cards they had picked before and that even though she picked the death card, she was reminded it could also mean a new beginning for her.   Hayley wants to know who Sadie is and if she\u0027s the devil. Sadie laughs and says no as he eyes change shape and color.   Hayley picks another card and sees Adam and Eve. She asks Sadie if she\u0027s the first woman to which Sadie agrees. She explains she was never expelled from paradise but left of her own free will. She said she\u0027s always been looking for love and that she knows Hayley didn\u0027t just witness her parent\u0027s death but caused them.   She asks Hayley to join her and always be by her side forever. Hayley agrees with a kiss.Later on, a couple is seen walking to the mansion and nervous about meeting the couple who is well connected and will help their careers.   Hayley invites them and is wearing the same mask Sebastian was in the beginning.

The Director\u0027s cut runs 14 minutes longer and this synopsis caters for both versions.A thunderstorm filled, rainy night in the small town of Fairwater. A woman called Patricia Bradley (Dee Wallace) is been chased by a mysterious entity around the old-looking house in which she lives with her mother (Julianna Mcarthy). Patricia is screaming and fearing for her life. Her mother appears from her bedroom with a pump action shotgun and shoots the mysterious figure as its shape appears through the carpet at the top of the stairs.Some of the residents of Fairwater are gathering for a funeral in the community as the local newspaper editor Magda Rees Jones (Elizabeth Hawthorne) and her assistant are reporting the story of another seemingly innocent death amongst the residents. Psychic investigator Frank Bannister (Michael Andrew Fox) arrives at the funeral trying desperately to advertise his services. As he leaves in his wrecked and dirty looking Volkswagen, his reckless driving causes him to nearly hit an on-coming truck. As he swerves to miss it, he crashes straight through a garden fence. Ray Lynskey (Peter Dobson) comes out of his house infuriated and threatens to sue him for the damages. Frank gives him his business card and drives off after deliberately driving over one of Ray\u0027s garden gnomes.On the other side of town Ray\u0027s wife Doctor Lucy Lynskey (Trini Alvarado), visits the Bradley house to treat Patricia\u0027s cuts. She bandages her hand and tells her that she needs to take her to hospital but her mother (Julianna McCarthy) refuses to let her go. She tells her that she never leaves the house and to just give her some antibiotics. Lucy notices how timid and fragile Patricia is and as she gets ready to leave, she notices some bruising around her neck. Patricia\u0027s mother rushes Lucy out of the house and tells her that her daughter is not to be trusted. She was involved in cold-blooded murder.Becoming intrigued by Patricia\u0027s history, Lucy watches a documentary about the notorious serial killer Johnny Bartlett (Jake Busey).\"In the space of 27 blood-soaked minutes, 12 innocent people gunned down by hospital orderly John Charles Bartlett. Patients, medical staff, visitors, no one was spared in this madman\u0027s rampage through Fairwater Sanatorium.Not even the hospital chapel provided sanctuary,as those in prayer were gunned down on their knees. A seemingly senseless crime, Bartlett\u0027s motive remains a mystery to this day. Six years earlier Charles Starkweather had murdered 11 people in a Nebraska killing spree\".The black and white footage shows the horrific scenes at the hospital of the victims and the families, as well as the footage of Bartlett being escorted to court by the police boasting about his disgusting act.\"Fifteen year-old Patricia Ann Bradley, daughter of the hospital administrator, was also implicated in the killings. She was madly in love with the psychopath Bartlett. 2,200 volts of electricity ended the life of Johnny Bartlett, the unrepented killer. As they threw the switch he was heard to scream: I got me a score of twelve. Beat that!\" In what some consider a miscarriage of justice, Patricia Ann Bradley was sentenced to life imprisonment although it was never proven that she actively participated in the killings.

It hovers up in the air as the couple panic. Objects start flying everywhere in the kitchen.Lucy calls Frank and he arrives to rid the house of the supernatural. Instead of charging the couple,he offers to do it in return for not having to pay for the damaged fence.Ray reluctantly agrees and Frank uses his \"equipment\" to capture the spooks and pours them down the sink. As he is packing his stuff up,he is shocked to see a glowing number 37 on Ray\u0027s forehead. Lucy cannot see this and Ray kicks Frank out of the house.Frank arrives at his home to his half-built house that he hasn\u0027t finished working on. As he gets out of is car,a spirit exits the trunk - a young, 1950\u0027s nerd called Stuart (Jim Fyfe), followed by a 1970\u0027s, afro-haired ghost called Cyrus (Chi Mcbride). The ghosts are Frank\u0027s associates who help him con the local residents by haunting their homes, so that Frank can step in and reap the rewards. While Stuart is just about to join them in the house, Frank closes the door and he gets stuck because his ectoplasm has become too stiff. Frank asks them if they had anything to do with the glowing number appearing on Ray\u0027s head but the spirits don\u0027t know what he\u0027s talking about.(Director\u0027s cut) Cyrus helps pull Stuart through the door.

As they are talking, gunshots go off, as another spirit, a judge from the 1800\u0027s (John Astin) enters the room trying to shoot the ghost dog Rhustler as he gnaws on his jawbone. Frank gets his jaw back and tells him to put his guns away.(Director\u0027s cut) Frank cuts some wood off from the roof of his house for his fireplace.He sits looking through the newspaper, trying to find people that have recently lost family, while The Judge contemplates going off into the graveyard to rest his decrepit body. Frank tells him he needs him his help in order to finish his house but The Judge tells him to stop with his scheming ways and to stop using death to make a living.(Director\u0027s cut) Frank walks out of the living room and is horrified to see a Grim Reaper figure moving down the stairs towards him. The figure moves in close to him but it is only Cyrus and Stuart underneath a cape. They tell him they are trying to figure out different ways to scare people but Frank isn\u0027t amused and walks off angry. The next morning Frank receives a letter from his bank informing him that he owes $16,000 dollars. He needs some money fast and he calls the spirits for a meeting demanding that they up their antics to really frighten people.Cyrus and Stuart arrive at a rich woman\u0027s house and start causing fear by picking up the resident\u0027s babies and scaring the mother and her maid as they see the babies hovering through the air. Again they leave one of Frank\u0027s business cards. Frank gets the phone call and sets off.(Director\u0027s cut) Frank is trying to drive to the house as fast as he can but he keeps getting stuck in traffic because the roads are blocked with funeral cars. The Judge is sat in the passenger\u0027s seat and tells him that there is something very sinister dawning over Fairwater. But Frank isn\u0027t interested in what he\u0027s saying.He impatiently and recklessly pulls out into the line of funeral cars and dodges around the traffic. He pulls up outside the house and tells Judge to wait for him.Frank walks into the house and attempts to pull off his scheme but the woman is not interested. She has in her hand the local newspaper which shows a picture of Frank with the headline \"Local conman haunts cemetery\". Frank is angry. He confronts Magda Rees Jones at the local Gazette about printing the story but she tells him he is a parasite who makes money off of the bereaved and she has every right to let people know about him. He leaves and he sees that another funeral is taking place.He sees Lucy in one of the cars crying. As he walks off down the street he is shocked to see Ray running towards him. But not in human form. Ray is now dead. His spirit runs straight into him. Ray is panicking and can\u0027t understand how he\u0027s died so young and fit. He tells Frank that just before he died he felt his heart been crushed while he was working out. Frank tries to explain the rules of the afterlife to him. Ray asks Frank to give him a ride to his funeral.(Director\u0027s cut) As Frank pulls up to the graveyard in his car, Ray (not yet used to being a spirit) has trouble grabbing hold of the door handle to get out. Frank pushes him through the car door and he lands on the ground.They walk through the graveyard and Ray is petrified as he witnesses many spirits roaming the grounds. Drill Sergeant Hiles (R.Lee Ermey), the watchful spirit of the other ghosts, walks out of his tomb and orders the ghosts to get back in their graves. Frank knows there will be trouble. He tells Ray to go on ahead while he talks to the angry sergeant. The two have a fight but with Hiles\u0027s supernatural abilities, Frank has no chance.While Hiles shouts to tell the inhbitants of the graveyard who\u0027s in charge, Frank goes off to join Ray at his funeral. As Ray becomes very emotional at his tragic death, he falls into the grave as he tries to put his arms around Lucy. He is horrified as he lays on top of his own corpse. As the mourners start to leave the graveside,sheriff Walt Perry (Troy Evans) arrives to talk to Frank. Apart from Lucy, he was the last person to see Ray alive and he wants to know what condition he seemed to be in when he saw him. He says that the FBI are becoming very concerned about the amount of deaths that are happening in the town - many of the victims are healthy and have clean arteries when the autopsy has taken place but their hearts look as though they have been squeezed. Frank tries to get rid of Walt by pretending that he wants to pay his respects to Ray, in order to pull Ray\u0027s spirit out of his grave. Walt is alarmed to see Frank physically grappling with thin air and seemingly talking to nothing. As Frank and Ray get ready to leave, an emotional Lucy approaches and tells Frank that she believes in his paranormal gifts. He tells her that he has in fact communicated with Ray.Frank has dinner with Lucy and the deceased Ray at the Excalibur themed restaurant and acts as a communicator between the two of them. But Ray becomes increasingly frustrated as his wife seems to start bonding with Frank throughout the evening. She asks him why he can see spirits and Frank tells her that he was in a car accident five years earlier and sometimes a traumatic experience can alter a person\u0027s perception. Lucy opens up too.

Thrilled that he can now use make physical contact with the real world, Ray threatens Frank and disappears. Frank goes to the bathroom to dry his trousers. A man enters and Frank is shocked to once again see a glowing number on the man\u0027s head reading 38. Frank becomes increasingly edgy as he sees The Grim Reaper figure appear and kill the man by reaching into his chest and squeezing his heart.

He tries his best to kill it but his car just goes straight through the caped figure and it once again eludes him.FBI agent Milton Dammers (Jeffrey Combs) arrives at the Sheriff\u0027s office to meet Walt and Lucy. He believes that Frank is behind the killings. He tells them about the incident that happened five years earlier when Frank and his wife had the car crash.

The Reaper appears but the officers have their guns pointed at Frank. The Judge appears and shoots The Reaper and it disappears. Cyrus and Stuart start to make people scared in the museum in order to cause a diversion for Frank to get away. In the commotion, Frank punches Magda and knocks her out, in order to carry her out to his car to safety. He drives away but The Reaper is in pursuit and forces Frank to crash his car in the vicinity where Debra died years earlier. Magda crawls from the car trying to escape from Frank who she believes to be psychotic. Frank tries to get her to listen to him but he is dazed and confused as the Reaper plunges towards her and crushes her heart. Frank jumps towards it but it disappears again and he is lying face down on her corpse. The gateway to Heaven opens and Magda\u0027s spirit jumps from her body and accuses of Frank of being a sick murderer who is responsible for her and his wife\u0027s death.Frank arrives at the sheriff\u0027s office and tells them what has happened. When Walt asks him if he had anything to do with Magda\u0027s death, he doesn\u0027t answer and he is arrested on suspicion of murder. Lucy doesn\u0027t believe it and storms out as Frank is taken through to the interrogation room followed by Dammers.(Director\u0027s cut) Lucy goes out to her car and sits inside trying to get her head around things. Ray appears on the back seat - his spirit now decaying from dripping ectoplasm.Dammers and Walt are sat in the interrogation room with Frank who looks demoralized.

Frank tells Dammers that he is not a murderer and that he can communicate with the other side. He has seen the figure of Death killing people by reaching into their chests but Dammers doesn\u0027t believe any of it and believes Frank to be responsible for the crimes.(Director\u0027s cut) Cyrus and Stuart walk into the sheriff\u0027s and start to walk through the walls of the cells to find Frank. They eventually get to his cell and try to talk to him but Frank is silent. Cyrus tells Stuart that he can\u0027t even see them anymore. He\u0027s so traumatised he\u0027s stopped believing. Dammers looks through the narrow opening of the prison door observing Frank. He tells the deputy that he doesn\u0027t even expect him to make it until the trial. He\u0027s expecting him to commit suicide.Lucy goes to Frank\u0027s house to see if she can find any evidence to clear his name. As she wanders around, Ray is looking too.(Director\u0027s cut) Ray sees on the fridge some labels describing the layout of his and Lucy\u0027s house. He realises that Frank was using his psychic abilities to con them. One of the sticky labels gets stuck to his fingers.He tries to shake it off and as he does, Lucy sees it floating towards the back garden in the wind.She walks outside and sees a nice looking garden, which Frank has made in memory of his wife in place of the basketball court. The phone rings and the answering machine picks up the message. It\u0027s Old Mrs.Bradley trying to tell Frank about her fears for her daughter Patricia. Lucy believes the mother to be dangerous and after hearing her message, heads over to their house.She hides in the bushes outside as the old lady walks out to get rid of the garbage bags. She sneaks inside, looking for Patricia. Ray walks to the house and because of his abilities the house transforms into a weird shape from his point of view. He can sense there is danger lurking inside. Patricia is at the top of the stairs and tells Lucy they need to hide. As her mother walks back in, the two of them rush into her bedroom. Lucy tells Patricia that she needs to get away and start a new life for herself. She sees an urn on the side. They are Patricia\u0027s father\u0027s ashes. He had killed himself after discovering that Patricia had been involved with a serial killer. She hears her mum coming up the stairs and tells Lucy to hide in the wardrobe. She just gets inside as her mother enters. Patricia offers to make her a cup of tea and they walk out. Lucy finds a Stanley knife in the wardrobe with the initials F.B. She realises that it\u0027s Frank\u0027s that Dammers had told her had gone missing after Debra\u0027s death. Lucy slowly walks down the stairs to sneak out. The Urn starts to glow and a figure appears in the wall behind Lucy trying to sneak up. Lucy, oblivious to the threat, rushes out of the house as Ray walks in to try and protect her. His face is sliced off by the figure\u0027s hand and as Lucy gets into her car, Ray\u0027s deformed spirit is tossed onto the hood of the car.Lucy goes to see Frank in his cell and tells him that Old Mrs. Bradley must be responsible for Debra\u0027s death. She\u0027s found his knife in her bedroom and she\u0027s crazy enough to do something like that. Frank is still in a quiet, depressed state. He hugs Lucy and he sees Cyrus and Stuart enter the room. But as he looks Lucy in the face, the number 41 glows on her forehead. He realises she is the next victim. The Reaper appears through the cell door and tries to kill her. With the help of Stuart and Cyrus, he tries to protect her in the confines of the cell. Lucy shouts for the deputy to come and unlock the door. Stuart is dissolved by the Reaper\u0027s sythe. As Frank hears the cell door unlock, he kicks the door into the deputy\u0027s head and knocks him out, so that he can escape with Lucy. Dammers walks around the corner and draws his gun. Lucy rushes up to him and tells him that Frank is crazy, as Cyrus battles the Reaper. Lucy uses a fire extinguisher to spray at Dammers to protect Frank. Cyrus\u0027s soul is taken by the Reaper and Frank takes Dammers\u0027s gun and runs out of the precinct with Lucy. He tells her that he must kill himself in order to become a spirit and protect her. He is ready to put a bullet in his head, but she tells him not to and instead helps him have a near death experience by means of hypothermia and using barbiturates to slow his heart rate.At the medical centre, Frank goes to sit in the cryogenics room and waits to slowly die as Lucy gets the equipment prepared to revive him within several minutes. But Dammers appears in the room armed with an uzi machine gun. He thinks Frank deserves to die for his supposed crimes and abducts Lucy to stop her from reviving him. Frank\u0027s spirit emerges from his dead body and the gateway to Heaven opens for him but he walks away to try and find Lucy. Dammers handcuffs Lucy in the back of one of the sheriff\u0027s cars and drives off. Frank pursues them. As he tries to get used to his abilities, he sees he Reaper rapidly jumping and flying through the town to try and approach Lucy in the car. Just as the Reaper launches onto the roof of the car, Frank flies down and knocks it onto the road. A car zooms down the road and crashes into Frank and smashes him into tiny pieces of ectoplasm. The Reaper approaches him with his scythe as Frank\u0027s spirit moulds back together. A truck approaches and rams straight into the Reaper and it is taken down the road clinging onto the front of the vehicle.Dammers takes Lucy to the graveyard and parks the car up. She desperately wants to get back to the medical centre to revive Frank\u0027s body but he tells her that he is not going to return her for several hours until there\u0027s no chance of Frank coming back. She shouts at him and he starts to freak out again.(Director\u0027s cut) As he tries to cover his ears with his hands, Lucy notices one of his wrists the swastika sign. He tells her that he was undercover with the Manson family for six months disguised as a hippy and he was used as the family\u0027s sex slave.He gets out of the car and walks several yards away and stands in front of the car breathing nervously and uncontrollably. He opens up his shirt and reveals his deeply scarred body.(Director\u0027s cut) He starts to reveal to her his experiences in the many bizarre undercover assignments over the years that he has been part of. All of the weird cults and sects he has had to be involved in, including drinking goat\u0027s blood. He says that he has suffered for his country.He says that the pain he has suffered in the different religious groups has its rewards and tries to prove that he has some psychic sensibilities. He and Lucy are both shocked as the car engine starts up. The gear stick and steering wheel move and Lucy knows that it\u0027s Frank. Frank starts to reverse the car away from Dammers as Dammers chases after it. Sergeant Hiles reaches in through the car window to grab Frank and throws him to the ground. The car crashes into a sarcophagus and coffins fall out. The Reaper approaches and slices Hiles in half with its scythe. Frank uses the sergeant\u0027s machine guns to shoot it. Lucy gets out of the car to get into the driver\u0027s seat and Dammers jumps out to grab her.She uses the skull from a skeleton to hit him and quickly gets in the car and drives off. While Dammers chases after her, Frank rips the Reaper apart with the bullets and turns it into pieces ectoplasm. He grabs the face of the Reaper and as he slams it down onto a grave a few times, the face gradually morphs into a human face and reveals itself to be Johnny Bartlett. He has returned from beyond the grave to continue his killing spree. Spirits start wandering around in the vicinity, all of who appear to be Johnny\u0027s victims satisfied that their deaths have been avenged. A spirit with the number 1 carved in his head approaches Frank and tells him he was a doctor and the first of the victims. He thanks Frank for what he\u0027s done. But while Frank is distracted, the pieces of Johnny\u0027s ectoplasm start to drip down into a tomb and gradually morph back together. Frank dives down into the ground and wrestles with him. He picks up the scythe and as he brings down the handle onto the ectoplasmic figure, Johnny\u0027s full human formed spirit is revealed. Frank is just about to destroy him with the scythe but Lucy revives his body with chest plates. He wakes up panting for breath. He tells her that Johnny\u0027s back and that she needs to go and get Patricia out of the house and save her from him.Lucy arrives at the house but her mother tells her that there\u0027s no way her daughter is going anywhere. Lucy confronts her about Frank\u0027s knife in her closet and the old lady angrily storms off upstairs. Patricia runs up after her. Lucy waits in the living room and moments later, Patricia comes back down and says that her mother is going with them. Lucy tells Patricia that Johnny\u0027s ghost has returned and is on the loose. She tells Lucy she knows and that his spirit often visits her. As Lucy stands in the doorway of the living room, Johnny appears behind her threatening to kill her. He says that she and Frank have been causing a lot of problems. Patricia goes to the kitchen and Johnny points to the knives on the wall. He wants to watch her kill Lucy.(Director\u0027s cut) Patricia repeatedly stabs the knife through Johnny\u0027s torso as they both laugh and become increasingly excited by it, almost in an arousing way.Lucy goes upstairs to see if Mrs Bradley is going with them. She sees her bedroom door open a jar and when she opens it she is horrified to see the old lady\u0027s dead body spread out on the bed covered in blood. Patricia pops up behind her and tries to stab her. Lucy tries to shut the door and the blade of the knife goes into it. Lucy punches her and they both grapple to the floor. Lucy gets up and runs out of the door, after she gets the key out of the lock and locks it from the outside. She sits on the landing stairs trying to get over the shock but bullets start exploding through the door. Patricia has got hold of her mother\u0027s pump action shotgun. Lucy tries to run down the stairs but Johnny\u0027s figure appears from under he rug and tries to strangle her. Frank arrives in time to save Lucy. He grabs hold of the rug and throws Johnny off of the landing. Patricia gets out of the bedroom firing at them maniacally. Frank and Lucy get into Patricia\u0027s bedroom and Johnny appears in the room through the portrait of her father. He tries to kill Lucy once again but Frank smashes the portrait onto the bed post and Johnny\u0027s spirit cries out as he is sucked into the urn on the bedside table. Frank puts the lid on and sees Johnny\u0027s name on the urn. He tells Lucy that they need to get to a chapel and get the ashes to the \"other side\". Realising that there\u0027s a chapel in the old psychiatric (now derelict) hospital, which is located just behind the Bradley house, the pair head off there on foot.They make their way into the murky looking building and walk through the hallways looking for the chapel. Patricia follows them armed. As Frank looks around, he starts to have psychic episodes where he is able to see the events that transpired on the fateful day when Johnny and Patricia went on their killing spree. He sees Johnny pushing a trolley around and he uncovers a gun and blows away the doctor who thanked Frank in the graveyard. He sees the teenage Patricia walking around with a knife ready to carve into the victims\u0027 foreheads. Through his flashbacks, Frank hears one of the doctors say that the chapel is on the fourth floor.Still believing Frank to be the murderer, Dammers enters the hospital. Frank and Lucy are forced to split up when Patricia appears in the hallways and starts shooting at them both again. Lucy has the urn but Dammers gets hold of her and throws her head into the wall. Lucy punches him and gets away from him and manages to get into the elevator before he can reach her. She starts going up to the fourth floor but it breaks down. Frank is still running upstairs and comes across the chapel. He hears Lucy cry. He tries to pry the elevator door open to no avail but she manages to pass him the urn through the door to take to the chapel.Frank puts the urn down to smash the door in but as he turns around he bumps into a statue of the Virgin Mary and it falls onto the table and sends the urn flying to the other side of the hall. Dammers catches it. Frank angrily and desperately asks for it back but Dammers opens it and releases Johnny\u0027s ashes. His spirit laughs as the dust breezes away. Frank picks up a metal bar ready to give Dammers a beating but Dammers pulls out a machine gun and shoots him in the arm. Facing away from him and holding his bloody arm, Frank sees Patricia walk around the corner in the distance ready to shoot him with the shotgun. Dammers orders him to turn around. Frank does and falls backwards as Patricia fires and the bullet blows Dammers\u0027s head off. Frank crashes through four wooden floors down onto the ground floor. Patricia starts to shoot at Lucy in the elevator. She avoids the bullets,and the elevator starts automatically going again. Bloodied, bruised and half unconscious, Frank starts to crawl along the floor of the vivisection room.(Director\u0027s cut) In his psychic flashbacks, Frank sees Johnny chasing the teenage Patricia around dead bodies as she screams \"please don\u0027t hurt me\". As they have a playful game of chase, covered in blood. He grabs her and they start making out on the coroner\u0027s trolley.Lucy makes it to the ground floor and rushes to Frank. But Frank is nearly unconscious. Patricia appears behind her and hits her over the head with the butt of the gun. Frank flashes back to the moment when his wife Debra died and he finally remembers exactly what happened in that moment. He sees The Reaper transform into Johnny as he\u0027s stood over his wife\u0027s body and Patricia is holding his Stanley knife.Patricia points the shotgun at Frank, ready to kill him but she is out of bullets. She kicks him and lifts him up off of the floor with the gun around his neck. Lucy tries to help but Johnny is pinning her down. Frank struggles with Patricia but Patricia has the advantage and she strangles him to death. Frank\u0027s dead body drops to the floor, as Lucy cries out. Johnny excitedly waits for Patricia to take Lucy\u0027s life as well. She picks up an axe from the vivisection area ready but Frank\u0027s spirit jumps out at her and rips Patricia\u0027s spirit from her body and takes her through the tunnel to the \"other side\". Johnny chases him up through the tunnel of light, and as they get half way through, he manages to pull her away from Frank\u0027s grasp. Frank carries on floating towards Heaven, as Johnny and Patricia stay hovering in the middle of the tunnel. He shouts to Frank that they\u0027re returning to Earth to get some more victims. Frank is just about to leap down after them but a voice stops him. It\u0027s Cyrus with Stuart. Frank looks down at Johnny and Patricia as their laughing turns to fear and panic. The spiritual looking, electric like portal gradually turns into the inside of a huge worm, with dozens and dozens of smaller worms wrapping themselves around them,strangling them and gouging out their eyes. The huge worm swallows them up and takes them down into the burning flames of Hell. Frank watches in disbelief and turns around to have a look around Heaven. Cyrus and Stuart tell him that it\u0027s really something. Frank sees his wife Debra approach him smiling. She tells him it\u0027s time to go home. The higher powers have said that it\u0027s not his time to die yet. Cyrus pushes him and he starts to float along the clouds. He wakes up in the derelict hospital in Lucy\u0027s arms.He demolishes his old house in order to start a new life with Lucy. Walt pulls up and tells Frank that the investigation is over. They found a stash of Ouija boards at the house and Patricia was using them to bring Johnny back from the dead. Her mother was trying to do her best to keep her sedated but there was no chance of her stopping Johnny. As Walt gets into his car and drives off, Frank sees the ghost of Dammers in the back seat. To his surprise Lucy can see him as well. She says to Frank \"sometimes when you\u0027ve had a traumatic experience it can alter your perception\". Then Lucy uses a blanket to imitate the Reaper and laughingly chases Frank as the movie ends.","numvotes":"87002","primarytitle":"The Frighteners"},"color":"rgb(117,90,85)","size":1.0},{"source":"Fantasy","target":"tt0118604","id":"7112","attributes":{"productioncompany":"Hollywood Pictures","countriesoforigin":"United Kingdom, Netherlands, Luxembourg, United States, France, Germany","averagerating":"5.1","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"An American Werewolf in Paris","storyline":"The daughter of the werewolf from AWIL is alive and living in Paris where her mother (from the first film) and stepfather are trying to overcome her lycanthropic disease.

The Director\u0027s cut runs 14 minutes longer and this synopsis caters for both versions.A thunderstorm filled, rainy night in the small town of Fairwater. A woman called Patricia Bradley (Dee Wallace) is been chased by a mysterious entity around the old-looking house in which she lives with her mother (Julianna Mcarthy). Patricia is screaming and fearing for her life. Her mother appears from her bedroom with a pump action shotgun and shoots the mysterious figure as its shape appears through the carpet at the top of the stairs.Some of the residents of Fairwater are gathering for a funeral in the community as the local newspaper editor Magda Rees Jones (Elizabeth Hawthorne) and her assistant are reporting the story of another seemingly innocent death amongst the residents. Psychic investigator Frank Bannister (Michael Andrew Fox) arrives at the funeral trying desperately to advertise his services. As he leaves in his wrecked and dirty looking Volkswagen, his reckless driving causes him to nearly hit an on-coming truck. As he swerves to miss it, he crashes straight through a garden fence. Ray Lynskey (Peter Dobson) comes out of his house infuriated and threatens to sue him for the damages. Frank gives him his business card and drives off after deliberately driving over one of Ray\u0027s garden gnomes.On the other side of town Ray\u0027s wife Doctor Lucy Lynskey (Trini Alvarado), visits the Bradley house to treat Patricia\u0027s cuts. She bandages her hand and tells her that she needs to take her to hospital but her mother (Julianna McCarthy) refuses to let her go. She tells her that she never leaves the house and to just give her some antibiotics. Lucy notices how timid and fragile Patricia is and as she gets ready to leave, she notices some bruising around her neck. Patricia\u0027s mother rushes Lucy out of the house and tells her that her daughter is not to be trusted. She was involved in cold-blooded murder.Becoming intrigued by Patricia\u0027s history, Lucy watches a documentary about the notorious serial killer Johnny Bartlett (Jake Busey).\"In the space of 27 blood-soaked minutes, 12 innocent people gunned down by hospital orderly John Charles Bartlett. Patients, medical staff, visitors, no one was spared in this madman\u0027s rampage through Fairwater Sanatorium.Not even the hospital chapel provided sanctuary,as those in prayer were gunned down on their knees. A seemingly senseless crime, Bartlett\u0027s motive remains a mystery to this day. Six years earlier Charles Starkweather had murdered 11 people in a Nebraska killing spree\".The black and white footage shows the horrific scenes at the hospital of the victims and the families, as well as the footage of Bartlett being escorted to court by the police boasting about his disgusting act.\"Fifteen year-old Patricia Ann Bradley, daughter of the hospital administrator, was also implicated in the killings. She was madly in love with the psychopath Bartlett. 2,200 volts of electricity ended the life of Johnny Bartlett, the unrepented killer. As they threw the switch he was heard to scream: I got me a score of twelve. Beat that!\" In what some consider a miscarriage of justice, Patricia Ann Bradley was sentenced to life imprisonment although it was never proven that she actively participated in the killings. Five years ago, Patricia Bradley was granted a conditional release by the State Governor. Today she lives a reclusive life back in the family home\"....Ray gets sick of listening to it and switches off the TV. He joins Lucy on the bed.(Director\u0027s cut) He tells her that he\u0027s booked their most favorite table at the Excalibur themed restaurant for their wedding anniversary.He starts to kiss her ,but he sees Frank\u0027s card that he\u0027s positive he tore up and the bed starts rocking and shaking with Lucy on it. It hovers up in the air as the couple panic. Objects start flying everywhere in the kitchen.Lucy calls Frank and he arrives to rid the house of the supernatural. Instead of charging the couple,he offers to do it in return for not having to pay for the damaged fence.Ray reluctantly agrees and Frank uses his \"equipment\" to capture the spooks and pours them down the sink. As he is packing his stuff up,he is shocked to see a glowing number 37 on Ray\u0027s forehead. Lucy cannot see this and Ray kicks Frank out of the house.Frank arrives at his home to his half-built house that he hasn\u0027t finished working on. As he gets out of is car,a spirit exits the trunk - a young, 1950\u0027s nerd called Stuart (Jim Fyfe), followed by a 1970\u0027s, afro-haired ghost called Cyrus (Chi Mcbride). The ghosts are Frank\u0027s associates who help him con the local residents by haunting their homes, so that Frank can step in and reap the rewards. While Stuart is just about to join them in the house, Frank closes the door and he gets stuck because his ectoplasm has become too stiff. Frank asks them if they had anything to do with the glowing number appearing on Ray\u0027s head but the spirits don\u0027t know what he\u0027s talking about.(Director\u0027s cut) Cyrus helps pull Stuart through the door.

As they are talking, gunshots go off, as another spirit, a judge from the 1800\u0027s (John Astin) enters the room trying to shoot the ghost dog Rhustler as he gnaws on his jawbone. Frank gets his jaw back and tells him to put his guns away.(Director\u0027s cut) Frank cuts some wood off from the roof of his house for his fireplace.He sits looking through the newspaper, trying to find people that have recently lost family, while The Judge contemplates going off into the graveyard to rest his decrepit body.

The figure moves in close to him but it is only Cyrus and Stuart underneath a cape. They tell him they are trying to figure out different ways to scare people but Frank isn\u0027t amused and walks off angry. The next morning Frank receives a letter from his bank informing him that he owes $16,000 dollars. He needs some money fast and he calls the spirits for a meeting demanding that they up their antics to really frighten people.Cyrus and Stuart arrive at a rich woman\u0027s house and start causing fear by picking up the resident\u0027s babies and scaring the mother and her maid as they see the babies hovering through the air. Again they leave one of Frank\u0027s business cards. Frank gets the phone call and sets off.(Director\u0027s cut) Frank is trying to drive to the house as fast as he can but he keeps getting stuck in traffic because the roads are blocked with funeral cars. The Judge is sat in the passenger\u0027s seat and tells him that there is something very sinister dawning over Fairwater. But Frank isn\u0027t interested in what he\u0027s saying.He impatiently and recklessly pulls out into the line of funeral cars and dodges around the traffic. He pulls up outside the house and tells Judge to wait for him.Frank walks into the house and attempts to pull off his scheme but the woman is not interested. She has in her hand the local newspaper which shows a picture of Frank with the headline \"Local conman haunts cemetery\". Frank is angry. He confronts Magda Rees Jones at the local Gazette about printing the story but she tells him he is a parasite who makes money off of the bereaved and she has every right to let people know about him. He leaves and he sees that another funeral is taking place.He sees Lucy in one of the cars crying. As he walks off down the street he is shocked to see Ray running towards him. But not in human form. Ray is now dead. His spirit runs straight into him. Ray is panicking and can\u0027t understand how he\u0027s died so young and fit. He tells Frank that just before he died he felt his heart been crushed while he was working out. Frank tries to explain the rules of the afterlife to him. Ray asks Frank to give him a ride to his funeral.(Director\u0027s cut) As Frank pulls up to the graveyard in his car, Ray (not yet used to being a spirit) has trouble grabbing hold of the door handle to get out. Frank pushes him through the car door and he lands on the ground.They walk through the graveyard and Ray is petrified as he witnesses many spirits roaming the grounds. Drill Sergeant Hiles (R.Lee Ermey), the watchful spirit of the other ghosts, walks out of his tomb and orders the ghosts to get back in their graves. Frank knows there will be trouble. He tells Ray to go on ahead while he talks to the angry sergeant. The two have a fight but with Hiles\u0027s supernatural abilities, Frank has no chance.While Hiles shouts to tell the inhbitants of the graveyard who\u0027s in charge, Frank goes off to join Ray at his funeral. As Ray becomes very emotional at his tragic death, he falls into the grave as he tries to put his arms around Lucy. He is horrified as he lays on top of his own corpse. As the mourners start to leave the graveside,sheriff Walt Perry (Troy Evans) arrives to talk to Frank. Apart from Lucy, he was the last person to see Ray alive and he wants to know what condition he seemed to be in when he saw him. He says that the FBI are becoming very concerned about the amount of deaths that are happening in the town - many of the victims are healthy and have clean arteries when the autopsy has taken place but their hearts look as though they have been squeezed. Frank tries to get rid of Walt by pretending that he wants to pay his respects to Ray, in order to pull Ray\u0027s spirit out of his grave. Walt is alarmed to see Frank physically grappling with thin air and seemingly talking to nothing. As Frank and Ray get ready to leave, an emotional Lucy approaches and tells Frank that she believes in his paranormal gifts. He tells her that he has in fact communicated with Ray.Frank has dinner with Lucy and the deceased Ray at the Excalibur themed restaurant and acts as a communicator between the two of them. But Ray becomes increasingly frustrated as his wife seems to start bonding with Frank throughout the evening. She asks him why he can see spirits and Frank tells her that he was in a car accident five years earlier and sometimes a traumatic experience can alter a person\u0027s perception. Lucy opens up too. She tells Frank that her and Ray\u0027s marriage was not a happy one and just as Frank tries to console her by grabbing her hand, Ray angrily knocks over a glass of wine into Frank\u0027s lap. Thrilled that he can now use make physical contact with the real world, Ray threatens Frank and disappears. Frank goes to the bathroom to dry his trousers. A man enters and Frank is shocked to once again see a glowing number on the man\u0027s head reading 38. Frank becomes increasingly edgy as he sees The Grim Reaper figure appear and kill the man by reaching into his chest and squeezing his heart. The man\u0027s corpse drops to the floor and Frank watches as the gateway to Heaven opens up and the man\u0027s spirit goes off to the other side. Frank rushes out of the restaurant and pursues The Reaper.Lucy is escorted to the Sheriff\u0027s office by one of Sheriff Perry\u0027s deputies as a witness to the situation. Walt is told that witnesses saw Frank rushing out of the restaurant before the dead man was found. He tells his men to bring Frank in.Frank chases the Reaper in his car with Stuart, Cyrus and The Judge. He tries his best to kill it but his car just goes straight through the caped figure and it once again eludes him.FBI agent Milton Dammers (Jeffrey Combs) arrives at the Sheriff\u0027s office to meet Walt and Lucy. He believes that Frank is behind the killings. He tells them about the incident that happened five years earlier when Frank and his wife had the car crash. They discovered that Debra\u0027s dead body was found 15 yards from the car with a number 13 carved in her forehead and after the body was found, Frank was picked up wandering the forest claiming to have no recollection of the incident.Frank tracks down The Reaper at the museum where the 39th life has been taken. Frank sees on Magda Reese-Jones\u0027s forehead a number 40 glowing. She is going to be the next target. He tries to warn her but two deputy sheriffs arrive to arrest him. The Reaper appears but the officers have their guns pointed at Frank. The Judge appears and shoots The Reaper and it disappears. Cyrus and Stuart start to make people scared in the museum in order to cause a diversion for Frank to get away. In the commotion, Frank punches Magda and knocks her out, in order to carry her out to his car to safety. He drives away but The Reaper is in pursuit and forces Frank to crash his car in the vicinity where Debra died years earlier. Magda crawls from the car trying to escape from Frank who she believes to be psychotic. Frank tries to get her to listen to him but he is dazed and confused as the Reaper plunges towards her and crushes her heart. Frank jumps towards it but it disappears again and he is lying face down on her corpse. The gateway to Heaven opens and Magda\u0027s spirit jumps from her body and accuses of Frank of being a sick murderer who is responsible for her and his wife\u0027s death.Frank arrives at the sheriff\u0027s office and tells them what has happened. When Walt asks him if he had anything to do with Magda\u0027s death, he doesn\u0027t answer and he is arrested on suspicion of murder. Lucy doesn\u0027t believe it and storms out as Frank is taken through to the interrogation room followed by Dammers.(Director\u0027s cut) Lucy goes out to her car and sits inside trying to get her head around things. Ray appears on the back seat - his spirit now decaying from dripping ectoplasm.Dammers and Walt are sat in the interrogation room with Frank who looks demoralized. Dammers calls him a dangerous man but Walt refuses to believe that Frank is behind the murders. Dammers uses his power of authority to tell Walt to get out of the room while he questions Frank. Frank tells Dammers that he is not a murderer and that he can communicate with the other side. He has seen the figure of Death killing people by reaching into their chests but Dammers doesn\u0027t believe any of it and believes Frank to be responsible for the crimes.(Director\u0027s cut) Cyrus and Stuart walk into the sheriff\u0027s and start to walk through the walls of the cells to find Frank. They eventually get to his cell and try to talk to him but Frank is silent. Cyrus tells Stuart that he can\u0027t even see them anymore. He\u0027s so traumatised he\u0027s stopped believing. Dammers looks through the narrow opening of the prison door observing Frank. He tells the deputy that he doesn\u0027t even expect him to make it until the trial. He\u0027s expecting him to commit suicide.Lucy goes to Frank\u0027s house to see if she can find any evidence to clear his name. As she wanders around, Ray is looking too.(Director\u0027s cut) Ray sees on the fridge some labels describing the layout of his and Lucy\u0027s house. He realises that Frank was using his psychic abilities to con them. One of the sticky labels gets stuck to his fingers.He tries to shake it off and as he does, Lucy sees it floating towards the back garden in the wind.She walks outside and sees a nice looking garden, which Frank has made in memory of his wife in place of the basketball court. The phone rings and the answering machine picks up the message. It\u0027s Old Mrs.Bradley trying to tell Frank about her fears for her daughter Patricia. Lucy believes the mother to be dangerous and after hearing her message, heads over to their house.She hides in the bushes outside as the old lady walks out to get rid of the garbage bags. She sneaks inside, looking for Patricia. Ray walks to the house and because of his abilities the house transforms into a weird shape from his point of view. He can sense there is danger lurking inside. Patricia is at the top of the stairs and tells Lucy they need to hide. As her mother walks back in, the two of them rush into her bedroom. Lucy tells Patricia that she needs to get away and start a new life for herself. She sees an urn on the side. They are Patricia\u0027s father\u0027s ashes. He had killed himself after discovering that Patricia had been involved with a serial killer. She hears her mum coming up the stairs and tells Lucy to hide in the wardrobe. She just gets inside as her mother enters. Patricia offers to make her a cup of tea and they walk out. Lucy finds a Stanley knife in the wardrobe with the initials F.B. She realises that it\u0027s Frank\u0027s that Dammers had told her had gone missing after Debra\u0027s death. Lucy slowly walks down the stairs to sneak out. The Urn starts to glow and a figure appears in the wall behind Lucy trying to sneak up. Lucy, oblivious to the threat, rushes out of the house as Ray walks in to try and protect her. His face is sliced off by the figure\u0027s hand and as Lucy gets into her car, Ray\u0027s deformed spirit is tossed onto the hood of the car.Lucy goes to see Frank in his cell and tells him that Old Mrs. Bradley must be responsible for Debra\u0027s death. She\u0027s found his knife in her bedroom and she\u0027s crazy enough to do something like that. Frank is still in a quiet, depressed state. He hugs Lucy and he sees Cyrus and Stuart enter the room. But as he looks Lucy in the face, the number 41 glows on her forehead. He realises she is the next victim. The Reaper appears through the cell door and tries to kill her. With the help of Stuart and Cyrus, he tries to protect her in the confines of the cell. Lucy shouts for the deputy to come and unlock the door. Stuart is dissolved by the Reaper\u0027s sythe. As Frank hears the cell door unlock, he kicks the door into the deputy\u0027s head and knocks him out, so that he can escape with Lucy. Dammers walks around the corner and draws his gun. Lucy rushes up to him and tells him that Frank is crazy, as Cyrus battles the Reaper. Lucy uses a fire extinguisher to spray at Dammers to protect Frank. Cyrus\u0027s soul is taken by the Reaper and Frank takes Dammers\u0027s gun and runs out of the precinct with Lucy. He tells her that he must kill himself in order to become a spirit and protect her. He is ready to put a bullet in his head, but she tells him not to and instead helps him have a near death experience by means of hypothermia and using barbiturates to slow his heart rate.At the medical centre, Frank goes to sit in the cryogenics room and waits to slowly die as Lucy gets the equipment prepared to revive him within several minutes. But Dammers appears in the room armed with an uzi machine gun. He thinks Frank deserves to die for his supposed crimes and abducts Lucy to stop her from reviving him. Frank\u0027s spirit emerges from his dead body and the gateway to Heaven opens for him but he walks away to try and find Lucy. Dammers handcuffs Lucy in the back of one of the sheriff\u0027s cars and drives off. Frank pursues them. As he tries to get used to his abilities, he sees he Reaper rapidly jumping and flying through the town to try and approach Lucy in the car. Just as the Reaper launches onto the roof of the car, Frank flies down and knocks it onto the road. A car zooms down the road and crashes into Frank and smashes him into tiny pieces of ectoplasm. The Reaper approaches him with his scythe as Frank\u0027s spirit moulds back together. A truck approaches and rams straight into the Reaper and it is taken down the road clinging onto the front of the vehicle.Dammers takes Lucy to the graveyard and parks the car up. She desperately wants to get back to the medical centre to revive Frank\u0027s body but he tells her that he is not going to return her for several hours until there\u0027s no chance of Frank coming back. She shouts at him and he starts to freak out again.(Director\u0027s cut) As he tries to cover his ears with his hands, Lucy notices one of his wrists the swastika sign. He tells her that he was undercover with the Manson family for six months disguised as a hippy and he was used as the family\u0027s sex slave.He gets out of the car and walks several yards away and stands in front of the car breathing nervously and uncontrollably. He opens up his shirt and reveals his deeply scarred body.(Director\u0027s cut) He starts to reveal to her his experiences in the many bizarre undercover assignments over the years that he has been part of. All of the weird cults and sects he has had to be involved in, including drinking goat\u0027s blood. He says that he has suffered for his country.He says that the pain he has suffered in the different religious groups has its rewards and tries to prove that he has some psychic sensibilities. He and Lucy are both shocked as the car engine starts up. The gear stick and steering wheel move and Lucy knows that it\u0027s Frank. Frank starts to reverse the car away from Dammers as Dammers chases after it. Sergeant Hiles reaches in through the car window to grab Frank and throws him to the ground. The car crashes into a sarcophagus and coffins fall out. The Reaper approaches and slices Hiles in half with its scythe. Frank uses the sergeant\u0027s machine guns to shoot it. Lucy gets out of the car to get into the driver\u0027s seat and Dammers jumps out to grab her.She uses the skull from a skeleton to hit him and quickly gets in the car and drives off. While Dammers chases after her, Frank rips the Reaper apart with the bullets and turns it into pieces ectoplasm. He grabs the face of the Reaper and as he slams it down onto a grave a few times, the face gradually morphs into a human face and reveals itself to be Johnny Bartlett. He has returned from beyond the grave to continue his killing spree. Spirits start wandering around in the vicinity, all of who appear to be Johnny\u0027s victims satisfied that their deaths have been avenged. A spirit with the number 1 carved in his head approaches Frank and tells him he was a doctor and the first of the victims. He thanks Frank for what he\u0027s done. But while Frank is distracted, the pieces of Johnny\u0027s ectoplasm start to drip down into a tomb and gradually morph back together. Frank dives down into the ground and wrestles with him. He picks up the scythe and as he brings down the handle onto the ectoplasmic figure, Johnny\u0027s full human formed spirit is revealed. Frank is just about to destroy him with the scythe but Lucy revives his body with chest plates. He wakes up panting for breath. He tells her that Johnny\u0027s back and that she needs to go and get Patricia out of the house and save her from him.Lucy arrives at the house but her mother tells her that there\u0027s no way her daughter is going anywhere. Lucy confronts her about Frank\u0027s knife in her closet and the old lady angrily storms off upstairs. Patricia runs up after her. Lucy waits in the living room and moments later, Patricia comes back down and says that her mother is going with them. Lucy tells Patricia that Johnny\u0027s ghost has returned and is on the loose. She tells Lucy she knows and that his spirit often visits her. As Lucy stands in the doorway of the living room, Johnny appears behind her threatening to kill her. He says that she and Frank have been causing a lot of problems. Patricia goes to the kitchen and Johnny points to the knives on the wall. He wants to watch her kill Lucy.(Director\u0027s cut) Patricia repeatedly stabs the knife through Johnny\u0027s torso as they both laugh and become increasingly excited by it, almost in an arousing way.Lucy goes upstairs to see if Mrs Bradley is going with them. She sees her bedroom door open a jar and when she opens it she is horrified to see the old lady\u0027s dead body spread out on the bed covered in blood. Patricia pops up behind her and tries to stab her. Lucy tries to shut the door and the blade of the knife goes into it. Lucy punches her and they both grapple to the floor. Lucy gets up and runs out of the door, after she gets the key out of the lock and locks it from the outside. She sits on the landing stairs trying to get over the shock but bullets start exploding through the door. Patricia has got hold of her mother\u0027s pump action shotgun. Lucy tries to run down the stairs but Johnny\u0027s figure appears from under he rug and tries to strangle her. Frank arrives in time to save Lucy. He grabs hold of the rug and throws Johnny off of the landing. Patricia gets out of the bedroom firing at them maniacally. Frank and Lucy get into Patricia\u0027s bedroom and Johnny appears in the room through the portrait of her father. He tries to kill Lucy once again but Frank smashes the portrait onto the bed post and Johnny\u0027s spirit cries out as he is sucked into the urn on the bedside table. Frank puts the lid on and sees Johnny\u0027s name on the urn. He tells Lucy that they need to get to a chapel and get the ashes to the \"other side\". Realising that there\u0027s a chapel in the old psychiatric (now derelict) hospital, which is located just behind the Bradley house, the pair head off there on foot.They make their way into the murky looking building and walk through the hallways looking for the chapel. Patricia follows them armed. As Frank looks around, he starts to have psychic episodes where he is able to see the events that transpired on the fateful day when Johnny and Patricia went on their killing spree. He sees Johnny pushing a trolley around and he uncovers a gun and blows away the doctor who thanked Frank in the graveyard. He sees the teenage Patricia walking around with a knife ready to carve into the victims\u0027 foreheads. Through his flashbacks, Frank hears one of the doctors say that the chapel is on the fourth floor.Still believing Frank to be the murderer, Dammers enters the hospital. Frank and Lucy are forced to split up when Patricia appears in the hallways and starts shooting at them both again. Lucy has the urn but Dammers gets hold of her and throws her head into the wall. Lucy punches him and gets away from him and manages to get into the elevator before he can reach her. She starts going up to the fourth floor but it breaks down. Frank is still running upstairs and comes across the chapel. He hears Lucy cry. He tries to pry the elevator door open to no avail but she manages to pass him the urn through the door to take to the chapel.Frank puts the urn down to smash the door in but as he turns around he bumps into a statue of the Virgin Mary and it falls onto the table and sends the urn flying to the other side of the hall. Dammers catches it. Frank angrily and desperately asks for it back but Dammers opens it and releases Johnny\u0027s ashes. His spirit laughs as the dust breezes away. Frank picks up a metal bar ready to give Dammers a beating but Dammers pulls out a machine gun and shoots him in the arm. Facing away from him and holding his bloody arm, Frank sees Patricia walk around the corner in the distance ready to shoot him with the shotgun. Dammers orders him to turn around. Frank does and falls backwards as Patricia fires and the bullet blows Dammers\u0027s head off. Frank crashes through four wooden floors down onto the ground floor. Patricia starts to shoot at Lucy in the elevator. She avoids the bullets,and the elevator starts automatically going again. Bloodied, bruised and half unconscious, Frank starts to crawl along the floor of the vivisection room.(Director\u0027s cut) In his psychic flashbacks, Frank sees Johnny chasing the teenage Patricia around dead bodies as she screams \"please don\u0027t hurt me\". As they have a playful game of chase, covered in blood. He grabs her and they start making out on the coroner\u0027s trolley.Lucy makes it to the ground floor and rushes to Frank. But Frank is nearly unconscious. Patricia appears behind her and hits her over the head with the butt of the gun. Frank flashes back to the moment when his wife Debra died and he finally remembers exactly what happened in that moment. He sees The Reaper transform into Johnny as he\u0027s stood over his wife\u0027s body and Patricia is holding his Stanley knife.Patricia points the shotgun at Frank, ready to kill him but she is out of bullets. She kicks him and lifts him up off of the floor with the gun around his neck. Lucy tries to help but Johnny is pinning her down. Frank struggles with Patricia but Patricia has the advantage and she strangles him to death. Frank\u0027s dead body drops to the floor, as Lucy cries out. Johnny excitedly waits for Patricia to take Lucy\u0027s life as well. She picks up an axe from the vivisection area ready but Frank\u0027s spirit jumps out at her and rips Patricia\u0027s spirit from her body and takes her through the tunnel to the \"other side\". Johnny chases him up through the tunnel of light, and as they get half way through, he manages to pull her away from Frank\u0027s grasp. Frank carries on floating towards Heaven, as Johnny and Patricia stay hovering in the middle of the tunnel. He shouts to Frank that they\u0027re returning to Earth to get some more victims. Frank is just about to leap down after them but a voice stops him. It\u0027s Cyrus with Stuart. Frank looks down at Johnny and Patricia as their laughing turns to fear and panic. The spiritual looking, electric like portal gradually turns into the inside of a huge worm, with dozens and dozens of smaller worms wrapping themselves around them,strangling them and gouging out their eyes. The huge worm swallows them up and takes them down into the burning flames of Hell. Frank watches in disbelief and turns around to have a look around Heaven. Cyrus and Stuart tell him that it\u0027s really something. Frank sees his wife Debra approach him smiling. She tells him it\u0027s time to go home. The higher powers have said that it\u0027s not his time to die yet. Cyrus pushes him and he starts to float along the clouds. He wakes up in the derelict hospital in Lucy\u0027s arms.He demolishes his old house in order to start a new life with Lucy. Walt pulls up and tells Frank that the investigation is over. They found a stash of Ouija boards at the house and Patricia was using them to bring Johnny back from the dead. Her mother was trying to do her best to keep her sedated but there was no chance of her stopping Johnny. As Walt gets into his car and drives off, Frank sees the ghost of Dammers in the back seat. To his surprise Lucy can see him as well. She says to Frank \"sometimes when you\u0027ve had a traumatic experience it can alter your perception\". Then Lucy uses a blanket to imitate the Reaper and laughingly chases Frank as the movie ends.","numvotes":"87002","primarytitle":"The Frighteners"},"color":"rgb(117,90,85)","size":1.0},{"source":"Comedy","target":"tt0118604","id":"7110","attributes":{"productioncompany":"Hollywood Pictures","countriesoforigin":"United Kingdom, Netherlands, Luxembourg, United States, France, Germany","averagerating":"5.1","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"An American Werewolf in Paris","storyline":"The daughter of the werewolf from AWIL is alive and living in Paris where her mother (from the first film) and stepfather are trying to overcome her lycanthropic disease.

When another nun tries to get her to come down, Maureen accidentally pushes her over the railing to her death. Another nun tells Maureen that she will burn in hell for what she did. She is forced to leave the convent after this ordeal.She walks through the desert for a while, and finally reaches a highway. A beat-up car approaches and passes her, but backs up upon seeing her. The driver, Duane Duke (Jeff Fahey) offers her a ride. She puts her suitcase in the backseat and in doing so, bumps his guitar. He tells her to be careful with it, because it is his \"bread and butter\"--he is on his way to Los Angeles to make it big as a rock-n\u0027-roll singer. She says that she\u0027s having car problems, and that the problem is that there is no car.They continue driving into the night during a heavy rainstorm. Duane can barely see ahead of him but keeps on driving aggressively, and the car begins to weave between the lanes. The car is having engine problems, and a loud popping sound causes Duane to swerve the car to the other side of the road. Duane pulls the car off the road, and tells Maureen that they aren\u0027t going any further, due to the storm. He advises her to try to get some sleep. During the middle of the night, it is still raining, and Duane makes a pass at her. She struggles to fight him off, and slaps his face. She gets out of the car, and he angrily tosses her suitcase out into a muddy puddle. Duane drives off, leaving Maureen sobbing.The next morning at the Bates Motel, Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) collects some dead birds in a paper sack from the ground, thanks to some poisoned birdseed he kept in a birdfeeder, and stuffs them in the kitchen using his taxidermy supplies. On the table is a newspaper opened up to an article entitled, \"Spool Still Missing.\" Norman has a flashback of him killing Emma Spool (Claudia Bryar, from the end of Psycho II), and when he looks down at the bird he is stitching up, he instead sees a hand and arm being stitched together! He is startled when the paper sack moves along the tabletop by itself, and is relieved to see a healthy bird pop out. Norman carefully grasps the bird in his hands and releases it outside. He hears a car horn blaring, and comes down to meet Duane. Duane is interested in the \"help wanted\" sign posted on the office window. Norman offers him a job as an assistant manager for the motel, and Duane accepts, mentioning that he only wants to stay long enough to earn money to fix his car to go to L.A.Norman goes off to the diner (Statlers) where he used to work to get some food. At the diner, Ralph Statler (Robert Alan Browne)--the owner--is having a conversation with Sheriff John Hunt (Hugh Gillin) about Emma Spool. He is confused as to why she would suddenly not show up for work a month ago and disappear, after normally being a stellar employee since he took over the diner from the previous owner, Harvey Leach (Hugo L. Stanger) seven years earlier. --Sheriff Hunt says that her apartment has been searched and nothing seems out of the ordinary. Ralph hopes that nothing serious has happened to her, displaying a worried look on his face. Tracy Veneble (Roberta Maxwell), a nosy magazine reporter, chimes in and suggests that Norman may have had something to do with her disappearance. She came from L.A. to interview Norman about the subject of the insanity defense and the rehabilitation of mentally ill murderers.Sheriff Hunt and Ralph argue with her and tell her to leave him alone in peace. Just then, Norman walks in and sits down in a booth. He orders a meal and gets an order of burgers to go. Tracy sits down across from him and starts to ask him some questions. He opens up to her and explains that what happened to him in the past stays with him and he can\u0027t escape the reality of what he did. As they are talking, Maureen gets out of a semi truck and comes into the diner. Norman is horrified to see her initials on her suitcase--\"M.C.\" Norman has a flashback to the murder of Marion Crane from 22 years earlier-he notices that Maureen is almost an exact look-alike to Marion. He pays for the food and quickly leaves while Tracy keeps droning on and on.Back at the motel, Duane sees an exhausted Maureen walking toward the highway. He apologizes to her for his behavior the night before (he says he was road-weary) and offers her a motel room that she can rest in. She pays him $25 for the room, and he gives her the key to cabin #1. As she leaves, Duane keeps the $5 bill she gave him, folds over the edge of one corner, and puts it in his pocket. Norman walks by and sees her going into the room. He freaks out and goes back to the house. Norman has a conversation with \"Mother (Virginia Gregg\u0027s voice),\" the stuffed corpse of Mrs. Spool. He tells \"her\" about Maureen resembling Marion, and \"she\" tells him to get rid of her if her presence upsets him. He refuses, and Mother says that maybe she will do it instead.Maureen unpacks her suitcase in cabin 1. She sees a copy of the Bible on the nightstand, and she has a traumatic memory of her actions at the convent. She starts to cry. In Fairvale, Duane goes into a bar and sees Tracy Veneble. He introduces himself to her and lights her cigarette for her. She initially is turned off by him, but when she sees his Bates Motel matchbook, she decides to have a talk with him.In the motel office parlor, Norman takes a picture off the wall, and looks through a peephole into cabin 1. He sees Maureen stripping and going into the bathroom nude. Norman goes back up to the house and puts on his \"Mother\" costume and goes back to cabin 1 to kill her. Maureen is in the shower, and \"Mother\" pulls back the shower curtain. Maureen is sitting in a tub of rising bloody water. A razor blade sits nearby. She lifts up her hands to reveal that her wrists were slit, with blood gushing out of the wounds. Due to her blood loss, Maureen hallucinates that \"Mother\" is the Virgin Mary coming to save her.Meanwhile, Duane and Tracy continue talking about Norman. Tracy says she will pay Duane for any information he gives her. Unexpectedly, she gets up and leaves. Duane notices a red-haired girl (Juliette Cummins) staring at him.At St. Matthew\u0027s Hospital, Maureen is in a room recovering from her suicide attempt. Father Brian (Gary Bayer), a psychiatrist, is sitting by her bedside and introduces himself to her. Outside her room, Norman and Sheriff Hunt are waiting. Tracy shows up and claims that she happened to be passing by the motel and saw the ambulance leaving and decided to follow it. She asks how Norman found out about Maureen. Sheriff Hunt chimes in and says he was bringing fresh towels to Maureen\u0027s motel room when he found her in the bathtub after she cut her wrists and he used her room phone to call for an ambulance, repeating what Norman had told him. Father Brian comes out and tells Norman that Maureen wants to see him.Maureen thanks Norman for finding her and calling for help. He is just glad that he was looking out for someone else. He tells her that she can stay at the motel for free as long as she wants until she gets better and can sort her life out. He leaves her room to let her rest, and goes back home. He accuses Mother of hurting Maureen, and says that he is glad that Maureen didn\u0027t die. Mother replies, \"She will!\"Duane brings the red-haired girl back to the motel. They overhear Norman yelling at Mother. They just assume the noise is due to a loud TV. Red tries to open the ice chest next to the office to get some ice, but it is locked. She bumps into Norman and falls to the ground. He opens the chest for her and she gets some ice and asks him to join her and Duane; he politely declines.Red and Duane make love, and later she comes out of the shower. She goes over to Duane to kiss some more and he isn\u0027t interested anymore. She is upset because she wants this relationship to be more than just a one-night fling, and he tells her to leave and gives her $5 for cab fare, the same $5 that Maureen used to help pay for cabin #1. He tosses her and her clothes out the door. She puts her clothes on and goes into to a phone booth nearby to call for a cab. She realizes she put her shirt on backward and takes it off to put it back on correctly. Suddenly, Mother\u0027s hand bursts through the glass door, opens it, and stabs her over and over again. Red struggles to fight off Mother\u0027s attack, and she severely cuts the bottoms of her bare feet from stumbling on the glass shards on the floor, blood squishing out. Red crumples to the ground and Mother turns around and leaves. Back at the house, Norman cries, \"Mother! Oh God, Mother! Blood! Blood!\"The next morning, Duane comes out of his cabin and sees Norman scrubbing the glass walls of the phone booth with soapy water. Duane goes into the office and sees that the $5 bill he gave Red for cab fare is in the cash drawer.At the hospital, Maureen is having a counseling session with Father Brian. She tells him that it was her idea to become a nun, but that as the time grew close to take her final vows of celibacy, she became scared and was dwelling on lustful thoughts. Father Brian asks her why she didn\u0027t just leave the novitiate, rather than be tormented by those thoughts.Duane talks to Tracy at the motel about the $5 bill he discovered in the drawer. She tells him it may have helped solve the mystery if he knew the girl\u0027s name. The motel is bustling with activity because Fairvale\u0027s homecoming football game is later in the day, and several guests have checked into rooms. Norman and Maureen arrive in a cab, and he sees Tracy going up to the house. She wants to continue her interview with him, but he stops her and tells her to leave and never come back. Norman goes into cabin 1, and Maureen is pleased to find that Norman had her wet clothes sent to the dry-cleaner\u0027s. He tells her that she\u0027ll look good in her pink dress on their dinner date later on.At Mrs. Spool\u0027s apartment, Tracy talks with the landlord. He says that other than coming and going for work, Mrs. Spool stayed home. The landlord leaves, and Tracy decides to stay and snoop for a while. She glances at some magazines on a coffee table and a single phone number is written on the covers several times. She dials the number on the phone, and she discovers that it connects her to the Bates Motel.That evening, Norman takes Maureen out to eat at a fancy restaurant in Fairview. After eating, they get up to dance. At first, Maureen doesn\u0027t feel comfortable, but Norman teaches her the basic \"box\" step movements.Back at the motel, a cab drops Maureen and Norman off. Maureen goes into her room, and Norman follows soon after. He sees her staring toward the house. He asks her what is wrong, and she says that she must have had too much to drink--she thought she saw a woman up in the window at the house. Uncomfortable, Norman goes to tell Duane that he can take off for the night, and then goes back to Maureen. She tells him she enjoyed her time with him earlier. They lay down on the bed and kiss. Norman stops kissing her, and he says he doesn\u0027t feel right about this. Maureen eases his discomfort by suggesting they just lie on the bed and hold each other.Later that night, Maureen is asleep and Norman is gone. Patsy Boyle (Katt Shea Reuben), a guest from another cabin, comes in to wake her and warns her about the door being left wide open. She tells Maureen that she\u0027ll close it for her, in case one of her drunk friends might happen to wander inside.Up at the house, Mother scolds Norman for letting Maureen come between them. She starts whispering something to him, and he is about to put on the dress and wig. Maureen comes up to the front door and calls out his name. Mother tells him to bring her the knife. He is shocked to see her dead body sit up in bed. Norman takes the knife in his hand, wraps his fingers around the blade, and slams his hand down on a table. He yelps in pain. Concerned, Maureen asks what is wrong. He feigns ill, and tells her to go back to her cabin and lock her door. Soon after, Norman leaves, dressed to kill.Meanwhile, Patsy Boyle is looking for a bathroom to use. She sees the one in the parlor, and sits down on the toilet to relieve herself. Suddenly, she looks up in surprise and sees Mother standing directly in front of her. She tells Mother that the bathroom is \"occupied,\" and Mother thrusts the knife, slitting her throat, and stabbing her in the stomach. Patsy keels over and falls to the floor. Later, Norman goes into the parlor looking for Duane, and he recoils in shock from seeing the bloody mess. Norman takes her body out of the bathroom and tosses it out the window behind the motel. Some partiers are chasing each other around the building, and Norman hides himself and the body momentarily. The guests all get into their cars and leave, burning rubber on their way out to the highway.The next morning, Maureen comes out of her cabin to see the sheriff\u0027s car outside. Worried, she asks about Norman. Tracy is there too, and she decides it\u0027s time to tell Maureen the truth about Norman. Sheriff Hunt and Deputy Leo (Steve Guevara) are investigating the disappearance of Patsy Boyle. She didn\u0027t ride home with the other revelers, and they go up to the house where they question Norman about it. Norman figures that Tracy assumed he was involved. Deputy Leo searches the first floor level, and then goes to search upstairs. Terrified that they\u0027ll discover Mrs. Spool\u0027s corpse, Norman runs up after him, with Sheriff Hunt in pursuit. Norman sees that there is no body in Mother\u0027s room. Bewildered by Norman\u0027s antics, Hunt and Leo leave.Shortly after, Norman is sitting by the ice machine by the motel. Sheriff Hunt apologizes to Norman for their intrusion, and he opens the ice chest to grab a couple of ice cubes to suck on. There are human fingers sticking up out of the ice, but he doesn\u0027t see them. He puts bloody ice cubes in his mouth (he doesn\u0027t notice this-he grabs them without looking at them) and vehemently ignores Tracy\u0027s pleas to take Norman in for questioning about the disappearances of Mrs. Spool and Patsy, because there is no proof that he did anything. Maureen lies to Hunt, and claims that she was with Norman until 6:00 that morning, so he couldn\u0027t have done anything wrong. Hunt and Leo leave, and Tracy waits for Maureen to get in her car--she told her everything about Norman, and Maureen tells a disappointed Norman that she\u0027ll stay with Father Brian for a while. They drive off.Norman looks around the house looking for Mother. She is nowhere to be found. In the kitchen, he sees a note from Mother: \"Norman--I\u0027m in cabin 12. Come see me.\" Norman walks along the front of the motel and approaches cabin 12, which is Duane\u0027s cabin. On the TV is a Woody Woodpecker cartoon. Mother is sitting in front of the TV. On the bed, Duane--high on drugs and alcohol--plays his guitar.\"What are you doing with my mother?\" Norman asks him.Duane replies, \"Don\u0027t you mean, Mummy?\" in a mocking tone. Norman asks him why he took her and left the note for him to find.\"I\u0027m just looking out for you Norman,\" says Duane.\"And yourself,\" Norman says.Duane continues, \"I have ambitions--dreams, but dreams don\u0027t come cheap these days. I could\u0027ve turned \u0027mom\u0027 over to the cops this afternoon, but all I would\u0027ve gotten was a pat on the back for doing my civic duty.\" He tells her that Tracy would\u0027ve payed him a big sum of money, but figures that she would lie and take all the credit and earn a big salary and earn a news position somewhere.Duane blackmails Norman into selling the house and motel in order to give Mother over to Norman. Norman tells him that he wants Mother back. Duane tells him he can take her--Duane says, \"You know what I want, and you know what I\u0027ll do if I don\u0027t get it.\"Norman hits Duane in the head with an ashtray. A violent fight breaks out with Norman hitting Duane with a lamp, and ultimately, hitting Duane with his own guitar. \"Watch the guitar,\" Duane mumbles. Norman hits him with the guitar repeatedly, until the guitar is broken into several pieces. Duane crumples to the floor, unconscious.At the diner, Ralph, Myrna (Lee Garlington)--a waitress, and Tracy are discussing Mrs. Spool. Ralph tells Tracy that Mrs. Spool was a good employee, and was already working there when Ralph bought the place. Tracy asks about the diner\u0027s former owner, Harvey Leach, in the hopes that she can find out more about Mrs. Spool from him. Myrna says that Harvey is in a nursing home outside of town. Tracy visits Harvey, and she asks him about Mrs. Spool. He tells her that Emma had been put in an asylum for killing someone.At Father Brian\u0027s office, Maureen has decided to forgive Norman and wants to be back with him. She has failed other people before, but she won\u0027t fail him.At a library, Tracy looks through old archived newspaper articles, and is shocked to see a headline reading: \"Sister arrested in Bates Murder-Kidnapping.\" Below it is a sub-heading: \"Child Unharmed in Love Triangle Tragedy.\"In Duane\u0027s motel room, Norman removes his belongings and wraps his body in the shower curtain. \"I\u0027ll be back for you mother,\" Norman says. Norman opens the ice chest and tries to remove Patsy\u0027s body from it. One of her arms is wedged against the top of the chest and won\u0027t move, and Norman tries with all his strength to pull it loose, but the arm snaps off. He finally gets the body out of the ice chest, and he kisses her on the lips before putting her in the trunk of Duane\u0027s car. Norman puts Duane\u0027s body in the back seat of the car and drives it over to the swamp. On the way, Duane wakes up and wraps a cord around Norman\u0027s neck. Startled, Norman slams his foot down on the brake pedal and the momentum causes Duane to lurch forward into the front passenger seat.Norman pins Duane down on the floor of the car with his foot, and the other foot accidentally presses down on the gas pedal, sending the car into the swamp. As the car fills with water, Norman sees Duane drowning. Norman manages to escape the flooding car and swims away from it. He struggles to see in the murky water, navigating through underwater weeds. He lets out a scream when he sees Red\u0027s body--her pale, expressionless face staring back at him. He surfaces, and crawls his way out of the swamp.Meanwhile, Tracy shows copies of the newspaper articles to Father Brian, hoping that if Maureen would see them, she could change her story to the police. He tells her Maureen already left and went back to the motel.In her room, Maureen has showered and put on a nightgown. She hears Norman running up the steps to the house, and she calls out to him. He ignores her and runs into the house. She walks up to the house and enters it. As she walks up the staircase, she calls out to Norman again and explains that she has returned. She says that she never should have left and she forgives him for what happened to him in the past, and emphasizes that he saved her life. Norman appears at the top of the stairs. She asks him what happened. He lies and says that he slipped in the mud.She says that she regrets hurting him by leaving, and asks for his forgiveness. They hold each other\u0027s hands and have a brief tender moment. Suddenly, Mother yells, \"Norman!\" Surprised by this, Norman lets go of Maureen\u0027s hands, sending her falling backward down the stairs, arms flailing. At the bottom of the stairs, her skull is pierced by the arrow of the cupid statue against the wall. She crumples to the floor... dead. Norman, in shock, runs down the stairs and sees that blood is pooling around her head. He angrily yells \"Mother!!\" at the top of his lungs.Tracy drives up to the motel, and, carrying a tire iron, checks Maureen\u0027s cabin. She overhears Mother saying to Norman, \"You get that whore out of my house. Throw it out in the muck and filth where she belongs!\" Norman says, \"I\u0027ll get you for this, Mother.\" Mother replies back, \"You haven\u0027t got the guts, boy!\"Tracy goes up to the house and tries to open the front door, but it\u0027s locked. She goes around the back and enters the kitchen. She slowly walks through the hallway into the foyer, and sees the living room lit up with dozens of candles. She sees Maureen\u0027s body laying on the couch, with a lit candle positioned in her grasped hands. With pity, she says, \"You dumb, stupid naive girl.\" She turns around and is shocked to see Norman dressed up as Mother, his mouth fixed in a wide, skeletal smile. \"Why can\u0027t you leave my poor son, my Norman, alone?\" says Mother. Tracy drops the tire iron and tries to escape from him. She begins to go up the stairs, with Norman slowly in pursuit.\"What set you off again, Norman? Was it Mrs. Spool? You killed her, didn\u0027t you? What did she do--come to you and tell you she was your mother? She was crazy, Norman--she wasn\u0027t your mother, and neither are you!\" She reaches the tops of the stairs, Norman still following her. \"Mrs. Spool was your aunt, Norman. She was in love with your father, but your mother stole him away from her! Emma Spool killed your father in a jealous rage and kidnapped you when you were just a baby!\" In Mother\u0027s room, she turns around and lets out a horrified shriek when she sees Mrs. Spool\u0027s corpse sitting in a chair. \"She killed your father because she thought you were her child--the child she should have had with him! She was crazy--they locked her away!\"Mother says, \"It\u0027s lies! It\u0027s all lies! She\u0027s a lying whore. She\u0027s a slut! Don\u0027t let her talk about me like that!\" Norman, seemingly free of Mother\u0027s spell, takes off the wig and dress. \"Get her boy, get her! Just like all the others!\" continues Mother. Norman raises the knife, and it looks as though he is going to attack Tracy, but instead, Norman stabs Mrs. Spool\u0027s body at the neck. \"Norman! Can\u0027t you do anything right?\" says Mother. Norman continues hacking at the neck, with sawdust spraying out. \"How dare you treat your mother that way!\" The corpse slides out of the chair and onto the floor. Norman hacks with the knife until the head is completely severed and rolls to the side. \"So I don\u0027t have the guts, huh?\" taunts Norman. Exhausted, Norman rests his head on the chair.The next morning, Sheriff Hunt leads Norman away from the house in handcuffs. A TV news crew is there filming. Tracy and Father Brian are both in shock. Hunt is in total disbelief with Norman, telling him that he believed in him and had faith in him and now that Norman, as \"Mother\" killed more people.

The woman turns off the radio and begins to take a bath. Suddenly, a gray-haired, wild-eyed man appears in the bathroom and brutally stabs the woman in her left eye, killing her. The man hacks off her left leg with a machete and leaves with it.The next day at the police station, Detective Pete Thornton reviews the latest murder to a homicidal maniac killing nearly five women now, and there are no clues. His chief superior advises him to continue pursuing the case.At Fuad Ramses\u0027 Catering shop, Dorothy Freemont, a wealthy socialite, arrives where she arranges for Fuad to cater a party for her daughter Suzette. Fuad agrees to cater the party for Suzette and tells Mrs. Freemont that what he\u0027s preparing hasn\u0027t been prepared for over 5,000 years. Mrs. Freemont wants the catering done in two weeks and Fuad tells her that it will be enough time to get the last of his ingredients. After Mrs. Freemont leaves, Fuad ventures to the back storage room where he has a large gold statue of the \"mother of veiled darkness\", the goddess Ishtar. Fuad is repairing a blood rite for her in order for the goddesses resurrection. The solution that Fuad mixes in a huge vat contains the parts of the dead women.That evening, two teenagers, Tony and Marcy, make out on a nearby beach when Fuad attacks them, subduing Tony and slicing off the top of Marcy\u0027s head \u0026 removing her brain to serve as the latest ingredient. Pete Thornton arrives on the scene with the police chief where, after not getting much from the distraught Tony, interrogate Marcy\u0027s mother who can only tell Pete that her daughter belonged to a book club.At a local motel, Fuad is staking out the place when he sees a drunken sailor drop his wife off at her room before taking off. Fuad knocks on the woman\u0027s front door to the room and attacks her when she opens the door. Fuad rips the woman\u0027s tongue out of her mouth as another ingredient to his \u0027blood feast\u0027. Pete continues to investigate this latest killing and also discovers that the latest murder victim also belonged to a book club too.Pete attends his weekly Egyptian studies lecture at the local university with his girlfriend, who happens to be Suzette. The lecturer tells them about the Cult of Ishtar, and describes how virginal women were sacrificed on a altar as a blood offering to the Egyptian goddess. When the lecture is over, Pete takes Suzette out for a evening drive where she becomes worried about these events and of a serial killer loose in the area. Their date is interrupted by their car radio which the announcer says that another victim has been found near death. Pete drops Suzette home and races to the hospital where the police chief is there and informs him that the maniac has struck again and hacked off the face of another woman named Janet Blake. Pete questions Janet in her hospital bed, in which the woman, with a bandaged face, tells the detectives that the man who attacked her was old with gray hair, with wild eyes, wearing a funny-looking dark suite, and he said something which sounded like \"Etar\". Janet Blake then dies, while Pete can\u0027t shake the feeling why that word sounds familiar.Fuad receives a letter from Trudy requesting a copy of the book \u0027Ancient Weird Religious Rites\u0027, of which Ramses is the author. Fuad calls Trudy\u0027s home phone number and learns that she\u0027s staying with Suzette. That afternoon, Fuad stakes out the Freemont residence and kidnaps Trudy from the grounds and takes her to his store. He whips her savagely and collects her blood, the last ingredient of his concoction for Ishtar.With Trudy missing, Mrs. Freemont insists that the party continue. Pete calls Suzette to inform her that he will be late in arriving. Meanwhile, Fuad arrives with his food that he bakes at his store. Elsewhere, Pete calls upon the college lecturer and gets more information about the Cult of Ishtar and about the book that Fuad Ramses had wrote and figures out that Fuad is the killer since all the victims were women who personally called upon him to send them copies of his book. Pete and the police race over to Ramses\u0027 store and find Trudy\u0027s mutilated body in the back of the store. Pete tries to call Suzette to warn her, but at coincidentally the same time, Fuad cuts the phone line to the Freemont house.At the Freemont party, Fuad is ready with the food, but he first asks Suzette to come into the kitchen to help him. He has Suzette lie on a counter, which he makes his altar, and say a prayer to Ishtar, as he prepares to stab her in the chest with a butcher knife as a final offering to his goddess. Because she won\u0027t take him seriously, Ramses\u0027 attempt to sacrifice her is delayed. Dorothy Freemont interrupts Fuad just as he\u0027s about to stab Suzette, and Fuad escapes just as the police arrive.Pete and the rest of the police chase Fuad through a nearby garbage dump where Fuad attempts to escape by climbing into the back of a departing garbage truck. The truck\u0027s compact blades suddenly activate and Fuad is crushed to death. The police stop the truck and see there\u0027s not much left of Fuad Ramses as Pete puts it, \"he died a fitting end, just like the garbage he was.\"","numvotes":"6606","primarytitle":"Blood Feast","productioncompany":"Friedman-Lewis Productions","countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"5.0","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"Blood Feast","storyline":"An Egyptian caterer busies himself collecting body parts from young maidens to bring Ishtar, an ancient goddess of good and evil, back to life.

One night, while at a party, Frederic notices a photograph of   some castle ruins near a beach. They look familiar to him, and he recalls   an incident that happened 20 years ago, when he was 12. He was lost. It   was getting dark, and he went to the castle where he was invited in by a   young girl [Annie Briand] dressed all in white. He spent the night there and became   infatuated with her. To thank her for her kindness, Frederic placed a toy   on her steps before he left to go home.When Frederic tells his mother [Natalie Perrey] about the memory, she denies that it   ever happened, so Frederic pays a visit to the photographer to find out   where the photo was taken. The photographer tells him that she\u0027s been paid   not to reveal the location but later relents and tells him to meet her at   midnight at the aquarium and she will tell him then. To kill time,   Frederic goes to the cinema. As he watches the movie, he notices the girl   in white standing in the doorway. He follows her outside. She leads him   into a cemetery and down into a crypt where he finds four coffins. He   opens one of the coffins to find several bats inside.Unknowingly, Frederic has released four vampiresses. Frederic runs   outside where he meets a woman who claims to be the girl he met 20 years   ago in the ruins, even though she looks nothing like her. She leads him to   a room in an old abandoned building. When he asks her to identify the toy   that he left with her 20 years ago, she cannot, confirming Frederic\u0027s   suspicion that she is working for the same people that paid the   photographer to keep quiet. For some reason, they do not want him to find   the girl. Suddenly, the woman bolts from the room, locking the door behind   her. While the girl in white watches, two of the vampiresses unlock the   door and release Frederic.It is now midnight, and Frederic goes to the aquarium where he finds   that the photographer has been murdered. A man with a briefcase walks   past, and Frederic follows him into the Metro. When the man pulls a gun on   him, Frederic kicks the gun from his hand, pulls the cord to stop the   train, and runs away. The man follows, cornering Frederic on a balcony.   Meanwhile, the two vampires throw a switch that turns on myriad fountains,   which afford Frederic with cover, and he is able to escape.Frederic tells his mother about seeing the girl in white. She tries   to convince him that he is mad and, while Frederic is changing clothes,   she calls the hospital. When Frederic leaves the house, he is immediately   captured by two ambulance drivers and taken to the hospital where he is   placed in a straitjacket and told that he is going to receive electroshock   therapy. While pacing in his room, Frederic sees the girl in white. He   begs her to speak to him if she truly exists, and she mouths the words \"Je   t\u0027aime\". Then she disappears. Two nurses come to take Frederic to the   psychiatrist, but they turn out to be the two vampires. Instead, they   attack the psychiatrist, untie the straitjacket, and allow Frederick to   escape.While running down the street, Frederic sees a blind man selling   postcards of the ruins, so he buys one and learns that it is called   Sauveterre Castle. Certain that the girl in white is calling for his help,   Frederic catches the train to Sauveterre. It is just as he remembers it.   He even finds the toy that he left lying on the castle steps.

Jennifer was imprisoned in Sauveterre Castle when she   was 16 in order to prevent the vampire curse from spreading. It was   Jennifer who killed Frederic\u0027s father. The corpses of the four vampires   freed by Frederic were moved to the abandoned vault in Paris. While three   men track down and stake the four vampires and build a bonfire to burn   their bodies, Frederic\u0027s mother sends him back into the castle with orders   to kill Jennifer and bring her head. But Frederic cannot do it and,   instead, brings the head of a statue which he tosses into the bonfire.After everyone leaves, Frederic returns to the castle and awakens   Jennifer. She tells him how she learned to project her sight and then her   spirit while she lay in her coffin waiting for Frederic to come. He allows   her to turn him into a vampire, and they both get into her coffin and let   the tide carry them out to sea.

Once Eleanor is alone she starts to brush her hair, but when she stops her hair parts on it\u0027s own, and Eleanor is deeply frightened once more. The next morning Nell finds Dr. Marrow\u0027s studies, and learns what the experiment actually is. She also finds out that he\u0027s interpreting her behavior as delusional. In the statue garden Luke talks to Theo and seems to have also figured out what Dr. Marrow was doing, but when they encounter Nell, she expresses that it\u0027s not Dr. Marrow doing everything to the house, and that it\u0027s indeed ghosts. She then insists that home is where the heart is. When Nell looks up she sees Hugh Crain\u0027s wife hanging, but no one else sees it leading everyone to think even more that Eleanor is mentally unstable and should go home. Nell rushes to the library and finds pictures of Hugh Crain\u0027s wife whispering for her to check the fire place. In the fire place Nell finds a skeleton that comes to life causing Nell to run away, following the voices of children. She tries to go through a door but is punched by a hand that formed from the door and soon disappeared. Eleanor rushes to the rest of the group and concludes that Hugh Crain took children from the town to work at the mills then never let them go. As she tells this to Theo, Luke, and Dr. Marrow, they conclude that she\u0027s going crazy from emotional distress and fear.  As Theo tries talking to Dr. Marrow about her, she finds that they\u0027re in an experiment to study reactions to fear, and becomes furious at what the experiment had done to Nell. Once Nell\u0027s in bed and Theo finishes comforting her and leaves to bring her tea, the walls form the shape of a face, and everything starts falling apart around her. She runs out and looks in the mirror to see Mrs. Crain\u0027s face, and then runs away again to the carousel room. She\u0027s then extremely frightened and runs to the green room. Theo, Luke, and Dr. Marrow go searching for Nell and finally come to the green room to find Nell climbing the spiral stair case. Dr. Marrow goes to save her, but the stairway starts to unhinge, causing Dr. Marrow to desperately and quickly bring Nell to safety. Dr. Marrow goes to the green room to examine and take notes, and is grabbed by the statue of Hugh Crain, which them starts to fountain out blood. He runs to Theo and Luke, to go check on Eleanor. Eleanor\u0027s bed cages her in metal beams, and Theo, Luke, and Dr. Marrow desperately try to get in to help. Once they get in everyone else finally observes the paranormal aspects of Hill House for the first time. As soon as they get Nell out they try to leave, but Hill House makes sure that there\u0027s no way of escaping. Nell then runs back to the house knowing that she\u0027s meant to save the children. Everyone runs in looking for her, so they can leave, and they finally find her. Even after Theo tries to compromise with letting her by letting her live with her, Nell refuses to leave until she saves the children. Luke, Theo, and Dr. Marrow still try to escape now that they can\u0027t leave the house, but can\u0027t find anyway out. Luke then falls into the fire place, and as he\u0027s trying to get out he gets decapitated by a stone lion. The house is now coming to life, and everything that can is trying to attack the current occupants.  Finally the ghost of Hugh Crain comes out for a final battle, but as his ghost is being sent to the walls Eleanor goes along with it crashing her body against the stone door. She then falls to the ground dying. As Nell dies the children\u0027s spirits are release along with her\u0027s.

As his family\u0027s wealth begins to run out, the Baron is forced to allow a TV crew shooting a documentary on his monster-making ancestors to film at his castle in Germany. However, the Baron has ideas of his own: using the money from the film crew\u0027s rent, he buys an atomic reactor and uses it to create a hulking monster, transplanting his butler\u0027s brain into the thing and using it to kill off the film crew for more spare parts. —Jeremy Lunt \u003cdurlinlunt@acadia.net\u003e","startyear":"1958","runtimeminutes":"83","synopsis":"Title and credits roll over a mist covered lake with a tree in the foreground. We open with a woman, Carolyn Hayes (Jana Lund) running towards the camera. She is being chased by a man, Hans Himmler (Mike Lane). She stops, looks back, screams, and then continues running. We only see the man from the waist down as he plods along with a limp. The woman is cornered, now at the same location where the titles and credits were shot. The creature approaches as the woman walks backwards into the lake. The monster grabs the girl, then holds her under water. The director, Douglas Row (Don Red Barry) calls, \"Cut!\" The actor playing the monster does not speak English, so Shuter (Norbert Schiller) must translate. Morgan Haley (John Dennis), the cameraman, confirms that the scene was ok. Doug checks the length of the scene with Judy Stevens (Charlotte Austin). Doug and Judy are divorced and things are still a little frosty in their relationship. He tells her, \"Jealousy, jealousy, lover. Don\u0027t blame me because you\u0027re no longer an ingénue. Well, I keep you on the payroll, you\u0027ll have to admit I\u0027m loyal.\" She tartly replies, \"Oh yes, you\u0027re loyal to wives number one through four inclusive.\" Carolyn is helped from the water. She tells Mike Shaw (Tom Duggan) that this movie scene is to celebrate the 230th anniversary of Frankenstein.Inside the castle, Baron Victor von Frankenstein (Boris Karloff) berates his old friend Wilhelm Gottfried (Rudolph Anders), \"How could you inflict these people upon me Gottfried?\" Gottfried reminds the Baron that he agreed to let the film crew use his castle for the money he needed to purchase a reactor for his experiments. He adds, \"I\u0027ve been wanting to talk to you about this Victor. You have been spending money and money. You have been buying equipment as though you were a government.\" Gottfried has been handling the Baron\u0027s finances and has sold most of his art treasures. The discussion turns to the past. The Baron was tortured during the past and is bitter and scarred. He sports a long scar that runs from his left eye to the corner of his mouth. It is apparent that his nose was severely broken. He was forced to perform medical experiments. The Baron is the last of the House of Frankenstein. The film cast and crew return to the castle. Doug Row briefs the Baron on his upcoming performance. Doug is pushy and obnoxious. The Baron is having reservations about involvement in this exploitation of his family history, but he wants that atomic reactor badly and reluctantly cooperates with Row. He has contempt for all but one. He is strangely attracted to Carolyn Hayes and tells her so, \"That could be my pleasure with you as my leading lady, Miss Hayes.\" He takes her hand and kisses it. She recoils slightly, repelled by the Baron\u0027s clumsy advances. Turning back to the director, the Baron tells him, \"Mr. Row, I\u0027m becoming reconciled to your presence here. Your coming here may be the solution to all my problems.\" The Baron laughs maniacally then limps away. He seats himself at an organ and plays a melancholy tune.It is rehearsal day in the basement of the castle. The Baron reads an inscription on the tomb of an ancestor. \"I, Frankenstein, began my work in the year 1740 and with all good intentions and humane thoughts to the high purpose of probing the secrets of life itself - with but one end - the betterment of mankind.\" He explains his ancestor\u0027s work, as he limps around the basement, and what went wrong. The scene is disrupted when Carolyn screams as the Baron appears ready to stab the corpse on the slab. Hans tells Shuter he is finished and will no longer work at the castle. Row\u0027s cash payment convinces Hans to remain. The Baron was off script, as Judy reminds her ex-husband, but Doug loved it anyway.The cast and crew are relaxing in the great room of the castle. Mike is on the phone. Carolyn, Gottfried, and Judy are relaxing and having coffee. The Baron is playing the organ. Judy presents Shuter with a gift, a plaid scarf. She wraps it around his neck, then gives him a friendly kiss on the cheek. The Baron is not amused. He confronts his servant, \"Shuter. You are richly endowed to have one as lovely as Miss Hayes bestow gifts upon you.\" Row enters the room with script changes, then exits with Carolyn under the pretext of going over her new scene. Gottfried confronts the Baron with his concerns. It seems that the Baron has been working with the Director of the Morgue. \"Are you interested in corpses?\" He asks the Baron. The Baron makes his friend uneasy with his menacing demeanor. The Baron lights a candle, douses the lights in the Great Room, then descends the stairs to the basement crypt. He twists the head on a statue. A stone crypt lid slides open. The Baron climbs inside and descends the stairs to his secret lab below. A large modern lab is revealed. The walls are covered with electronic equipment and the centerpiece is a nuclear reactor. The Baron listens in on his guests with hidden microphones in their rooms. Studying an old picture of himself, he admires a clay bust - still a work in progress. He opens the reactor door and a gurney of a bandaged figure emerges. The head is just a skull. The Baron dons a lab apron, and washes his hands. Shuter is upstairs securing the castle. The Baron returns to his creature, another work in progress. He removes the bandages on the arm. He records his observations on a reel to reel tape machine. Shuter walks downstairs to the crypt area, securing it for the night. He activates the crypt door by accident. He investigates the open sarcophagus, walks down the hidden stairs, and encounters the Baron. The Baron is sorry to see his old friend and trusted servant has discovered his secret, \"Shuter. Ah, my poor Shuter. Why did it have to be you?\" He becons his servant to approach the body and promises that he will live again. He hypnotizes Shuter. The Baron harvests Shuter\u0027s heart for his creation.The next morning Carolyn is fixing breakfast. She notes that Shuter is absent. Judy calls for Shuter, but he is gone. The Baron explains that Shuter is away visiting relatives and may be away for some time. The Baron returns to his lab. He notes that Shuter\u0027s brain is now in the skull of his creature. He prepares to install the eyes. He retrieves a pair, in a glass jar, from the lab refrigerator. The closing door bumps his arm and he drops the container. The eyes are destroyed.Sometime later, Gottfried is reviewing some papers in the library as the Baron plays his organ. Carolyn enters and joins the Baron at the organ. He turns to ogle his guest, \"You seem rather disturbed my dear.\" She tells the Baron that organ music reminds her of death. The Baron notices Carolyn has Shuter\u0027s scarf. She tells him she found it down in the basement. The Baron takes the scarf from Carolyn, places it around his own neck, and then resumes playing his creepy tune. Gottfried enters and asks where Shuter has gone. He notes Shuter has no relatives and a quick search of his room revealed all his clothes are still there. The Baron threatens to tell Gottfried the tale of the inquisitive Commandant of the prison camp. The Baron delights in recounting the tale telling Gottfried that one day his tormentor was found without a tongue. He is gleeful, \"Imagine the irony of it Gottfried. Oh, I know, I was called in to examine the poor wretch. A beautiful piece of surgery, if I do say so myself. Beautiful.\" Gottfried seems to get the message and leaves the room.In the lab, the Baron moves his creature back into the reactor and closes the door. He starts the reactor, and steam wafts from the machine. The demand for power causes the lights in the castle to dim. An alarm bill signals the completion of the process. The body is brought out of the reactor. The Baron\u0027s intercom allows him to hear Doug\u0027s unsuccessful attempt to gain access to Carolyn\u0027s locked room. The Baron examines his creation. Judy types in her room, while Mike sleeps fitfully in his. The Baron\u0027s creation is now standing, still strapped to the gurney. He attempts to contact the mind of Shuter, now encased in his creation. Finally the EEG shows a reaction. He orders Shuter to raise each arm, the creature follows the instructions. The last order of business is to secure a pair of eyes. Mike visits Judy in her room. He has a bottle and glass. Mike kisses Judy, then pours and downs a glass of liquor. He tries another pass, but gets thrown out of Judy\u0027s room. She locks him out and tells him to go to bed. A subsequent knock at the door brings Judy back to scold Mike. When she opens the door the creature is there. She screams and faints. It carries her to the lab, but the Baron chastises his creation. He wanted Row\u0027s eyes. Her eyes were unsuitable and the Baron puts them in a disposal device.Doug and Mike argue over Judy\u0027s sudden disappearance. Doug is skeptical considering she left without an alimony check. The Baron claims to know nothing about it. Row suggests using the Baron\u0027s lab as a setting for the TV show. The Baron asks, \"Gottfried, is the laboratory included in the contract with Mr. Row?\" The answer is no, which prompts the Baron to reply, \"Then you cannot use it.\" When pressed, the Baron is adamant -- the answer is NO!Morgan and Carolyn go to the basement crypt to set up shots. Carolyn practices her moves, unaware the creature is behind her in shadow. Carolyn leaves and Morgan remains to line up a few more shots. He looks through his lens and pans around the room. The creature comes into frame and approaches the cinematographer. Back in the lab the Baron examines the eyeballs, but declares them unsuitable due to blood type mismatch. Another pair of eyes are disposed. Inspector Raab (Irwin Berke) takes a missing persons report from Doug Row. The Baron tells the policeman that Judy was married to Mr. Row, so she must have been emotionally disturbed and Morgan went to Frankfurt to get a special lens. Carolyn tells Raab she last saw Morgan in the basement. The Baron volunteers to escort Raab to see for himself. While all are down in the basement looking for Morgan, the Baron sees the sarcophagus lid swing open. He closes it. Finding nothing, Raab apologizes to the Baron for the intrusion.Gottfried comments to the Baron on all the disappearances. The not so subtle reminders to those who question him gone unheeded, the Baron finally agrees to satisfy Gottfried\u0027s curiosity. They descend into the crypt. The Baron opens the sarcophagus entrance to his lab. The creature stares at his next victim through opening in the bandages where eyes should be. The Baron kills his old friend and installs the eyes in his creation. He disposes of Gottfried\u0027s clothes in the disposal. Doug and Mike examine the crypt area for clues. Doug finds Morgan\u0027s view finder. He tells Mike he intends to report this to Inspector Raab. The Baron uses a coin from his collection to hypnotize Mike Shaw. He questions Mike about Row. He directs Mike to get Carolyn at a designated time. Row meets with Raab. He convinces Raab that Judy, Shuter, and Morgan never left the castle. At the designated time Mike fetches Carolyn from her room. Carolyn is confronted by the still bandaged creature. As Raab and Row drive back to the castle, the creature carries Carolyn down to the Baron\u0027s lab. She wakes and screams. Carolyn pleads with Shuter to bring her back upstairs. He is conflicted between his affection for Carolyn and the Baron\u0027s orders. The Baron fires up his machine. Shuter enters the lab without Carolyn and trashes the place. He walks towards the Baron and is overcome by the atomic steam.The charred remains of the Baron\u0027s creation is prone on the floor. A man in a radiation suit takes readings. He allows Raab to enter the lab. Two police officers, Row and Mike also walk in. Raab peels back the bandages on the face of the creature. A younger, unscarred Baron\u0027s face is shown. Row plays back the tape and hears, \"I made you in my image so the name of Frankenstein could survive. I gave you eyes, ears, a heart, a brain and.\" The voice fades out. We close with a close-up of the creature\u0027s head with the face of the Baron.","numvotes":"1158","primarytitle":"Frankenstein 1970"},"color":"rgb(119,86,100)","size":1.0},{"source":"object of desire","target":"tt0061036","id":"7199","attributes":{"productioncompany":"Arco Film","countriesoforigin":"Italy","averagerating":"6.3","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"La strega in amore","storyline":"A historian goes to a castle library to translate some ancient erotic literature.

Good food and peace and tranquility, she says. She tells him that her door is never locked and he tells her that the most important thing is for her to be like her mother was when she was young. They go into the greenhouse, where she tells him her mother grows a plant she brought with her from Mexico in a tea which she drinks. He kisses her and asks if she likes it. She agrees.There is a catfight and she asks him to chase them away. He picks up some clods and throws them at the cats. At least one cat is seen exiting the window.

They begin embracing until a noise is heard in the room.They look up and see Fabrizio (Gian Maria Volonté) placing some books on a shelf, having just awakened. Surprised to see her, Fabrizio approaches and welcomes her back. She suggests that Sergio has tried to attack her and that she resisted. Fabrizio turns to question Sergio, who denies an attack. Fabrizio looks him over for signs of resistance but finds none. Asking why he is there, Fabrizio hears that Sergio has answered an ad for a librarian. Sergio tells Fabrizio that he is still the incumbent librarian and that no one has fired him. He questions Aura as to why he is there. She claims that he has been rejected by her and her mother although initially was accepted. She tells Sergio to go, reassuring Fabrizio that he will remain. Sergio asks what the ending to the comedy is. He receives a slap on the face from Aura.  Good ending.  he says.Fabrizio questions Sergio about whether Consuelo rejected him or he chose not to take the job. Sergio tells him Consuelo changed her mind. When Fabrizio asks what if anything the old woman said about him, Sergio replies  nothing good.  Sergio turns to leave.Hearing a strange noise, Sergio finds Consuelo conducting a ritual with a crucifix. She stops when she sees him, telling him that the doctor friend just left. She convinced the doctor that there was a misunderstanding.Sergio calls out the window to his friend Marco (Vittorio Venturoli) who is leaving. As he tells the old woman he is leaving, she insists he say goodbye to Aura. He approaches Aura in the next room and sits by her. Consuelo tells him that they had hoped he would prove to be a good friend and that she lied to him earlier about the dead cat. It is Fabrizio who tortured the cat, she claims. She wants Sergio to do Auras eyebrows. He is handed the pencil and begins tracing her eyebrows. She tells him to go.Outside, Sergio is told by his friend that the old lady said he had left. He asks if the doctor thinks she is crazy and is told that most likely she takes drugs. Offering to take Sergio to lunch, the doctor drives off after being told that Sergio will remain.Sergio questions the owner of a nearby antique shop about the purchases bought from the old lady. She claims the money is in the millions and that Consuelo is at least twenty years older than she. Sergio disbelieves that, pointing out that she has a young daughter. He is told Consuelo has no daughter and that most of the money went towards facial reconstruction. Sergio returns to the house.He sees Fabrizio praying for strength in the chapel. Sitting down, he offers an amen to the prayer. Fabrizio questions why he has returned, then urges Sergio to serve as a confessor in the chapels confessional. Fabrizio confesses to living in hell and loving it. He tells of a false body near him each night to which he is addicted and wants absolution. When Sergio tells him he cannot absolve him, Fabrizio is upset and tells Sergio he should leave. Sergio also recommends that Fabrizio leave, which he says he cannot do. He asks that they make a pact that if he can convince Aura that Sergio will leave.Aura comes in and tells Fabrizio it is time for the bath. He points out that Sergio has come back and tells her to welcome him with a kiss. She approaches Sergio as if to kiss him but whispers  thank you. Aura prepares the bath and Fabrizio tells Sergio that he was destitute when he first came but that the old lady gave him everything he has now. He tells Aura to pour a drink for Sergio, which she does. She goes back into the bathroom and changes into a robe as Sergio watches through the door. He tells Fabrizio that it is time for him to leave them alone. Fabrizio says it is time for his bath and goes in. Sergio approaches Aura and they begin kissing on the bed. They talk about Fabrizio and she admits she is afraid of him. They begin more passionate kissing and Aura pushes him away, saying that Fabrizio is watching. He is shown looking through the glass at them. She says to Sergio that it is impossible tonight and goes into the bathroom. Sergio feels something under the pillow and finds a small gun. He examines it and places it back. Hearing them kissing, he opens the door and is told by Fabrizio that it is impossible tonight. Aura is seen sitting on the bed. Sergio leaves.Fabrizio and Aura are seen fencing (they are wearing no masks). He gives her some instructions. They look over and see Sergio watching them. Fabrizio gives her an epée and they resume. He strikes her epée down and teases her with the tip of the blade. Sergio rushes over to her aid, but is rebuffed by Fabrizio, who tells him to stop being a hero. She excuses herself and leaves. Sergio tells Fabrizio that he is tormenting her and keeping her as a slave. Fabrizio answers that she likes him, which is disputed by Sergio. Telling Fabrizio that he will take the job, Sergio is told that the job belongs to Fabrizio. Sergio says he will ask Consuelo.They enter Consuelos quarters and Fabrizio tells her that Aura is pleased with him. She asks Sergio what he wants and he begins to tell her that he wants the job, but is interrupted by Fabrizio, who insists that she tell Sergio he is not wanted or needed. She replies that the decision is hers to make. Asking if Sergio approves of the pay and agrees to live in the palace, she hires him and tells him to remove Fabrizio. He tells Fabrizio to pack his bags and leave. This infuriates Fabrizio, who turns to see Aura looking in. He goes after her. Consuelo tells Sergio to go after him.Seeing the elevator going up, Sergio takes the stairs and ends up in the library, calling for Aura. The lights go out and he looks around, finding a sabré which has been stabbed into the mummified corpse. Muffled screams are heard. As Sergio runs through the darkened library, he sees Fabrizio grab Aura and run out of the room. He chases after them. Hearing them nearby, he pushes away books from a shelf and sees them embracing. Aura reaches out to Sergio, who fights with Fabrizio. In the struggle Fabrizio is killed. When Sergio informs the women he will have to report this accidental death to the police, Consuelo tells him no and to dispose of the body. He insists he will tell but is told that they will testify that he came in and violently attacked them. Sergio realizes they are working together and that he has been used to kill someone they no longer wanted around. Stunned, he offers disbelief. Both women insist that he must do as he is told.Sergio is told to put the body in the trunk of Consuelos car because his is too small. Then he is given a roll of heavy tape and told to do as he was instructed so that the body will not be identifiable. Sergio takes the body to nearby railroad tracks and tapes the arms to the rails, positioning the head so the train will run over it. He hides in the bushes and checks his watch as he waits for the train. A man is seen crossing the tracks with a bicycle. The train roars through and Sergio returns to the palazzo.He tells Aura that everything went as planned and that he is leaving. He will tell no one about this. She professes that she wants him. He tries to leave but is irresistibly drawn to her. Consuelo tells him that now that he has proven his worth, she is able to reveal that Aura is not her daughter.The three are seen eating with Sergio watching. Aura and Consuelo have almost identical hand movements. They rise and look at Sergio. Consuelo says she is cold and for Aura to go and see if a window is open. As she leaves, strange music is heard. Consuelo comments on the music and Sergio calls for Aura. Consuelo pours another cup of the potion tea and drinks it as Sergio comes back into the room. He questions why she drinks it if it is harmful. She begins chanting, saying that it is life. She begins ritual dancing and speaking Italian. He asks where she has sent Aura. The dancing continues and Consuelo tells him to look in the dark. Aura is seen emerging from the shadows and begins a sensual dance. Both women are seen dancing as Sergio watches. Aura begins writhing on her knees until finally Sergio cries out for it to stop. The music stops but Consuelo is not seen. Aura approaches him and they go to Fabrizios bedroom.Sergio tells her he would prefer to go to her bedroom, but she insists that this is her bedroom and that they will be together forever here. Sergio turns and sees Consuelo watching. He angrily tells her to get her ugly face away and stop watching. Aura, undressed and sitting in bed, turns out the light. He tries to turn it back on, but she insists she prefers the dark. She lies down and begins moaning, clutching the bed frame.He wakes the next morning alone in bed. Consuelo tells him that Aura is not there, but that she told her last night how happy she was. She asks Sergio if he is happy and he agrees. She tells him that she is afraid that something will happen to interfere with that happiness. She brings his breakfast on a tray and clothes for him to wear. She tells him that the newspaper reports nothing bad. He is told to begin work in the library that day.Sergio goes outside as the city bells are ringing. Glancing down, he sees Consuelo dragging a cat by a rope around its neck. He goes into the fencing room and finds Aura, kissing her and telling her he missed waking up with her. He says he wants to take her away and leave Consuelo behind. She insists that this is her home and that he will not be able to persuade her otherwise. Saying she misses Fabrizio and his fencing, she tries to get Sergio to fence with her. He refuses and takes away her foil. She draws two epées and gives one to him. He kicks it away and takes hers away from her. They argue over the mention of Fabrizios name, which he never wants to hear again. He slaps her a few times, asking to know the truth. She says she will go away, leaving him alone with Consuelo. He locks the door and demands to know who she really is. She asks for him to let her out. He throws away the key. She runs from door to door but they are all locked. Exhausted, she sinks to the floor and begins twitching. He asks what is wrong. She contorts on the bed and Sergio calls for Consuelo. She tells him to leave her alone and retreats into the closet behind clothes. He calls to her and pulls aside the clothes. Consuelo is revealed. She tells him that she transforms herself into Aura for his pleasure and to give her time.Unbelieving, he runs around the house, calling for Aura. Unable to find her, he goes into the greenhouse and sits to wait. Outside a raging thunderstorm begins. He hears the womans voice calling him. He turns and sees Aura in the distance. She approaches him. Consuelo is also seen, warning him not to imprison Aura again. She must be free to come and go. She bids him come back to the house. Aura says he will be able to see and touch her because the witch wills it to be so.Later he is seen watching a woman hanging clothes on a clothesline and singing. He goes to his desk in the library but pulls his knees up into the chair. Next he is seen praying for strength just as Fabrizio did. Consuelo hears him and tells him he is pathetic. She asks why he doesnt leave and get another job. He answers that he is happy here. He asks if she remembers the last lines her husband wrote. She tells him to return the book to the library. He quotes lines from the journal which tells of his wife having reincarnated someone. Rushing into her room, he tells her the last words of her husband were that he was afraid of her and wanted to know what she had become. What happened to him, Sergio asks her? She tells him that he committed suicide. She asks him to zip her dress and to take some things to the antique store to sell. He begs her to bring back Aura whom he has not seen for several months. He pours a cup of the tea and tries to force her to drink it. She reminds him that only she can bring Aura back and that he should not make her angry.As he is carrying a statue to the antique dealer, Marta pulls up in a car and calls to him. Selling the statue, he is seen collecting the money and going back to the palazzo. Marta tries to question him, but he seems disinterested and wonders how she found him. She says she was just on her way to the antique dealer and saw him. He goes back into the house where Consuelo is leaving. Giving her the money, she remarks how his former friend seems to want him. She says she doesnt know when she will be back and leaves. Marta tries to prevent him from closing the door but is unable.Sulking in the library, he hears Auras laughter and goes to investigate. She is seen lying on a couch. She gets up and tells him it is because of the new man. Sergio looks and sees a new young man (Ivan Rossamov) who has answered a newspaper ad. She tells him to tell the young man to leave, but he insists that it is he who will leave. She tries to persuade him to stay, claiming it is he that she wants. He says that is what he was told when he came there to work. She wants him to tell the new man to go and that he should not believe what Consuelo tells him. When she tells him that she loves him, he tells her to wait.Tying up Consuelos hands, he drags her outside to the iron gate and binds her hands to it with wire. Meanwhile the new man calls for Aura, who disappears into the dark. Sergio brings small palettes and wooden cases to build a fire under the witch. He then pours wine over the wood and lights it. As the witch screams  No!  he sits a short distance away to watch. The young man, having come outside, sees this. In the flames, Consuelos face turns to Aura as Sergio watches her burn.","numvotes":"329","primarytitle":"The Witch"},"color":"rgb(65,97,106)","size":1.0},{"source":"Horror Only","target":"tt0049616","id":"7236","attributes":{"productioncompany":"Schenck-Koch Productions","countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"4.7","titletype":"movie","notes":"Orientalism","originaltitle":"Pharaoh\u0027s Curse","storyline":"Archaeologists in Egypt find one of their crew has been turned into a blood sucking mummy after they have unleashed a three thousand year curse by entering a Pharaoh\u0027s tomb. —Ray Baden","startyear":"1957","runtimeminutes":"66","synopsis":"The movie opens with the Bel-Air production logo followed by the title and credits shown over a stone tablet of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs and then dissolves into a map of Egypt with the British Flag flying. We are in Cairo in the year 1902 at a British military outpost. A man explains to Colonel Cross (Ralph Clanton) that his soldiers were attacked by the local people. A riot is underway outside and a rock crashes through the window and lands on the Colonel\u0027s desk. Captain Storm (Mark Dana) reports to the Colonel for a new assignment. He is to go south to the Valley of the Kings with a very small contingent to rescue an archeological expedition. To add to his challenge he is to take the wife of the expedition\u0027s leader along. It seems that this dig went out without Egyptian approval and the authorities are concerned the locals may attack and kill the members of the dig. The planned route is the long way because it is safer.The rescue party on horseback crosses the desert. Leading the group is Capt. Storm, followed by Sylvia Quentin (Diane Brewster). The third in line is Sgt. Gromley (Richard Peel), followed by a man with a beard, Sgt. Smolett (Terence de Marney). They stop at an oasis for water and to rest. Storm turns on the charm and explains how things are done to Mrs. Quentin. Sylvia assures Storm she is accustomed to hardship. The group beds down for the evening in a brushy area of the desert. This gives Sylvia and Storm a chance to get better acquainted. Sylvia is perceptive and tells Storm he must have had one woman immune to his charms. The horses get spooked and Storm investigates. Gromley and Smolett join the captain, armed and ready for the intruder. Storm sees a woman, alone, approach their fire. Simira (Ziva Rodann as Ziva Shapir) explains that she is alone, and she is not lost. She was drawn by the light of their fire. She declines the food and water offered, and explains she is traveling to find her brother, Numar, who is helping the expedition with the tomb of Rahateb. Simira knows her brother is with them, and warns, \"You must hurry before it is too late.\" She offers to lead them on a more direct route, but Storm is reluctant to trust this stranger. They allow her to join them, but on the longer, safer route. The rescue party goes to bed and Simira reclines in the nearest tree.The next morning Gromley rouses Smolet, who is supposed to be on guard. He notices one of the mules, Mabel, is missing. She was carrying the food. They search but there are no hoof prints. They continue south. Simira walks behind the horses. Storm calls a halt and tries to convince Simira to ride one of the pack animals, but she again declines the offer. She tells Storm, \"I do not tire, Captain. The desert is my strength. You had better keep the animals for yourselves.\" Gromley checks the water container and finds it empty. He blames his colleague, Smolet, but also grows more suspicious of the stranger in their camp. Simira rubs a cat charm on a necklace around her neck.That evening, as the party gets sleep, a scorpion steals into camp. It stings Sylvia on the arm. When Storm calls for the medical kit, Gromley discovers the kit is missing, along with Simira. Storm uses a knife to cut Sylvias arm and he sucks out the poison. He uses the makeshift tourniquet to bandage the wound.The next morning Simira wanders back into camp. She claims she went the short way and reached the pass. Storm tells her Sylvia was stung by a scorpion. Simira insists they take the short route if Sylvia is to survive. Storm agrees to the change in routing, but promises Simira if it is a trap he will kill her first.At the tomb, Walter Andrews (Ben Wright) reads the cartouche, \"Let ye who seeks to disturb the eternal peace and sleep of the high priest beware. Flesh of my flesh shall creep into thy body and eat of the flesh of thy spirit until such time as he shall return into the pit of everlasting darkness, which he lived before life.\" The expedition leader, Robert Quentin (George Neise) orders the seal on the sarcophagus be broken. Andrews warns against desecrating the tomb. Quentin asks the opinion of Hans Brecht (Kurt Katch). Brecht replies, \"It is what we came for.\" Next he asks Claude Beauchamp (Robert Fortin). The little French alcoholic indifferently answers, \"What does it matter what I think, Robert. You will do what you want anyway.\" Beauchamp continues his sketches of the tomb. Quentin turns last to Dr. Michael Farraday (Guy Prescott). Farraday replies hes a man of science and he doesn\u0027t know much about superstition. Quentin stares at Numar (Alvaro Guillot) as if to ask his opinion, thinks better of asking a native, and then cuts open the seal on the lid.The rescue party now follows Simira across the desert. They arrive at a high point above the tent covered encampment below. Simira grimaces and clutches the charm on her necklace. She announces, \"We are too late. Theres no chance to help now. It is too late.\"In the tomb, Quentin and Brecht remove the lid over Andrew\u0027s objection. Inside is the mummified remains of the high priest. Farraday cuts into the wrappings on the head with a scalpel. As he does, Numar drops the torch he is holding and clutches the side of his face. He falls to the floor unconscious. Storm walks into the chamber carrying a torch.Storm confronts Quentin in his tent. He informs the leader, \"Tomorrow we seal up the tomb, and that\u0027s final.\" He adds that as soon as Sylvia is ready to travel they ride back to Cairo. Farraday stops in to talk to Quentin. He tells Quentin his wife is fine, but exhausted. He also reports that Numar is also fine, just a little shock. He adds that his sister, Simira is with him in his tent. Quentin visits with his wife in her tent. She is reluctant to give her husband the bad news. Quentin tries to convince her to be sick a little longer to delay their departure. She wanted to end their relationship in person. Her husband tries to explain what he did for her, then finally concludes Storm may have influenced her. Quentin next visits Beauchamp in the work tent. He is drinking and working on the diary and sketches. Brecht and Andrews are still working on the translation on the stone tablet. Quentin wants to find the king\u0027s tomb. Storm goes to Quentin\u0027s tent to talk, but the expedition leader is not there. He grabs a torch and walks into the tomb complex to find Quentin. There is a minor rock fall, but Storm continues his search. He hears someone using a pick on the wall and follows the sound. He finds Quentin and reminds him he ordered everyone out of the tomb. Quentin shows Storm that the mummy is missing and cat prints on the floor lead to a solid wall. Quentin storms off to confront Numar. He threatens the young man, but the doctor explains that Numar is now ill, very ill. His skin and teeth show rapid aging. Numar has a long scar down his face and his hair has turned gray. Quentin is obsessed with the tomb and shows no regard for Numar or his wife.Gromley shoots at Numar entering the tomb. One of the animals is discovered drained of all its blood. Storm tries to get answers from Simira, but only gets the same words of warning unheeded. He confines her to her tent. Storm, Quentin, Beauchamp, Farrady, and Gromley enter the tomb carrying torches. They split up to search the tomb passages for Numar. Quentin and Beauchamp find what might be the tomb of the king. Beauchamp sarcastically observes that Quentin needed more time and got it. Gromley enters a chamber and looks around, but his torch is extinguished by a gust of wind. A door opens and Numar, now very old, approaches the Sergeant. Gromley fires several shots from his revolver directly into Numar, but it has no effect and he continues to approach. He attacks. Later we learn that Gromley\u0027s blood was rapidly and completely drained. The noise draws the others to the chamber where they discover the body.Andrews and Brecht complete the translation on the stone tablet. They relay the contents. It is a letter from Rahateb to his high priest regarding his funeral arrangements. The high priest is to commit suicide and guard the king after the king\u0027s death. Andrews notes that when the high priest\u0027s mummy was disturbed the trouble started. Storm now decided they must remain to solve the mystery and the death of one of his soldiers. The entire party reenters the tomb to work. Brecht goes off alone to explore the tunnels in the tomb complex. Quentin is working on the wall with a pick. Storm finds an opening above their chamber and explores the room. Brecht explores a chamber room. A door swings open and he crawls under it and into another room. It is well stocked with statues and other treasures. A door opens and an even more decrepit Numar exits approaching Brecht. He attacks Brecht, but the man, barely alive, escapes the room with scratches on his face. Storm enters the hidden room and fires at the retreating Numar. He grabs Numar\u0027s arm as the door closes. The arm is torn off in the process.Farraday examines the arm and exclaims, \"Unbelievable. His body disintegrating. Turning into dust.\" Storm makes an appeal to Simira to help them find her brother, but she again repeats her chant of, \"Tried to warn, tried to help, you would not listen.\" She is escorted back to her tent. Sylvia appeals to Storm to give up so they can leave. In her tent she sees the shadow of a cat, but at the entrance Simira enters. Simira stares at Sylvia, who runs from her tent. Simira pulls off her necklace. Sylvia makes her way into the tomb complex. She feels her way around trying to find her colleagues. An arm grabs Sylvia and she screams, but it is only Smolet. He heads Sylvia to her husband. They walk into the secret room. She relays her story about Simira to the group. They return outside looking for Simiar. Andrews and Quentin remain behind. Quentin pulls a gun on Andrews and tries to beat the location of the king\u0027s chamber out of him. The door flies open and Numar is there looking worse than ever. He turns and walks deeper into the tomb of Rahateb and Quentin follows. Quentin only gets a few feet inside when the ceiling collapses killing and burying him.Outside, Storm searches each tent for Simira with no luck. It is then they notice Quentin and Andrews missing. They enter the tomb complex and see the remains of the expedition leader. Beauchamp sees Simira\u0027s shadow on the wall and finds her amulet. As the group exits the tomb complex they find the sarcophagus lid back in place. They open it and cut the wrapping on the mummy. There they find Numar as an ancient, decayed mummy. Numar is now the high priest, destined to guard his king. Simira is the cat goddess. They replace the lid and exit the tomb. They bury their dead and depart on their horses. Beauchamp destroys his notes and sketches because he feels no one would believe his story. He drops the cat amulet and we close with the remaining members of the expedition and rescue party riding off on their horses.","numvotes":"619","primarytitle":"Pharaoh\u0027s Curse"},"color":"rgb(93,99,84)","size":1.0},{"source":"Horror Only","target":"tt0004026","id":"7032","attributes":{"productioncompany":"Deutsche Bioscop GmbH","countriesoforigin":"Germany","averagerating":"6.8","titletype":"movie","notes":"Golem themes, folk horror","originaltitle":"Der Golem","storyline":"In this version of the golem legend, the golem, a clay statue brought to life by Rabbi Loew in 16th century Prague to save the Jews from the ongoing brutal persecution by the city\u0027s rulers, is found in the rubble of an old synagogue in the 20th century.

Six unruly prep school students are forced to serve Saturday detention for eight hours at Crestview Academy, where psychologist Dr. Day (Jeffrey Schmidt) conducts psychological testing on the students to examine their personalities and trigger their demeanors, recording each session in the process. Despite receiving an expulsion notice from Headmaster Nash (Judd Nelson), a new low-income student Matt Clark (Cameron Deane Stewart) plans to compensate for his poor behavior by joining the awkward Tarek Ahmed (Marc Donato), the jock Craig Cook (Roger Edwards), the sly Goth girl Veronica Harmon (Augie Duke), the prissy and asthmatic Megan McDurst (Amanda Alch), and the popular girl Tricia Wilkes (Ali Faulkner) in detention.   After giving them the task to complete a school history assignment, Dr. Day restricts their internet reach and takes away many of their phones, leaving the students imprisoned alone in the library, remodeled by the janitor, Max (Ben Browder), with Native American portraits and an Apache statue. The students believe the library is haunted. They realize they have mutually dysfunctional family lives, though they have their differences with each other, sparked from prior encounters which have been recorded on camera. They all try to break out of the library, but they are sealed in. Behaving mischievous, Veronica hides Megans inhaler and frames Tarek, leading to Megan having a shortness of breath and dying before its found.   Getting the internet to work, Veronica does her research. They discover an old, deceased Indian, Jacob Rainwater, once owned land that was stolen from the Apache tribe in the 1870s by a General, Andrew Winston Clarke, before it was taken over by the city of Crestview to build the school. As the students argue on-and-off, they find a vent to navigate to different rooms that have its doors locked on both sides. Thereby, they learn Matt has an undisclosed criminal background and become suspicious of him. After Tarek goes missing and they return to the library through the vent, they discover Tricias powerful mother is the Governor, Craigs father is the city councilman, and Megan\u0027s father co-owns the property of which Tareks father is responsible for building the library, all of who made an agreement with the school to ensure their spoiled kids would be guaranteed to graduate in exchange for the construction of the library.   A dark storm rages on outside the school, tampering with the lights and electronics inside, increasing the students fear of the paranormal. In an accident, Craig falls down the steps in the library and is mysteriously staked by one of his crutches, dying instantly. Not long after, Tricia admits her mother was the reason why Jacob lost his house, and Veronica secures evidence on Craigs camera showing that Tricia, Craig, Megan and Tarek had killed Jacob at his home to vacate the ownership of the property, leaving no next of kin to take over. Deeply believing in ghosts, they attempt to contact Jacobs spirit so that Tricia can call a truce, but the spirit rebels and seemingly harms Veronica. The spirit then appears, and she uses a nail gun to commit suicide due to fright.   Shortly after, Dr. Day emerges to reveal his alliance with Veronica. The whole time, they masterminded everyone\u0027s paranormal delusions and emotional outbursts, triggered by psychological tests (inkblots), all to sell the story and make money. Killed by Dr. Day for trying to escape through the vent, Tarek\u0027s dead body is what was used as the ghost. Before Veronica can shoot Matt using the nail gun, Dr. Day abruptly kills her with an axe for poisoning him and causing his diarrhea earlier. Matt is framed for all the murders, as an unexpected booby trap involving the statue severs Dr. Day\u0027s head, killing him. A SWAT team barges in to find Matt armed with an axe in the middle of the carnage. Matt is subdued and placed in a straitjacket. Max arrives, revealing his Apache ancestor, Jacob Rainwater, owned the house where the school now stands, which at one time was also taken by General Clark and his army over a century ago.

He\u0027s fascinated by what he finds and that it dates hundred of years before Christianity was introduced to the area. Accompanied by a young priest, Father Francis, to keep an eye on the religious elements of what they find, Merrin makes his way to the camp.

Many years before the events in The Exorcist, the young Father Merrin (played by Skarsgård, who played the same part in Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist) travels to East Africa. Merrin has taken a sabbatical from the Church and devoted himself to history and archaeology as he struggles with his shattered faith. He is haunted especially by an incident in a small village in occupied Holland during World War II, where he served as parish priest: near the end of the war, a sadistic Nazi SS commander, in retaliation for the murder of a German trooper, forces Merrin to participate in arbitrary executions in order to save a full village from slaughter.After World War II, Merrin is an archaeologist in Cairo, when he is approached by a collector of antiquities who asks him to come to a British excavation in the Turkana region of Kenya. This dig is excavating a Christian Byzantine church built circa 500 A.D. long before Christianity had reached that region of Africa. The collector asks Merrin to recover an ancient relic of a demon before the British can find it. Merrin agrees and travels to the dig site. He is joined by Father Francis, a Vatican scholar who was on his way to do missionary work in East Africa but was diverted by the Vatican to ensure the church is not desecrated. Upon arriving at the site, Merrin meets Major Granville, the British military officer in charge of the dig. Merrin also meets the chief excavator, a brutish man with visible boils on his face. And he meets Sarah, a doctor who spent time in a concentration camp during World War II and is haunted by what happened to her there. Merrin\u0027s translator and guide is Chuma. In addition, Merrin learns that the diggers are disappearing or leaving in droves because the local tribemen fear the church is cursed. Merrin witnesses a digger inexplicably experience a seizure.Merrin visits the dig site. Only the dome is uncovered; the rest of the church is buried beneath the earth. Merrin discovers that the church is in perfect condition, as though it had been buried immediately after its construction were completed. Merrin, Francis, and Chuma enter the church through the dome. They find it is near-pristine condition, but there are two oddities. First, all of the statues of the angels holding weapons are pointing the spears downward, whereas it is conventional for statues of angels to either have no weapons or to point them triumphantly toward heaven. Merrin and Francis deduce the sculptors were trying to depict the angels restraining something that was beneath the church. The second disturbing discovery is that someone has vandalized the church by ripping the enormous crucifix from its place on the altar and suspending it with Christ on the cross in an upside-down position, which is considered a desecration.Merrin is determined to learn more about the archeological dig and asks to consult with the lead archeologist, Monsieur Bession. Sarah tells Merrin that Bession went insane three weeks earlier and was transferred to a mental hospital in Nairobi. Merrin visits Bession\u0027s tent at the dig site and sees dozens of drawings of the same thing, the demon artifact the collector had asked Merrin to find. Merrin then travels to Nairobi to visit Bession. But when he enters Bession\u0027s room, he discovers Bession has carved a swastika on his chest and is speaking through demonic possession in the voice of the sadistic SS commander who tormented Merrin during the war. As Merrin registers these events, Bession slashes his own throat after saying he was \"free.\" Father Gionetti, warden of the asylum, speculates that Bession was not possessed but rather \"touched\" by a demon, which drove him mad and eventually to suicide. Merrin is very skeptical, but before he returns to the dig site, Father Gionetti gives him the volume of Roman rituals to use in exorcism, although Merrin claims he will never use them.Upon returning to the village, strange events continue. A local boy is attacked and killed by hyenas that seem to continuously stalk the dig, night and day. His younger brother, Joseph, enters a fugue state after watching his brother ripped to pieces. Merrin begins to suspect that something evil lies in the church and is infecting the region. There are stories of an epidemic that wiped out an entire village. However, when Merrin, growing suspicious of these rumors, digs up one of the graves of the supposed victims of this plague, he discovers it is empty. Meanwhile, the evil grows, turning people against each other and resulting in violence, atrocities, and more bloodshed.Father Francis reveals to Merrin that the builders of the church never meant it to be recorded in Vatican documents, however, a vague reference to it was recorded, leading to its subsequent discoveries in the 19th and 20th centuries. Francis also reveals that the church stands on the supposed site where Satan fell to earth after the war in heaven, and it was constructed by early Christians in an attempt to purify the evil that resides there.Beneath the church lies the ruins of an even older temple but not a Christian one. Rather, in the ruins under the church, Merrin and his allies find demonic icons, and other signs of evil and Satanism. This land is where he first encounters the demon that calls itself Pazuzu, which he will encounter again in The Exorcist. This is the demon that \"brushed\" Bession (driving him insane) and Joseph (making him ill).At the end of the movie, the dig\u0027s doctor, Sarah, turns out to be the possessed individual and has the demon exorcised from her in the tunnels below the church but dies. Dr. Merrin and Joseph emerge from the church, (once again buried in sand) and history has repeated itself. 50 (and 1500) years ago, everyone at the site was killed by an evil presence from the church, except for one priest. Now, only Father Merrin and the little boy are left as the British soldiers and the local tribes have annihilated each other.

The Director\u0027s cut runs 14 minutes longer and this synopsis caters for both versions.A thunderstorm filled, rainy night in the small town of Fairwater. A woman called Patricia Bradley (Dee Wallace) is been chased by a mysterious entity around the old-looking house in which she lives with her mother (Julianna Mcarthy). Patricia is screaming and fearing for her life. Her mother appears from her bedroom with a pump action shotgun and shoots the mysterious figure as its shape appears through the carpet at the top of the stairs.Some of the residents of Fairwater are gathering for a funeral in the community as the local newspaper editor Magda Rees Jones (Elizabeth Hawthorne) and her assistant are reporting the story of another seemingly innocent death amongst the residents. Psychic investigator Frank Bannister (Michael Andrew Fox) arrives at the funeral trying desperately to advertise his services. As he leaves in his wrecked and dirty looking Volkswagen, his reckless driving causes him to nearly hit an on-coming truck. As he swerves to miss it, he crashes straight through a garden fence. Ray Lynskey (Peter Dobson) comes out of his house infuriated and threatens to sue him for the damages. Frank gives him his business card and drives off after deliberately driving over one of Ray\u0027s garden gnomes.On the other side of town Ray\u0027s wife Doctor Lucy Lynskey (Trini Alvarado), visits the Bradley house to treat Patricia\u0027s cuts. She bandages her hand and tells her that she needs to take her to hospital but her mother (Julianna McCarthy) refuses to let her go. She tells her that she never leaves the house and to just give her some antibiotics. Lucy notices how timid and fragile Patricia is and as she gets ready to leave, she notices some bruising around her neck. Patricia\u0027s mother rushes Lucy out of the house and tells her that her daughter is not to be trusted. She was involved in cold-blooded murder.Becoming intrigued by Patricia\u0027s history, Lucy watches a documentary about the notorious serial killer Johnny Bartlett (Jake Busey).\"In the space of 27 blood-soaked minutes, 12 innocent people gunned down by hospital orderly John Charles Bartlett. Patients, medical staff, visitors, no one was spared in this madman\u0027s rampage through Fairwater Sanatorium.Not even the hospital chapel provided sanctuary,as those in prayer were gunned down on their knees. A seemingly senseless crime, Bartlett\u0027s motive remains a mystery to this day. Six years earlier Charles Starkweather had murdered 11 people in a Nebraska killing spree\".The black and white footage shows the horrific scenes at the hospital of the victims and the families, as well as the footage of Bartlett being escorted to court by the police boasting about his disgusting act.\"Fifteen year-old Patricia Ann Bradley, daughter of the hospital administrator, was also implicated in the killings. She was madly in love with the psychopath Bartlett. 2,200 volts of electricity ended the life of Johnny Bartlett, the unrepented killer. As they threw the switch he was heard to scream: I got me a score of twelve. Beat that!\" In what some consider a miscarriage of justice, Patricia Ann Bradley was sentenced to life imprisonment although it was never proven that she actively participated in the killings. Five years ago, Patricia Bradley was granted a conditional release by the State Governor. Today she lives a reclusive life back in the family home\"....Ray gets sick of listening to it and switches off the TV. He joins Lucy on the bed.(Director\u0027s cut) He tells her that he\u0027s booked their most favorite table at the Excalibur themed restaurant for their wedding anniversary.He starts to kiss her ,but he sees Frank\u0027s card that he\u0027s positive he tore up and the bed starts rocking and shaking with Lucy on it. It hovers up in the air as the couple panic. Objects start flying everywhere in the kitchen.Lucy calls Frank and he arrives to rid the house of the supernatural. Instead of charging the couple,he offers to do it in return for not having to pay for the damaged fence.Ray reluctantly agrees and Frank uses his \"equipment\" to capture the spooks and pours them down the sink. As he is packing his stuff up,he is shocked to see a glowing number 37 on Ray\u0027s forehead. Lucy cannot see this and Ray kicks Frank out of the house.Frank arrives at his home to his half-built house that he hasn\u0027t finished working on. As he gets out of is car,a spirit exits the trunk - a young, 1950\u0027s nerd called Stuart (Jim Fyfe), followed by a 1970\u0027s, afro-haired ghost called Cyrus (Chi Mcbride). The ghosts are Frank\u0027s associates who help him con the local residents by haunting their homes, so that Frank can step in and reap the rewards. While Stuart is just about to join them in the house, Frank closes the door and he gets stuck because his ectoplasm has become too stiff. Frank asks them if they had anything to do with the glowing number appearing on Ray\u0027s head but the spirits don\u0027t know what he\u0027s talking about.(Director\u0027s cut) Cyrus helps pull Stuart through the door.

As they are talking, gunshots go off, as another spirit, a judge from the 1800\u0027s (John Astin) enters the room trying to shoot the ghost dog Rhustler as he gnaws on his jawbone. Frank gets his jaw back and tells him to put his guns away.(Director\u0027s cut) Frank cuts some wood off from the roof of his house for his fireplace.He sits looking through the newspaper, trying to find people that have recently lost family, while The Judge contemplates going off into the graveyard to rest his decrepit body.

The figure moves in close to him but it is only Cyrus and Stuart underneath a cape. They tell him they are trying to figure out different ways to scare people but Frank isn\u0027t amused and walks off angry. The next morning Frank receives a letter from his bank informing him that he owes $16,000 dollars. He needs some money fast and he calls the spirits for a meeting demanding that they up their antics to really frighten people.Cyrus and Stuart arrive at a rich woman\u0027s house and start causing fear by picking up the resident\u0027s babies and scaring the mother and her maid as they see the babies hovering through the air. Again they leave one of Frank\u0027s business cards. Frank gets the phone call and sets off.(Director\u0027s cut) Frank is trying to drive to the house as fast as he can but he keeps getting stuck in traffic because the roads are blocked with funeral cars. The Judge is sat in the passenger\u0027s seat and tells him that there is something very sinister dawning over Fairwater. But Frank isn\u0027t interested in what he\u0027s saying.He impatiently and recklessly pulls out into the line of funeral cars and dodges around the traffic. He pulls up outside the house and tells Judge to wait for him.Frank walks into the house and attempts to pull off his scheme but the woman is not interested. She has in her hand the local newspaper which shows a picture of Frank with the headline \"Local conman haunts cemetery\". Frank is angry. He confronts Magda Rees Jones at the local Gazette about printing the story but she tells him he is a parasite who makes money off of the bereaved and she has every right to let people know about him. He leaves and he sees that another funeral is taking place.He sees Lucy in one of the cars crying. As he walks off down the street he is shocked to see Ray running towards him. But not in human form. Ray is now dead. His spirit runs straight into him. Ray is panicking and can\u0027t understand how he\u0027s died so young and fit. He tells Frank that just before he died he felt his heart been crushed while he was working out. Frank tries to explain the rules of the afterlife to him. Ray asks Frank to give him a ride to his funeral.(Director\u0027s cut) As Frank pulls up to the graveyard in his car, Ray (not yet used to being a spirit) has trouble grabbing hold of the door handle to get out. Frank pushes him through the car door and he lands on the ground.They walk through the graveyard and Ray is petrified as he witnesses many spirits roaming the grounds. Drill Sergeant Hiles (R.Lee Ermey), the watchful spirit of the other ghosts, walks out of his tomb and orders the ghosts to get back in their graves. Frank knows there will be trouble. He tells Ray to go on ahead while he talks to the angry sergeant. The two have a fight but with Hiles\u0027s supernatural abilities, Frank has no chance.While Hiles shouts to tell the inhbitants of the graveyard who\u0027s in charge, Frank goes off to join Ray at his funeral. As Ray becomes very emotional at his tragic death, he falls into the grave as he tries to put his arms around Lucy. He is horrified as he lays on top of his own corpse. As the mourners start to leave the graveside,sheriff Walt Perry (Troy Evans) arrives to talk to Frank. Apart from Lucy, he was the last person to see Ray alive and he wants to know what condition he seemed to be in when he saw him. He says that the FBI are becoming very concerned about the amount of deaths that are happening in the town - many of the victims are healthy and have clean arteries when the autopsy has taken place but their hearts look as though they have been squeezed. Frank tries to get rid of Walt by pretending that he wants to pay his respects to Ray, in order to pull Ray\u0027s spirit out of his grave. Walt is alarmed to see Frank physically grappling with thin air and seemingly talking to nothing. As Frank and Ray get ready to leave, an emotional Lucy approaches and tells Frank that she believes in his paranormal gifts. He tells her that he has in fact communicated with Ray.Frank has dinner with Lucy and the deceased Ray at the Excalibur themed restaurant and acts as a communicator between the two of them. But Ray becomes increasingly frustrated as his wife seems to start bonding with Frank throughout the evening. She asks him why he can see spirits and Frank tells her that he was in a car accident five years earlier and sometimes a traumatic experience can alter a person\u0027s perception. Lucy opens up too. She tells Frank that her and Ray\u0027s marriage was not a happy one and just as Frank tries to console her by grabbing her hand, Ray angrily knocks over a glass of wine into Frank\u0027s lap. Thrilled that he can now use make physical contact with the real world, Ray threatens Frank and disappears. Frank goes to the bathroom to dry his trousers. A man enters and Frank is shocked to once again see a glowing number on the man\u0027s head reading 38. Frank becomes increasingly edgy as he sees The Grim Reaper figure appear and kill the man by reaching into his chest and squeezing his heart. The man\u0027s corpse drops to the floor and Frank watches as the gateway to Heaven opens up and the man\u0027s spirit goes off to the other side. Frank rushes out of the restaurant and pursues The Reaper.Lucy is escorted to the Sheriff\u0027s office by one of Sheriff Perry\u0027s deputies as a witness to the situation. Walt is told that witnesses saw Frank rushing out of the restaurant before the dead man was found. He tells his men to bring Frank in.Frank chases the Reaper in his car with Stuart, Cyrus and The Judge. He tries his best to kill it but his car just goes straight through the caped figure and it once again eludes him.FBI agent Milton Dammers (Jeffrey Combs) arrives at the Sheriff\u0027s office to meet Walt and Lucy. He believes that Frank is behind the killings. He tells them about the incident that happened five years earlier when Frank and his wife had the car crash. They discovered that Debra\u0027s dead body was found 15 yards from the car with a number 13 carved in her forehead and after the body was found, Frank was picked up wandering the forest claiming to have no recollection of the incident.Frank tracks down The Reaper at the museum where the 39th life has been taken. Frank sees on Magda Reese-Jones\u0027s forehead a number 40 glowing. She is going to be the next target. He tries to warn her but two deputy sheriffs arrive to arrest him. The Reaper appears but the officers have their guns pointed at Frank. The Judge appears and shoots The Reaper and it disappears. Cyrus and Stuart start to make people scared in the museum in order to cause a diversion for Frank to get away. In the commotion, Frank punches Magda and knocks her out, in order to carry her out to his car to safety. He drives away but The Reaper is in pursuit and forces Frank to crash his car in the vicinity where Debra died years earlier. Magda crawls from the car trying to escape from Frank who she believes to be psychotic. Frank tries to get her to listen to him but he is dazed and confused as the Reaper plunges towards her and crushes her heart. Frank jumps towards it but it disappears again and he is lying face down on her corpse. The gateway to Heaven opens and Magda\u0027s spirit jumps from her body and accuses of Frank of being a sick murderer who is responsible for her and his wife\u0027s death.Frank arrives at the sheriff\u0027s office and tells them what has happened. When Walt asks him if he had anything to do with Magda\u0027s death, he doesn\u0027t answer and he is arrested on suspicion of murder. Lucy doesn\u0027t believe it and storms out as Frank is taken through to the interrogation room followed by Dammers.(Director\u0027s cut) Lucy goes out to her car and sits inside trying to get her head around things. Ray appears on the back seat - his spirit now decaying from dripping ectoplasm.Dammers and Walt are sat in the interrogation room with Frank who looks demoralized. Dammers calls him a dangerous man but Walt refuses to believe that Frank is behind the murders. Dammers uses his power of authority to tell Walt to get out of the room while he questions Frank. Frank tells Dammers that he is not a murderer and that he can communicate with the other side. He has seen the figure of Death killing people by reaching into their chests but Dammers doesn\u0027t believe any of it and believes Frank to be responsible for the crimes.(Director\u0027s cut) Cyrus and Stuart walk into the sheriff\u0027s and start to walk through the walls of the cells to find Frank. They eventually get to his cell and try to talk to him but Frank is silent. Cyrus tells Stuart that he can\u0027t even see them anymore. He\u0027s so traumatised he\u0027s stopped believing. Dammers looks through the narrow opening of the prison door observing Frank. He tells the deputy that he doesn\u0027t even expect him to make it until the trial. He\u0027s expecting him to commit suicide.Lucy goes to Frank\u0027s house to see if she can find any evidence to clear his name. As she wanders around, Ray is looking too.(Director\u0027s cut) Ray sees on the fridge some labels describing the layout of his and Lucy\u0027s house. He realises that Frank was using his psychic abilities to con them. One of the sticky labels gets stuck to his fingers.He tries to shake it off and as he does, Lucy sees it floating towards the back garden in the wind.She walks outside and sees a nice looking garden, which Frank has made in memory of his wife in place of the basketball court. The phone rings and the answering machine picks up the message. It\u0027s Old Mrs.Bradley trying to tell Frank about her fears for her daughter Patricia. Lucy believes the mother to be dangerous and after hearing her message, heads over to their house.She hides in the bushes outside as the old lady walks out to get rid of the garbage bags. She sneaks inside, looking for Patricia. Ray walks to the house and because of his abilities the house transforms into a weird shape from his point of view. He can sense there is danger lurking inside. Patricia is at the top of the stairs and tells Lucy they need to hide. As her mother walks back in, the two of them rush into her bedroom. Lucy tells Patricia that she needs to get away and start a new life for herself. She sees an urn on the side. They are Patricia\u0027s father\u0027s ashes. He had killed himself after discovering that Patricia had been involved with a serial killer. She hears her mum coming up the stairs and tells Lucy to hide in the wardrobe. She just gets inside as her mother enters. Patricia offers to make her a cup of tea and they walk out. Lucy finds a Stanley knife in the wardrobe with the initials F.B. She realises that it\u0027s Frank\u0027s that Dammers had told her had gone missing after Debra\u0027s death. Lucy slowly walks down the stairs to sneak out. The Urn starts to glow and a figure appears in the wall behind Lucy trying to sneak up. Lucy, oblivious to the threat, rushes out of the house as Ray walks in to try and protect her. His face is sliced off by the figure\u0027s hand and as Lucy gets into her car, Ray\u0027s deformed spirit is tossed onto the hood of the car.Lucy goes to see Frank in his cell and tells him that Old Mrs. Bradley must be responsible for Debra\u0027s death. She\u0027s found his knife in her bedroom and she\u0027s crazy enough to do something like that. Frank is still in a quiet, depressed state. He hugs Lucy and he sees Cyrus and Stuart enter the room. But as he looks Lucy in the face, the number 41 glows on her forehead. He realises she is the next victim. The Reaper appears through the cell door and tries to kill her. With the help of Stuart and Cyrus, he tries to protect her in the confines of the cell. Lucy shouts for the deputy to come and unlock the door. Stuart is dissolved by the Reaper\u0027s sythe. As Frank hears the cell door unlock, he kicks the door into the deputy\u0027s head and knocks him out, so that he can escape with Lucy. Dammers walks around the corner and draws his gun. Lucy rushes up to him and tells him that Frank is crazy, as Cyrus battles the Reaper. Lucy uses a fire extinguisher to spray at Dammers to protect Frank. Cyrus\u0027s soul is taken by the Reaper and Frank takes Dammers\u0027s gun and runs out of the precinct with Lucy. He tells her that he must kill himself in order to become a spirit and protect her. He is ready to put a bullet in his head, but she tells him not to and instead helps him have a near death experience by means of hypothermia and using barbiturates to slow his heart rate.At the medical centre, Frank goes to sit in the cryogenics room and waits to slowly die as Lucy gets the equipment prepared to revive him within several minutes. But Dammers appears in the room armed with an uzi machine gun. He thinks Frank deserves to die for his supposed crimes and abducts Lucy to stop her from reviving him. Frank\u0027s spirit emerges from his dead body and the gateway to Heaven opens for him but he walks away to try and find Lucy. Dammers handcuffs Lucy in the back of one of the sheriff\u0027s cars and drives off. Frank pursues them. As he tries to get used to his abilities, he sees he Reaper rapidly jumping and flying through the town to try and approach Lucy in the car. Just as the Reaper launches onto the roof of the car, Frank flies down and knocks it onto the road. A car zooms down the road and crashes into Frank and smashes him into tiny pieces of ectoplasm. The Reaper approaches him with his scythe as Frank\u0027s spirit moulds back together. A truck approaches and rams straight into the Reaper and it is taken down the road clinging onto the front of the vehicle.Dammers takes Lucy to the graveyard and parks the car up. She desperately wants to get back to the medical centre to revive Frank\u0027s body but he tells her that he is not going to return her for several hours until there\u0027s no chance of Frank coming back. She shouts at him and he starts to freak out again.(Director\u0027s cut) As he tries to cover his ears with his hands, Lucy notices one of his wrists the swastika sign. He tells her that he was undercover with the Manson family for six months disguised as a hippy and he was used as the family\u0027s sex slave.He gets out of the car and walks several yards away and stands in front of the car breathing nervously and uncontrollably. He opens up his shirt and reveals his deeply scarred body.(Director\u0027s cut) He starts to reveal to her his experiences in the many bizarre undercover assignments over the years that he has been part of. All of the weird cults and sects he has had to be involved in, including drinking goat\u0027s blood. He says that he has suffered for his country.He says that the pain he has suffered in the different religious groups has its rewards and tries to prove that he has some psychic sensibilities. He and Lucy are both shocked as the car engine starts up. The gear stick and steering wheel move and Lucy knows that it\u0027s Frank. Frank starts to reverse the car away from Dammers as Dammers chases after it. Sergeant Hiles reaches in through the car window to grab Frank and throws him to the ground. The car crashes into a sarcophagus and coffins fall out. The Reaper approaches and slices Hiles in half with its scythe. Frank uses the sergeant\u0027s machine guns to shoot it. Lucy gets out of the car to get into the driver\u0027s seat and Dammers jumps out to grab her.She uses the skull from a skeleton to hit him and quickly gets in the car and drives off. While Dammers chases after her, Frank rips the Reaper apart with the bullets and turns it into pieces ectoplasm. He grabs the face of the Reaper and as he slams it down onto a grave a few times, the face gradually morphs into a human face and reveals itself to be Johnny Bartlett. He has returned from beyond the grave to continue his killing spree. Spirits start wandering around in the vicinity, all of who appear to be Johnny\u0027s victims satisfied that their deaths have been avenged. A spirit with the number 1 carved in his head approaches Frank and tells him he was a doctor and the first of the victims. He thanks Frank for what he\u0027s done. But while Frank is distracted, the pieces of Johnny\u0027s ectoplasm start to drip down into a tomb and gradually morph back together. Frank dives down into the ground and wrestles with him. He picks up the scythe and as he brings down the handle onto the ectoplasmic figure, Johnny\u0027s full human formed spirit is revealed. Frank is just about to destroy him with the scythe but Lucy revives his body with chest plates. He wakes up panting for breath. He tells her that Johnny\u0027s back and that she needs to go and get Patricia out of the house and save her from him.Lucy arrives at the house but her mother tells her that there\u0027s no way her daughter is going anywhere. Lucy confronts her about Frank\u0027s knife in her closet and the old lady angrily storms off upstairs. Patricia runs up after her. Lucy waits in the living room and moments later, Patricia comes back down and says that her mother is going with them. Lucy tells Patricia that Johnny\u0027s ghost has returned and is on the loose. She tells Lucy she knows and that his spirit often visits her. As Lucy stands in the doorway of the living room, Johnny appears behind her threatening to kill her. He says that she and Frank have been causing a lot of problems. Patricia goes to the kitchen and Johnny points to the knives on the wall. He wants to watch her kill Lucy.(Director\u0027s cut) Patricia repeatedly stabs the knife through Johnny\u0027s torso as they both laugh and become increasingly excited by it, almost in an arousing way.Lucy goes upstairs to see if Mrs Bradley is going with them. She sees her bedroom door open a jar and when she opens it she is horrified to see the old lady\u0027s dead body spread out on the bed covered in blood. Patricia pops up behind her and tries to stab her. Lucy tries to shut the door and the blade of the knife goes into it. Lucy punches her and they both grapple to the floor. Lucy gets up and runs out of the door, after she gets the key out of the lock and locks it from the outside. She sits on the landing stairs trying to get over the shock but bullets start exploding through the door. Patricia has got hold of her mother\u0027s pump action shotgun. Lucy tries to run down the stairs but Johnny\u0027s figure appears from under he rug and tries to strangle her. Frank arrives in time to save Lucy. He grabs hold of the rug and throws Johnny off of the landing. Patricia gets out of the bedroom firing at them maniacally. Frank and Lucy get into Patricia\u0027s bedroom and Johnny appears in the room through the portrait of her father. He tries to kill Lucy once again but Frank smashes the portrait onto the bed post and Johnny\u0027s spirit cries out as he is sucked into the urn on the bedside table. Frank puts the lid on and sees Johnny\u0027s name on the urn. He tells Lucy that they need to get to a chapel and get the ashes to the \"other side\". Realising that there\u0027s a chapel in the old psychiatric (now derelict) hospital, which is located just behind the Bradley house, the pair head off there on foot.They make their way into the murky looking building and walk through the hallways looking for the chapel. Patricia follows them armed. As Frank looks around, he starts to have psychic episodes where he is able to see the events that transpired on the fateful day when Johnny and Patricia went on their killing spree. He sees Johnny pushing a trolley around and he uncovers a gun and blows away the doctor who thanked Frank in the graveyard. He sees the teenage Patricia walking around with a knife ready to carve into the victims\u0027 foreheads. Through his flashbacks, Frank hears one of the doctors say that the chapel is on the fourth floor.Still believing Frank to be the murderer, Dammers enters the hospital. Frank and Lucy are forced to split up when Patricia appears in the hallways and starts shooting at them both again. Lucy has the urn but Dammers gets hold of her and throws her head into the wall. Lucy punches him and gets away from him and manages to get into the elevator before he can reach her. She starts going up to the fourth floor but it breaks down. Frank is still running upstairs and comes across the chapel. He hears Lucy cry. He tries to pry the elevator door open to no avail but she manages to pass him the urn through the door to take to the chapel.Frank puts the urn down to smash the door in but as he turns around he bumps into a statue of the Virgin Mary and it falls onto the table and sends the urn flying to the other side of the hall. Dammers catches it. Frank angrily and desperately asks for it back but Dammers opens it and releases Johnny\u0027s ashes. His spirit laughs as the dust breezes away. Frank picks up a metal bar ready to give Dammers a beating but Dammers pulls out a machine gun and shoots him in the arm. Facing away from him and holding his bloody arm, Frank sees Patricia walk around the corner in the distance ready to shoot him with the shotgun. Dammers orders him to turn around. Frank does and falls backwards as Patricia fires and the bullet blows Dammers\u0027s head off. Frank crashes through four wooden floors down onto the ground floor. Patricia starts to shoot at Lucy in the elevator. She avoids the bullets,and the elevator starts automatically going again. Bloodied, bruised and half unconscious, Frank starts to crawl along the floor of the vivisection room.(Director\u0027s cut) In his psychic flashbacks, Frank sees Johnny chasing the teenage Patricia around dead bodies as she screams \"please don\u0027t hurt me\". As they have a playful game of chase, covered in blood. He grabs her and they start making out on the coroner\u0027s trolley.Lucy makes it to the ground floor and rushes to Frank. But Frank is nearly unconscious. Patricia appears behind her and hits her over the head with the butt of the gun. Frank flashes back to the moment when his wife Debra died and he finally remembers exactly what happened in that moment. He sees The Reaper transform into Johnny as he\u0027s stood over his wife\u0027s body and Patricia is holding his Stanley knife.Patricia points the shotgun at Frank, ready to kill him but she is out of bullets. She kicks him and lifts him up off of the floor with the gun around his neck. Lucy tries to help but Johnny is pinning her down. Frank struggles with Patricia but Patricia has the advantage and she strangles him to death. Frank\u0027s dead body drops to the floor, as Lucy cries out. Johnny excitedly waits for Patricia to take Lucy\u0027s life as well. She picks up an axe from the vivisection area ready but Frank\u0027s spirit jumps out at her and rips Patricia\u0027s spirit from her body and takes her through the tunnel to the \"other side\". Johnny chases him up through the tunnel of light, and as they get half way through, he manages to pull her away from Frank\u0027s grasp. Frank carries on floating towards Heaven, as Johnny and Patricia stay hovering in the middle of the tunnel. He shouts to Frank that they\u0027re returning to Earth to get some more victims. Frank is just about to leap down after them but a voice stops him. It\u0027s Cyrus with Stuart. Frank looks down at Johnny and Patricia as their laughing turns to fear and panic. The spiritual looking, electric like portal gradually turns into the inside of a huge worm, with dozens and dozens of smaller worms wrapping themselves around them,strangling them and gouging out their eyes. The huge worm swallows them up and takes them down into the burning flames of Hell. Frank watches in disbelief and turns around to have a look around Heaven. Cyrus and Stuart tell him that it\u0027s really something. Frank sees his wife Debra approach him smiling. She tells him it\u0027s time to go home. The higher powers have said that it\u0027s not his time to die yet. Cyrus pushes him and he starts to float along the clouds. He wakes up in the derelict hospital in Lucy\u0027s arms.He demolishes his old house in order to start a new life with Lucy. Walt pulls up and tells Frank that the investigation is over. They found a stash of Ouija boards at the house and Patricia was using them to bring Johnny back from the dead. Her mother was trying to do her best to keep her sedated but there was no chance of her stopping Johnny. As Walt gets into his car and drives off, Frank sees the ghost of Dammers in the back seat. To his surprise Lucy can see him as well. She says to Frank \"sometimes when you\u0027ve had a traumatic experience it can alter your perception\".

The next scene is set in Persia during the year 1127 A.D. with the Djinn asking a Persian emperor to make his second wish. The emperor asks the Djinn to show him wonders. The Djinn uses his powers to torture and mutilate people in the palace. Before the emperor can make his third wish, Zoroaster, a sorcerer (Ari Barak), interrupts and states that upon the third wish granted to the one who woke the Djinn, a gateway will open between the worlds and the evil race of Djinn can live on earth. The sorcerer then reveals a fire opal. The Djinn is sucked into the jewel, where he remains captured.In present day America Raymond Beaumont (Robert Englund) is supervising workers as they lower a box containing an antique statue of Ahura Mazda onto a ship\u0027s deck. The worker who is lowering the crate is drinking on the job and accidentally drops it from his crane, killing Beaumont\u0027s assistant (Ted Raimi) and destroying the statue. It breaks open and a dockworker finds the fire opal inside which he steals and pawns. The jewel ends up at Regal Auctioneers, where boss Nick Merritt (Chris Lemmon) gives it to appraiser Alexandra Amberson to examine. Her examinations of the jewel wake the Djinn.Thinking she saw something inside the jewel, Alexandra takes it to her labworker best friend and potential love interest, Josh Aickman (Tony Crane) to analyze. Later, as he is collecting data, light reflections cause the gem to explode and the Djinn is released. The lab is destroyed and Josh is killed, upon his wish for relief from his physical pain.Alex, thinking the gem has something to do with the explosion and subsequent death of Josh, tracks down Beaumont, to whom the statue belonged. Beaumont tells Alex to visit a folklore professor named Wendy Derleth (Jenny O\u0027Hara) to find out more about Ahura Mazda and the gem. He also invites Alex and her sister, Shannon (Wendy Benson) to a party he is hosting.The folklore professor tells Alex about the jewel, the Djinn, and its evil history. Later, Alex learns that the Djinn needs to power the gem with the soul of humans, and then grant her three wishes before he can unleash the Djinn on Earth. During this time, the Djinn, who had been in demonic form removes the face of a corpse in the morgue, taking on the dead man\u0027s form and the name Nathaniel Demerest. The Djinn, now as Nathaniel, goes about granting people wishes in return for their souls while he searches for Alex. He finally tracks down Alex\u0027s boss and grants him a greed-inflicted wish so that he can get Alex\u0027s address.Alex is haunted by visions whenever the Djinn grants a wish. She goes to Wendy\u0027s house to consult with her again, but Nathaniel has already killed her and taken her form. During their conversation, Alex realizes she is really talking to the Djinn. He confronts her and asks her to make three wishes. He even gives her a \"test\" wish. She uses this wish and orders the Djinn to kill itself. He complies by blowing his head off with a gun, yet the wound heals instantly; as the Djinn is immortal, he cannot be killed. Alex then uses the first of the \"official\" three wishes: Her first being to know her opponent, the Djinn. He teleports her to his terrifying world within the gem, thus demonstrating his true nature to her. Next, she wishes herself back to her apartment, alone. The Djinn had been threatening Alex\u0027s sister, so Alex sets about finding Shannon. She races to Beaumont\u0027s party and Nathaniel follows. While talking to Nathaniel at the party, Beaumont makes the mistake of wishing his party would be unforgettable, and Nathaniel begins wreaking havoc by causing the art pieces to kill the guests.The Djinn finally corners Alex and traps Shannon, trying to scare Alex into making the ultimate third wish. Alex wishes that the dockworker had not been drinking on the job two days ago undoing the events that followed (and presumably reviving the Djinn\u0027s victims back to life) and trapping the Djinn in the opal. The dock scene is shown again and the now sober operator has no trouble lowering the crate containing Ahura Mazda. Alex goes to see Josh at the lab. He notices that Alex is strangely pleased with herself, but she will not say why.Back on the statue of Ahura Mazda, which is now in Beaumont\u0027s private collection, the camera zooms inside the jewel and shows us the Djinn on a throne, waiting to be released.","numvotes":"23000","primarytitle":"Wishmaster"},"color":"rgb(76,80,97)","size":3.0},{"source":"Thriller","target":"tt9731534","id":"6560","attributes":{"notes":"Orientalism","runtimeminutes":"107","sex of killer":"male","synopsis":"Beth has just lost her husband Owen to suicide.

She insists on continuing her regular job as a teacher and tries to seem stable and in control much to the concern of her friend Claire and neighbor Mel. An ominous suicide note left by Owen where he claimed that \"There is nothing. Nothing is after you. You\u0027re safe now\" continues to perplex Beth.

While going through Owen\u0027s belongings, Beth finds floor plans for a reverse of their lake house.Beth also discovers a photo on Owen\u0027s phone of a woman who looks very similar to her. She suspects Owen was having an affair and is asked by Claire to stop digging into Owen\u0027s past. After a night out with Claire and their coworkers, a drunken Beth reveals that she died for four minutes in a car accident years ago and saw that there was nothing when she died. Owen always disagreed with this and was close to changing her mind before he died. Beth also states that she suffered from depression and that Owen began sleepwalking a year ago, expressing concern that she somehow passed her negative emotions to him. That night, Beth is awoken by a supernatural presence and witnesses several frightened women fleeing through the woods. Investigating, she finds blood on the boat where Owen shot himself and feels an invisible presence.Traversing across the lake to investigate a strange set of lights, Beth discovers a reversed, identical copy of her and Owen\u0027s house and sees ghostly figures of women with Owen.

Confederate troops led by a man named Jasper (Jack Huston) bring in a few runaway slaves. One of them, Amara (Achok Majak), runs away again in terror after watching the other men strap a device to another slave, Eli (Tongayi Chirisa). Jasper chases after Amara on horseback and brings her down by lassoing a noose around her neck. She begs to be killed instead of returned to the antebellum, and Jasper obliges her by shooting her in the head.One of the captured women, Eden (Janelle Monae), is brought into the home of her owner, a Confederate general known only as \"Him\" (Eric Lange). He beats Eden and orders her to say her name. When she cannot, Him grabs a branding iron and burns it into her back, causing her to scream in agony before weakly crying out her name.Six weeks later, a new group of black people are brought in to the plantation. Jasper orders the group to not speak unless they are given permission. Jasper\u0027s wife Elizabeth (Jena Malone) brings her daughter (Arabella Landrum) to pick one of the women in the group, whom the little girl names Julia (Kiersey Clemons). When Eden takes Julia with her, she asks Eden where they are and what is happening, but Eden tells her to keep quiet.Eli goes to Eden\u0027s house later to ask when they can escape again, but Eden appears to have given up hope. She walks carefully across the floor to see which boards do not make noises when stepped on. Julia then goes to her home, where she seems to already know who Eden really is. She wants to try and escape as well, as she is pregnant, but Eden shows her the branding scar to show that it is better not to anger the people in charge. Julia expresses disappointment in Eden, saying she is not a leader.The slaves are forced to work during a gathering of Him and his troops, where he boasts about preserving their way of life for the future. Two young soldiers, Purcell (T.C. Matherne) and Daniel (Robert Aramayo), observe Julia, and Daniel expresses attraction toward her. Purcell encourages him to speak to her, and Jasper comes in and orders Julia to wait in Daniel\u0027s cabin. When Daniel goes to find her later, Julia tries to appeal to what she thinks is his innocent nature since he appeared to be kinder than the other men, but he proves to be just as terrible when he strikes Julia for speaking to him without permission. He kicks her in the stomach before leaving.The next day on the plantation, Julia suffers a miscarriage. She cries out in pain and distress, and Eden goes to help her. Jasper attempts to antagonize them, but Eli keeps him back briefly by calling him a cracker. After letting Eden help Julia, Jasper confronts Eli over the matter, with the other soldiers getting ready to fire if they need to, but he instead sends Eli to clean out the shed. There, he finds the burnt remains of Amara, which he recognizes from her cross necklace. Eli breaks down.That night, Eden tries to sleep. She starts to hear what sounds like a cell phone ringing. She then appears to wake up from what seemed like a bad dream. Here, Eden is revealed to be an author and activist named Veronica Henley, married to Nick (Marque Richardson) with a daughter, Kennedi (London Boyce), all of whom live in present day Atlanta, Georgia. Veronica is well noted for speaking out against the treatment of black Americans, causing her to butt heads with pundits. As she is preparing for an upcoming trip, she sits to have a video conference with another woman... and it\u0027s Elizabeth. She uses condescendingly racist dialogue while discussing Veronica\u0027s book and its themes. Elizabeth also describes herself as a \"talent scout\" while noticing Kennedi, which makes Veronica uncomfortable.After going off on her trip, Veronica meets up with one of her best friends, Dawn (Gabourey Sidibe), as she visits Veronica\u0027s hotel room. She expresses to Dawn some of her frustrations and insecurities with her home life. After Dawn leaves, a mysterious man arrives to bring Veronica flowers but won\u0027t say who they are from. Based on the note that\u0027s left, she assumes they\u0027re from Nick.Veronica steps out of her room and runs into her other close friend Sarah (Lily Cowles), who is joining her and Dawn later that night for dinner and drinks. Meanwhile, Elizabeth sneaks into Veronica\u0027s room, tries on her lipstick, and walks around the room to observe before turning the tag on her door so she won\u0027t get turn-down service. Veronica then attends a conference where she speaks before an audience of black women, all of whom are moved and inspired by her words. As she goes back up to her room, the girl that appeared to be Elizabeth\u0027s daughter is in the elevator with her and creepily tells her she shouldn\u0027t speak unless given permission, but Veronica thinks it\u0027s just a game.Veronica later joins Dawn and Sarah. On the ride to the restaurant, Veronica talks to Nick and thanks him for the flowers, but he says it must have been a fan. Dawn is abrasive toward the staff since she demands the best table and wine. During the night, an unseen man (implied to be Jasper) watches the women all night until he sends a vodka cranberry to Dawn. He then approaches her personally to compliment her, and while flattered, she takes the time to critique his attempt, since she thinks that drink pales in comparison to the wine they are celebrating with, but she gives the man her number just in case. The ladies then prepare to part ways, with Veronica heading into an Uber. Midway through the trip, Veronica gets a call from a woman who says she is her driver waiting outside the restaurant, but she thinks there\u0027s a mistake. Veronica then looks at the driver to see that it\u0027s Elizabeth. Jasper then appears from behind her to grab her. Veronica struggles to break free, but he ultimately knocks her out.Veronica wakes up back on the plantation, where she is still hearing the phone ring. Outside, Him - actually Senator Blake Denton - answers the phone and speaks to someone over how Nick has been all over the news with Kennedi searching for Veronica, and he promises to take care of it. Veronica pretends to be asleep while Denton says he won\u0027t let anyone take her away from him.The next day, Veronica finds that Julia has hung herself. In her despair, she decides that tonight will be the night that they escape. She waits until Denton has fallen asleep, and she manages to sneak outside quietly. Eli finds her and helps her get the cell phone to call for help. They try to make it to the cabin to get a signal, but Purcell and Daniel are out after drinking, forcing the other two to hide and drop the phone. Daniel picks it up, and after Purcell leaves, he stops to urinate. Eli cracks him in the face and leaves Daniel to choke on his blood while they get the phone. They try to make it to the cabin, but Denton attacks the two of them. A fight ensues with Eli hitting Denton to keep him off Veronica, but Denton kills Eli with a hatchet. Veronica hits Denton with a tea kettle before getting his phone. Denton steps out but Veronica stabs him in the gut with a bayonet. She unlocks his phone and manages to call Nick and let him know she is alive, and she sends him a location pin to give to the police. Veronica then goes to Eli\u0027s body and addresses him by his real name, Professor Tarasai.Veronica rolls Denton into a confederate flag and brings him to the shed. He weakly tells her that there will still be more like them, but she scoffs at him. As she goes to get a torch, Jasper finds her, but she tells him that Denton is hurt. Jasper and another guard run into the shed, where Veronica locks them in there and sets the logs on fire to burn all three of them to death. She then rides on horseback as the other soldiers give chase through the woods. After losing most of them, Elizabeth pursues Veronica on her horse. She taunts Veronica and states that Denton (who was really her father) personally picked Veronica because she went against his whole campaign and agenda, while Elizabeth picked everyone else herself. Veronica lassos a noose around Elizabeth\u0027s neck, but Elizabeth slashes at Veronica multiple times until Veronica gains the upper hand and beats Elizabeth\u0027s face. Veronica then rides the horse while pulling Elizabeth until she slams her head against a statue, breaking her neck.Veronica continues to ride as the sun rises and the soldiers continue their re-enacting. She rides outside the gates of the plantation, where it\u0027s revealed that Antebellum is a Civil War re-enactment park. Veronica rides out on her horse to find other people, just as the police arrive, and she appears relieved. The police and feds rescue the kidnapped black people and bulldoze Antebellum to the ground.","numvotes":"25050","primarytitle":"Antebellum"},"color":"rgb(92,73,83)","size":1.0},{"source":"Horror Only","target":"tt0098986","id":"7130","attributes":{"productioncompany":"Canal+","countriesoforigin":"France","averagerating":"6.3","titletype":"movie","notes":"Anthology collection","originaltitle":"Adrénaline","storyline":"The Blind, Anita Assal and John Hudson # 5.

While wealthy, charming, generally intelligent and very handsome, he is naive and easily manipulated. These faults lead to his spiral into sin and, ultimately, misery.While posing for a painting by his artist friend Basil Hallward (Lowell Gilmore), Dorian meets Basil\u0027s friend Lord Henry Wotton (George Sanders). Wotton is enchantingly cynical and witty, and tells Dorian that the only life worth living is one dedicated entirely to pleasure. After Wotton convinces Dorian that youth and beauty will bring him everything he desires, Dorian openly wishes that his portrait could age in his place, and that he could keep his youthful good looks forever. He makes this statement in the presence of a certain Egyptian statue, which supposedly has the power to grant wishes. When the portrait of Dorian is complete, Lord Henry hails it as a masterpiece and is surprised when Basil announces he will never exhibit it because he feels he put \"too much of himself\" into it. Basil is also concerned about Lord Henry\u0027s influence on the impressionable Dorian, who Basil considers a dear friend and an artistic muse. Basil gives the painting to Dorian, who proudly hangs it in his opulent home.One fateful night, Dorian visits a lower-class tavern, The Two Turtles, where he is given a prime seat for the night\u0027s entertainment. He is instantly charmed by the tavern owners\u0027 daughter, Sibyl Vane (Angela Lansbury), who performs a sweet singing routine during the lineup. Dorian is invited backstage after the show to meet Sibyl, and plays the piano for her in the empty tavern. Sibyl is flattered by the attention of such a handsome gentleman, and her mother (Lydia Bilbrook) encourages the relationship because of Dorian\u0027s wealth, but Sibyl\u0027s brother James (Richard Fraser) is suspicious. James tells his enamored sister in private that if this young man, whom Sibyl nicknamed \"Sir Tristan\" after a virtuous knight in Arthurian mythology, ever harms her, he will kill him. James is then deployed to Australia on a sailing mission.Dorian excitedly tells Basil and Lord Henry that he is engaged to the beautiful Sibyl Vane, and invites them to come with him to the tavern to hear her sing. Despite having heard Lord Henry\u0027s disdainful views on marriage, Dorian is so genuinely happy that Lord Henry\u0027s words no longer influence him. Basil sees this as a positive development, and after seeing Sibyl perform and making her acquaintance, encourages the engagement for the sake of Dorian\u0027s moral purity. Lord Henry, on the other hand, cannot resist exploiting his innate ability to influence his friends, and suggests that Dorian test Sibyl\u0027s worth with an \"experiment.\" Dorian invites Sibyl to his house that night and, when she prepares to go home, asks her to stay. Torn between love and honor, Sibyl nearly leaves, but cannot resist Dorian\u0027s charm. This meant that she had failed Lord Henry\u0027s test, and Dorian sends her an incredibly hurtful letter, accusing her of \"killing his love,\" and that she can have no part in his life henceforth. He sends her a sum of money for compensation, but Sibyl is emotionally destroyed.When Dorian returns home after abandoning Sibyl, he notices a slight change in the portrait Basil had painted of him. The mouth looks somehow crueler, and a cold unkindness is present in the face that had not been there before. When he wakes the next morning, the change is still visible. He feels immense guilt over how badly he had treated Sibyl, and hastily composes an apology letter in an attempt to redeem himself. Before he can deliver it, Lord Henry arrives with the news that Sibyl Vane had killed herself the night before. Dorian is initially devastated, but Lord Henry convinces him to not blame himself for the tragedy and invites him to the opera. Abandoning his grief, Dorian falls deeper into Lord Henry\u0027s teachings of \"new hedonism\", and goes to the opera with him that very night. Basil is surprised and worried when he witnesses Dorian\u0027s uncaring behavior in regard to Sibyl\u0027s death, and Dorian plans to dedicate his life solely to his own pleasure. Because the change in the portrait still disturbed him, Dorian has it covered with a screen and locked in his old school room at the top of the house, to which he keeps the only key.Eighteen years later, Dorian is nearing his fortieth birthday, but has not visibly changed since age twenty-two. His friends and neighbors are awestruck at his youthful appearance, but unsavory rumors constantly circulate about his strange behavior and acquaintances. Having taken Lord Henry\u0027s ideas to heart, Dorian\u0027s life consists largely of scandals with women, opium dens, and influencing other wealthy young men to adopt his hedonistic way of living. Over time, many of his friends lost their good standing in society, and women were shamed to be in his company. Dorian meets Basil again, who is preparing to catch a train to Paris, and invites him to his house. Basil expresses his concern about Dorian\u0027s behavior, and admits that in order to truly know what kind of man Dorian is, he would have to see his soul itself. Dorian grimly leads Basil up to the old school room to look upon his handiwork for the first time in eighteen years. Dorian removes the coverings from the hidden portrait, and Basil is horrified to see that the man in the painting has warped into a hideous, demon-like creature to reflect Dorian\u0027s multitude of sins. Basil begs Dorian to repent and change his ways, but Dorian feels a surge of anger toward Basil, blaming him for his miserable life because the painting was his own work. Dorian stabs Basil to death and locks his body in the school room with the horrible painting, in which blood has appeared on the hands of the twisted painted Dorian.The next morning, Dorian summons a former friend, Allen Campbell (Douglas Walton), whose reputation had since been ruined by his associations with Dorian. Campbell is a scientist specializing in anatomy and chemistry, and Dorian blackmails the highly reluctant man into disposing of Basil\u0027s body. The nature of the blackmailing subject is not revealed, but Campbell agrees to disintegrate Basil\u0027s body, and departs afterward looking shaken and disturbed.Basil\u0027s disappearance is talked about in London society for some time, but Dorian is never suspected. Among the few who have remained his loyal friends are Lord Henry and Gladys (Donna Reed), Basil\u0027s niece, who was a little girl when the portrait was painted. Dorian enters a romance with Gladys, though he is apprehensive about the effect he appears to have on the lives of those he becomes close to. He visits a seedy inn one evening and finds a former friend, Adrian Singleton (Morton Lowry), a wealthy young man who had been ruined by following Dorian\u0027s influence. Adrian is now a disheveled opium addict, but he knows of Dorian\u0027s sordid past and mockingly addresses him as \"Sir Tristan\" as Dorian departs the inn. The nickname is overheard by James Vane, Sibyl\u0027s brother, who happened to be at the inn and had spent eighteen years being hell-bent on avenging his sister. Though he did not know her cruel suitor\u0027s name and had never seen his face, the name \"Sir Tristan\" is enough to motivate him to follow Dorian outside and threaten him. Dorian calmly denies ever knowing a Sibyl Vane, and asserts that he is too young to have had anything to do with a death that occurred eighteen years before. James Vane admits that this man looks too young to be the suspect, and releases him. Adrian Singleton, with both amusement and resentment, explains to James that Dorian Gray was the man he sought, and that he had not looked a day older than twenty-two for the past eighteen years. Enraged, James Vane begins to track down Dorian Gray.A few days later, Dorian attends a hunting party with several society friends. The sport is interrupted when a man, assumed to be a beater, is shot to death by accident after hiding in the bushes unseen. It is revealed to Dorian later that the dead man was not a beater, but James Vane, having followed Dorian in revenge and lost his own life in the process. Dorian feels even more guilty and cursed, but wishes to make one final stab at having a good and worthwhile life. He soon proposes marriage to Gladys, who happily accepts, much to the displeasure of her friend David Stone (Peter Lawford), who is one of the many who are suspicious of Dorian.Despite his happiness about his upcoming marriage to Gladys, Dorian is weighted down by the deaths of Sibyl, Basil, and James, as well as the ruin of Adrian Singleton and others like him. The last straw is the news that Allen Campbell, whom Dorian ruined and then blackmailed into disposing of Basil\u0027s body, had killed himself in misery. Dorian realizes that the one noble thing he can possibly do is to spare Gladys from the certain misfortune he will bring her.At long last, Dorian ventures up to the school room to face the painting that is the embodiment of his corrupted soul. Using the same knife with which he had murdered Basil Hallward, he stabs his painted figure through the heart. Dorian himself feels the effect of the knife, and collapses, praying for his salvation. Roused by his screams, his houseguests, including Gladys, David, and Lord Henry, rush upstairs and find Dorian Gray\u0027s dead body on the school room floor, now in the form of the hideous creature from the painting. The painting itself, with the knife still protruding from it, has reverted to its original image of the handsome, innocent youth than Dorian once was. Lord Henry, stricken, sees the horrible results of his own influence and gazes at Dorian\u0027s corpse in shocked remorse.","numvotes":"12975","primarytitle":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","productioncompany":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM)","countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"7.5","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","sex of artist":"male","storyline":"In 1886, in Victorian London, the corrupt Lord Henry Wotton (George Sanders) meets the pure Dorian Gray (Hurd Hatfield) posing for talented painter Basil Hallward (Lowell Gilmore).

Now as the movie opens, they are attending the wedding of Ralph Hapschatt (Jeremy Newson) and Betty Monroe (Hilary Labow) in which Brad is Ralph\u0027s best man and Janet is the maid of honor. Inspired by the events around him, as soon as the other guests leave, Brad asks Janet to marry him in a song (\u0027Damnit Janet\u0027) inside the church and she accepts. Joyous, the couple decide to go tell Dr. Scott the good news.Appearing all through the movie, a Criminologist (Charles Gray) comes on and explains that we are about to embark on a strange journey following the misadventures of Brad and Janet. He mentions that despite the storm clouds gathering, the two decided to go for a long drive in the country anyway even though their spare tire was badly in need of air. He claims that Brad and Janet will have \"a night to remember for a very long, time.\"Back to Brad and Janet, as they drive on, the sun sets and, sure enough, it begins to rain very heavily. Janet is starting to feel ill at ease considering how far out they are and that a bunch of bikers keep passing them on the road and suggests that they should turn back before something bad happens. We hear a loud BANG! and the car skids to a stop.Brad realizes he messed up badly by not refilling the spare tire and suggests that the two of them go to an old castle they passed along the way to call for help. Janet isn\u0027t so sure this is a good idea, but Brad talks her into it anyway as there\u0027s not much they can do otherwise. As they walk through the rain, Janet tries to shield herself with a newspaper, telling herself through a song that no matter how bad things get, there\u0027s always a good side and that things will always get better. (\u0027There\u0027s a Light... over at the Frankenstein Place\u0027)Soon the two arrive on the front doorstep of the castle. Brad knocks and just as the two were about to leave, the door is opened by Riffraff (Richard O\u0027Brien), a tall, gaunt, balding butler in a stark black suit. He glares at them, further unnerving Janet, though Brad tries to be friendly, introducing himself and Janet and explaining that they need a phone as their car has broken down nearby.The foyer is outlandishly decorated with dark wooden furniture, stuffed dead animals and hunting trophies, and random relics and curiosities. Riffraff explains to Brad and Janet that they\u0027ve arrived on a very special night as \"the master\" is having a party, where Brad and Janet meet the equally strainge house maid Magenta (Patricia Quinn), which leads into the infamous song \"The Time Warp\".The Criminologist comes on and explains the steps to the \u0027Time Warp\u0027 dance.Brad and Janet are ushered into a great hall with a throne and a jukebox at it\u0027s far end where conventionists of every size and description wearing tuxedos and party hats are dancing and singing the (\u0027Time Warp\u0027). During the song we are introduced to the gold-sequin-wearing, tap dancing Columbia (Little Nell). All of this is too much for Janet and Brad who try to sneak out carefully. Janet begs Brad to leave as the place is creepy, but Brad simply says that they should stay to watch more \"folk dancing.\" Janet refuses as she\u0027s \"cold, wet and just plain scared!\", though Brad tries to reassure her.Janet turns around to leave and sees Dr. Frank N. Furter (Tim Curry) in full drag regalia, wrapped up in a black cloak. She screams and faints. Frank introduces himself though a song as a (\u0027Sweet Transvestite\u0027) from Transsexual, Transylvania\". Brad asks him for help, explaining his plight, and Frank smirks and acknowledges that yeah, Brad needs help, and offers him a mechanic at first only to change his mind as \"Maybe the rain isn\u0027t REALLY to blame\" and instead decides to \"remove the cause but NOT the symptoms.\"Frank then goes into an elevator and rises upstairs to the applause of the partying conventionists. Riffraff and Magenta strip Brad and Janet down to their underwear. Brad and Janet then are prodded into the elevator and taken upstairs to Frank\u0027s laboratory.Brad and Janet are led out into the center of an observing room where they are put on display by Dr. Frank N. Furter, now wearing a lab coat and long surgical gloves. The Transylvanian conventionists watch the events from an above balcony. Frank N. Furter then walks over to a box-like shape covered by a tarp and throws off the covering to reveal a tank. He shouts for Magenta and Riffraff to set the controls and start the machinery as the room darkens. Frank himself laughs maniacally as he turns knobs, dials, and wheels as fluids pour into the tank and a humanoid form appears slowly, skeleton first, much to Janet and Brad\u0027s terror.Carefully, Frank N. Furter leads out the humanoid figure wrapped entirely in bandages and cuts them away to reveal a full-grown man with blond hair, tanned skin, blue eyes and a muscular figure wearing only a skimpy golden bikini over his crotch. Riffraff spins some wheels he shouldn\u0027t have while cackling to himself, setting the blond man, known as Rocky Horror (Peter Hinwood), loose. Frank chases Rocky through the lab crying his name as a bouncy song about the creation (\u0027I Can Make You a Man\u0027), Rocky feeling a sense of dread plays. Eventually Frank catches Rocky and scolds him for misbehaving, but says he forgives him as he\u0027s beautiful (\u0027Sword of Damocles\u0027).Then, the deep freeze malfunctions and Columbia squeals, \"Eddie!\" A burly, heavyset biker named Eddie (Meatloaf) rides out on a motorcycle, dressed in black leather, singing about his former glory (\u0027Whatever Happened to Saturday Night?/Hot Patootie\u0027) The conventionists eat it up, enjoying the show, but Frank becomes wrathful that Eddie stole his thunder and takes out a pickax, chasing Eddie into the deep freeze where he is hacked to bits. This puts everyone, even the giddy conventionists into a shocked and somber mood. Frank, tires to pick things up by talking about how beautiful Rocky is in a song (\u0027I Can Make You a Man, reprise\u0027), leading away his new creation to a \"bedchamber\" in a wedding-style procession.The Criminologist comes on again and mentions that Brad and Janet are in trouble now as they are being led away to separate rooms for the night.While separated, Frank N. Furter comes into Janet\u0027s bedroom, dressed as Brad, and seduces Janet. Then he goes into Brad\u0027s room, dressed as Janet and tries to seduce Brad. Brad puts up a little bit of a fight, but is talked into it. Afterwards, Janet feels frightened and used and goes to look for Brad. Meanwhile, Rocky escapes from the bedchamber and is running loose, chased by dogs through the rain outside the castle by the gleeful Riffraff. While wandering the castle lost and afraid, Janet encounters Rocky hiding in his tank at the lab. Seeing that he\u0027s injured, she tears her petticoat to bandage his wounds, pausing as she realizes she\u0027s aroused.The Criminologist comes on and mentions the complexity of human emotions and the dangers of lust. He fades away to Magenta and Columbia who are secretly watching Rocky and Janet in the tank via a monitor in their room.Janet tries to seduce Rocky, explaining that she used to be a virgin, but now she finds she really likes sex and wants it NOW (\u0027Toucha Toucha Touch Me\u0027). Rocky is more than happy to oblige. Meanwhile, Columbia and Magenta watch in secret from the closed circuited TV, laughing and playing with one another, making fun of the events unfolding before them.As the two women enjoy one another, Frank N. Furter beats up Riffraff for letting Rocky loose, while Brad watches with horror. An alarm goes off and Riffraff looks on another TV monitor and mentions that someone is outside by the main gate as they all look and see a middle aged man in a wheelchair buzzing the intercom at the front gate. Dr. Everett Scott (Jonathan Adams) has arrived at the castle. Brad recognizes his old teacher and is happy to see him, but Frank N. Furter is angry that the two know one another, recognizing Dr. Scott as a federal agent investigating UFOs, suspecting Brad and Janet are actually spies. Brad denies this, explaining that Dr. Scott is his science teacher from Denton High, but Frank doesn\u0027t believe him.Meanwhile, Dr. Scott enters the castle and finds himself alone in the \u0027zen room\u0027 filled with various smoldering insence. Frank N. Furter takes Brad to the lab where he turns on a powerful magnet to drag Dr Scott\u0027s wheelchair up to them... with Dr. Scott still inside it. The clunk of Dr. Scott\u0027s wheelchair arriving wakes the sleeping Janet and Rocky who sit up in shock. Everyone in the room is frightened, confused and hurt to see one another here. Magenta appears up and announces that dinner is ready. Attempting to handle things with grace, Dr. Frank N. Furter dismisses everyone for dinner, informing them that formal attire is optional as he stomps off enraged.Everyone meets in a grand dining room for a dinner of roasted beef and vegetables in honor of Rocky\u0027s Birthday. Frank demands that everyone sing Rocky \"Happy Birthday.\" Dr. Scott reveals in a song (\u0027Eddie\u0027s Teddy\u0027) that he\u0027s not here to investigate Frank and his household, but to look for his nephew, Eddie, who went missing with a cryptic cry for help in a letter being the last contact he had from him. Sure, Eddie was a no good kid, but he\u0027s still family. In response to this, the tablecloth is pulled off the table to reveal Eddie\u0027s hacked-up body in a glass case... and the fact that they were being served roast Eddie for dinner. Brad and Dr. Scott are paralyzed with terror, and Janet runs to Rocky\u0027s arms. Frank is outraged, slapping Janet. Janet runs away with Frank chasing after her, encouraging her through a song (\u0027Once in a While\u0027) to stop sleeping with everyone else as she\u0027s now his.Janet, followed by Frank N. Furter, Rocky, Brad, and Dr. Scott end up in the lab again. Frank pulls a switch to \"glue\" everyone\u0027s feet to the floor but his. Everyone tells Frank he\u0027s a \"Hot dog.\" In response, he simply flips a switch and turns them all to stone. Columbia comes in and tells Frank he\u0027s gone too far this time as now people are really hurt. Frank N Furter simply responds by turning Columbia to stone, too. He then tells Riffraff and Magenta to prepare for the floor show.The Criminologist comes on and hints that in this place where nothing\u0027s as it seems, the Floor Show is going to be something very shocking.The next scene we see the statue versions of everyone on stage, now all wearing fishnets, makeup, a thong and the same bustier. One by one they are unfrozen, and they each sing and dance a song (\u0027Floor Show\u0027) about how they\u0027ve changed since they came here. Rocky and Columbia sing about their past times (\u0027Rose Tint My World\u0027). Frank N. Furter, Brad and Janet sing their own version (\u0027Fanfare/Don\u0027t Dream It\u0027). Dr. Scott is accidentally unfrozen and realizes that this place is a trap and everyone should run while they still are sane enough to escape. Frank N. Furter comes out like a prized showgirl and sings a solo, starting an orgy in a swimming pool that is uncovered as he sings. After the orgy, Frank N. Furter sings a song praising his wild and untamed household (\u0027Wild and Untamed Thing\u0027).This song, however is interrupted by Riffraff and Magenta, now wearing strange uniforms and armed with laser ray guns. Riffraff informs Frank that it\u0027s all over as his mission was a failure due to Frank becoming too extreme. He declares that Frank is now his and Magenta\u0027s prisoner as he has been made commander, and that they\u0027re going back to their home planet of Transylvania in the Galaxy of Transexual immediately. Frank is happy for this, singing about how long he\u0027s been wanting to go back to the homeland he was exiled from (\u0027I\u0027m Going Home\u0027). Riffraff stops him again and explains that only he and Magenta are going home; Frank N. Furter is to be killed as Riffraff replies: \"say hello to oblivion\". Riffraff points a ray gun at Frank, but Columbia screams in an attempt to save Frank. Riffraff quickly turns around and kills her. Riffraff then kills Frank as he tries to run away. Rocky, seeing his creator fall, grabs Frank and climbs the set in the background of the stage, crying in rage and pain. It takes several shots from the ray gun, but Rocky is killed and falls into the pool where he and his creator float dead.Riffraff turns to Brad, Janet and Dr. Scott and tells them to leave now while they still can and they do so. Meanwhile, in a now empty house, Magenta and Riffraff celebrate going home as an incestuous relationship is implied. Brad and Janet, carrying Dr. Scott, escape just as the castle explodes and flies away under a rainbow and blue skies of dawn back to Riffraff and Magenta\u0027s home planet, leaving Dr. Scott, Janet, and Brad writing on the charred ground, still in drag from the floor show as it flies away into space. (In some versions the three of them sing one final song about loss of innocence called \u0027Superheros\u0027.)The Criminologist comes back one last time with the somber, iconic lines describing the flying away of the house:\"And crawling... on the planet\u0027s face... some insects... called the human race.

He is come across by Edward \"Ed\" Reid (Marc Price) who lives in the same house renting the flat under Lionel\u0027s. While Ed is friendly, Lionel seems to be keen in avoiding any kind of human contact. Right after this event, George (Jerry Levitan)and his thug (-----------------) show up to threaten Lionel, because he owes them 200 dollars, presumably for rent. They are going to cut his fingers but Ed Reid, who had hidden himself and tried to stay out of it, makes some noise and is seen. Ed ends up paying Lionel\u0027s debt with a cheque, and the thug requests that he signs an autograph for him, as Ed Reid is quite a famous writer. Next week, Lionel will have to pay again. Lionel is a bit hurt, but he is more worried about not speaking to Ed than anything else. Lionel says that he will give him his money back soon.Back home, Clara calls him on. He tells him off, because he is constantly messing everything up. Clara is crazy for having a perfect carpet. Her attitude is totally opposite when Ed tells her that he won\u0027t be able to pay rent that week. She tells him not to worry about that, because she loves the sexy way he writes. She also flirts with him, and shows him kinky underwear and a whip. She wants him to describe her aloud. She likes it, but she wants some more, to be described as he describes Laura, the sexy flight attendant. She insists in being described later on, and tells him that they are arguing about the rent. Ed says that he only writes filthy stories because it is better than working at McDonald\u0027s.Doc Clapton (Russ Tamblyn) takes Ed to a par, and he introduces him to some poor homeless people who are being fed.

Ed comes back and doubts what happened.In a rubbish bag he sees the lemon fizzy drinks Lionel bought. Ed knocks on Lionel\u0027s apartment. Ed says that there is a leak in his apartment, so he wants Lionel to check it. Lionel closes the door on Ed while checking the supposed leek.Ed comes in uninvited.

They kiss just in case they won\u0027t see each other ever again. Lionel turns off the light on his apartment.The door is unlocked and Ed comes in. Lionel attacks Ed and Lynn saves him. Both try to run away but the gargoyles scare him. They try to reason with them,saying that they were going to look for a doctor. Ed writes for the new gargoyle. Doc is leaving his practice and has already been drinking, so when he sees the gargoyles he thinks he is drunk. He doesn\u0027t freak out and the gargoyles shoot a photograph of him with his volunteer friend. A gargoyle with an automatic bazooka gives Doc Ed\u0027s letter. Doc goes to help Lionel, who has concussion. Doc writes the name of a medicine. Two of the gargoyles go find the medicine; they also mess everything up. Doc has given Lionel a tranquilizer, as there is nothing wrong with him.The three of them attack the gargoyles. Ed stabs a gargoyle but the big sculpture calls for the rest. Ed finds Lionel\u0027s diary in his computer. The secret ingredient is lemon fizzy drink. Lionel used to be a computer genius geek. Another scene has Lionel going crazy.Doc gives Lionel some lemon fizzy drink as an experiment. Lionel throws up blood and clay - that is the material for creating the little devils. There was a little part of his brain that the gargoyles haven\u0027t taken over because Lionel hid it, albeit showing it in the recorded message at the computer. The lemon fizzy drink kills the gargoyle. One of the ones which crawl through the ventilation shaft gets killed like that. They kill the gargoyle stabbed to the wall and the one enclosed in a metallic container with lemon fizzy drink. There are four more gargoyles, but they only have two cans.Lionel decides to go and fetch the lemon cans from Ed\u0027s apartment. Ed has to run after him with the keys. One gargoyle tries to kill Lionel, but Ed kills it. They prepare a lemon drink weapon while another gargoyle with acid shows up. They shower it with the lemon drink.Doc and Lynn wait meanwhile, but another gargoyle shows up. They hear the noise and stand up. One gargoyle shows up. Doc tells Lynn to hide away, even though she complains. Doc is killed with acid. He falls into the bathtub of bloody. Ed is aimed at by a gargoyle, but Ed kills it. Lynn calls out for Doc, but he doesn\u0027t reply back. Lynn moves around and so does the gargoyle. Lynn throws the lemon fizzy drink at the gargoyle, which becomes a gory mess. Another gargoyle shows up and Lynn ducks down - she has not more lemon cans. Fortunately, Lionel and Ed save her.Lionel realises that there is still one - the teacher, the big one. He smashes the sculpture with a pipe. That causes Doc to get out of the gory bathtub. Lynn sees Doc\u0027s attache and she inquiries where Doc is. Doc has become a huge deformed demon. Doc calls out to Lynn.Ed tries to protect her, who goes to Doc, but he suffers from electric shock. Lionel looks at his own videos. He reaches the conclusion that the devil is controlling Doc\u0027s body. They find Lynn close to the well. Doc Devil speaks nicely to him, saying that he is now in control.

She is being questioned by a doctor who shows her pictures of her family and asks if she can speak about the day that led her to being admitted to the hospital.The next scene shows her returning with her father and sister, Su-Yeon, to the family\u0027s secluded estate near a lake. The two sisters are reluctant to go inside the house where their stepmother awaits. Instead they go down to a pier by the lake where they relax by putting their feet in the water and enjoy the sunshine.Soon, they are called back to the house where they are greeted by the stepmother with a forced welcome. She chastises them for making her wait and taunts them by asking if they are feeling better after having been away. The two sisters are unresponsive and quickly leave to other parts of the house.At a tense family dinner, the stepmother announces she has invited the sister\u0027s uncle and his wife to dinner the next day. Su-Mi tells her stepmother she will not eat with them and the two sisters leave the table. Su-Mi tells Su-Yeon that if their stepmother ever goes after Su-Yeon to let her know.That night as Su-Yeon goes to sleep, she hears noises and the door to her bedroom creakily opens and a female hand sneaks around it. Su-Yeon pulls the covers over her head only to have them pulled back by an unseen force. Terrified, she runs out of her room to Su-Mi and tells her that someone has come into her room.When Su-Mi goes to investigate, she only finds her father sleeping, but her stepmom catches her and tells her not to wake him. She rejoins Su-Yeon and comforts her, telling her that she will always be with her and they fall asleep.Later, Su-Mi has a nightmarish dream about blood and a hand desperately slapping at the floor. She wakens to see something moving in her room. Crawling along the floor is the apparition of a woman whose face is covered by long black hair. The wraith becomes aware that Su-Mi is looking at her and she none too slowly floats over the top of her. The ghost is hanging in mid-air with blood running down her leg. A hand suddenly appears from under her dress. Su-Mi awakes with a start realizing everything she has witnessed was still a dream.Tension continues to rise among the three females as their menstrual cycles become synched together.Su-Mi finds several family photos which reveal that their stepmother was once a nurse her father worked with and apparently was also a live-in nurse for the girl\u0027s mother. Su-Yeon enters the room and Su-Mi discovers bruises on her arm, but when she angrily questions her if their stepmother was the cause, Su-Yeon refuses to answer and runs out. Su-Mi confronts her stepmother about Su-Yeons injuries. The stepmother angrily responds to Su-Mi by telling her that she is now the sister\u0027s mother and that they must accept it and bear the worst that life has to offer. She also questions if Su-Mi is feeling well.That night, the sister\u0027s uncle and his wife arrive for a visit. They dine with the father and stepmother, whose behavior is extremely exaggerated and odd. When she asks the uncle if he remembers a peculiar event he tells her he doesn\u0027t. She responds icily: \"Why don\u0027t you remember? Are you crazy?\"Suddenly, the uncle\u0027s wife starts to convulse. She is thrown to the floor and has a violent attack. When she recovers the uncle drives her home and she informs him that during her attack she saw a girl under the kitchen sink. The stepmother sees the girl too and tells the sister\u0027s father that ever since Su-Mi and Su-Yeon returned home weird things have been happening inside the house. The father seems unconvinced.The stepmother goes into Su-Yeon\u0027s room where she discovers that photos of her have been mutilated and her face has been scratched out. Enraged, she attacks Su-Yeon and throws her into a wardrobe closet and locks her inside and refuses to let the terrified girl out. When the stepmother leaves the room, Su-Mi suspecting something is wrong, enters the bedroom and releases her sister from the closet. Overcome, she comforts Su-Yeon and tells her that she is sorry, that she didnt\u0027 hear Su-Yeon\u0027s pleas for help and that this will never happen again.The father enters and asks Su-Mi why all these bad things have been happening since she returned. Su-Mi says that it\u0027s the stepmother to blame and that his new wife has been attacking Su-Yeon. The father tells her to stop it and screams at her that Su-Yeon is dead. Neither Su-Mi, nor Su-Yeon, is pleased to hear this news.The father makes a phone call and informs the other person that he/she must come to the house tomorrow. The next morning, the stepmother is shown dragging a large sack with something inside it into the house and she starts beating it with a stick. The noise awakens Su-Mi. When she gets up she finds a note from her father saying he will return to the house that afternoon.Su-Mi runs to find Su-Yeon and sees a trail of blood on the floor. Following it leads to the sack the stepmother dragged in earlier. Su-Mi thinks it is Su-Yeon inside, but she can\u0027t get the bag open. She goes to the kitchen to retrieve a knife and when she returns she finds that the sack has been moved to the wardrobe closet. She also finds that her stepmother is behind her ready to throw boiling water on her. A violent fight ensues between the two females and Su-Mi stumbles and is knocked unconscious. Her stepmother drags her to another part of the house and retrieves a garden statue.As Su-Mi regains consciousness, the stepmother asks her what brought them to this point and reminds Su-Mi of a conversation the two once had where the stepmother told her that one day Su-Mi would live to regret something and that no matter how hard Su-Mi would try to forget it, she would never be able to. The stepmother then proceeds to drop the statue on Su-Mi\u0027s head as the father returns.He finds an unconscious Su-Mi as well as the injured stepmother. He attends to the stepmother\u0027s injuries and leaves the room. When the door opens again, someone else enters: the real stepmother. How can this new person be the stepmother when the original stepmother is sitting right there looking at herself?The camera turns 360 degrees to reveal that Su-Mi has been in the house alone with her father the past few days and that the conversations and events she had previously had with Su-Yeon and her stepmother were the result of her schizophrenic mind.The father and real stepmother take Su-Mi back to the hospital and the stepmother returns to the house alone that evening. There she hears an odd noise upstairs in what was once Su-Yeon\u0027s bedroom. When she goes to investigate she encounters a ghost hiding in the wardrobe closet.Flashback scenes reveal that one day some time ago, the father visited the house with the stepmother after what was an apparent marriage, or engagement, to his mistress. His ex-wife, the uncle and the uncle\u0027s wife are also there. An argument results and the sister\u0027s real mother goes into Su-Yeon\u0027s room. When her daughter goes to sleep the mother hangs herself in Su-Yeon\u0027s wardrobe closet. The apparition Su-Mi dreamed of earlier was her hanged mother.In the reveal, Su-Yeon wakens and the door to her closet opens. When she looks inside she finds her mother hanged. She shakes the lifeless body in an attempt to revive it, but instead pulls the wardrobe closet down on top of her. There she suffocates, or is slowly crushed to death, by the weight of her mother and the closet. She desperately strikes at the floor with her hand and calls out for Su-Mi to help her.We also learn that the stepmother having heard something upstairs goes into Su-Yeon\u0027s room. There she discovers the turned over wardrobe, but apparently thinks it is the father\u0027s wife under the closet. She does nothing to help her and quickly leaves the room. She encounters Su-Mi and the two exchange words. The stepmother tells Su-Mi that Su-Mi will one day regret something and that she will not be able to make it go away. Su-Mi brushes past her and leaves the house. She hesitates and thinks about going back inside, but instead she goes for a walk down a pathway not knowing that her life has changed forever and that she won\u0027t be able to ever make the past events go away.","numvotes":"60965","primarytitle":"A Tale of Two Sisters"},"color":"rgb(92,73,83)","size":1.0},{"source":"Horror Only","target":"tt0278966","id":"6712","attributes":{"notes":"Vampire themes","runtimeminutes":"90","sex of killer":"male","numvotes":"11","primarytitle":"Banquete das Taras","productioncompany":"W.C.

The older nun goes through the door to find some kind of artifact, while the younger nun, Sister Victoria (Charlotte Hope) starts to pray. The older nun emerges attacked and bloodied, telling Victoria to run before she is pulled back into the darkness. Victoria runs toward a window as the attacker while clutching a key, the demon nun Valak (Bonnie Aarons), moves slowly but closer toward her. Victoria asks God for forgiveness before she jumps and hangs herself. Sometime later, her decaying body is discovered by a man simply known as Frenchie (Jonas Bloquet).The officials at the Vatican learn of Victoria\u0027s suicide, which is considered the ultimate sin. They enlist Father Anthony Burke (Demian Bichir) to investigate. He seeks out a young novitiate named Sister Irene (Taissa Farmiga), who currently acts as a teacher to young girls. The two get together and go to find Frenchie so he can take them to where he found Victoria\u0027s body.The three go to the abbey where Frenchie leads Burke and Irene to the ice box where he left Victoria\u0027s body. Frenchie points out that Victoria is sitting up when he left her body lying down. Burke pries Victoria\u0027s fingers open and finds the key in her hand. They then take her body to give her a proper burial. While walking back toward the abbey, Burke notices fresh blood on the steps where Frenchie found Victoria\u0027s body. They then go into the chapel but cannot enter the abbey yet. They meet the Abbess (Gabrielle Downey), who informs them that are engaging in a vow of silence for Victoria, and that they may enter the next day.Burke and Irene go to their rooms while Frenchie leaves. He walks past the dark woods and sees what looks like Victoria walking through the woods. He follows her and ends up attacked by a demon nun. Frenchie picks up a cross from the ground and walks away with it.Irene tells Burke about a series of visions she experienced as a child, all of which ended with her hearing the phrase \"Mary points the way\". Burke then recalls an incident in France in which he was summoned to exorcise a young boy named Daniel (August Maturo) that had been possessed. Despite Burke\u0027s efforts, the boy sustained fatal injuries from the exorcism, and Burke has been wracked with guilt ever since.Later that night, Burke is awoken by the sound of music. He goes out into the woods and sees what looks like a demonic version of Daniel. The vision comes to life and pushes Burke into a coffin before an unholy force buries him alive, leaving him with a bell to ring. Irene also wakes up and wanders the chapel before she sees Valak in the mirror trying to attack her. She runs outside and hears Burke ringing the bell. Soon, multiple bells around graves start to ring, but Irene manages to find Burke\u0027s coffin and she starts to dig him up. Before she can reach him, demon hands start to pull at him, but Irene manages to free him. Inside the coffin, Burke then finds a bunch of books on the occult.The next day, Burke and Irene go to the abbey, but only Irene is allowed to enter. She meets Sister Oana (Ingrid Bisu), who tells her that the nuns change shifts to pray to keep evil at bay. Oana hears about Irene seeing Valak, and Oana explains the demon\u0027s origin. When the abbey was built during the Dark Ages, a duke obsessed with the powers of Hell tried to open a rift to summon Valak, but several men found and killed the duke before Valak could fully emerge, keeping him trapped using an artifact (the same one the nuns from before were looking for) containing the blood of Christ. He remained sealed in Hell until bombs from World War II dropped around the abbey and broke the rift open, setting the demon loose. Oana explains that Valak takes the form of a nun to look like the rest of them and prey on their weaknesses. Meanwhile, Burke reads about Valak and learns his name.Frenchie is in a tavern where he hears that one of the patrons had a 12-year-old daughter that committed suicide by hanging after allegedly seeing something horrible. After Frenchie tells the bartender that he went up with Burke and Irene to the abbey, the bartender warns Frenchie that the two of them may be the next victims.Burke once again attempts to enter the abbey, only to encounter the Abbess again to tell him he won\u0027t find another way in. He tries to ask the Abbess about the key that he found with Victoria, but she tells Burke it\u0027s too late and that Irene is lost. Her body then appears to go limp. Burke tries to lift her veil to see her, but her demonic body grabs at him until he rips her hand off of him.Irene awakens after seeing another frightening vision of Valak. She wanders outside her room and is once again attacked by the demon nun. Burke hears the noise and tries to save her but he is also attacked until Frenchie shows up with a shotgun. Irene finds the other nuns and starts to pray alongside them as an evil force carves a pentagram into her back. Irene then sees what looks like Oana\u0027s dead body, but she quickly realizes that Oana and the other nuns were not real, but visions.The three reunite as they realize that Victoria was not trying to commit suicide, but rather sacrifice herself so that Valak could not possess her body and spread terror. They head into the catacombs to find the artifact with Christ\u0027s blood. Irene realizes that \"Mary points the way\" is in reference to the statue of Mary that literally points the way to where they may find the artifact. Sure enough, they come across the vial containing the blood after opening its chamber using Victoria\u0027s key. Soon, Valak reemerges and attacks the trio. He starts to try and possess Irene while Burke is attacked by the demonic Daniel. Irene is briefly possessed, but Frenchie manages to throw some blood on her to free her. Valak unleashes a dark force upon Frenchie, and then tries to drown Irene. He pulls her up and sees that the vial is broken. She spits the blood in Valak\u0027s face, sending the demon back to Hell and sealing the rift.As the trio leave the abbey, Irene asks Frenchie his real name, and he says it\u0027s Maurice. We then see an upside down cross burned into the back of Maurice\u0027s neck.The film concludes with a clip from the first \"Conjuring\" movie in the present day where Carolyn Perron (Lili Taylor) is watching Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) give a seminar on their encounter with the possessed Maurice, who later committed suicide. His contact with Lorraine caused her to see visions, and unfortunately for her, it would not be the last time that she encountered Valak.","numvotes":"135199","primarytitle":"The Nun"},"color":"rgb(65,97,106)","size":1.0},{"source":"Thriller","target":"tt2316204","id":"7064","attributes":{"runtimeminutes":"122","sex of killer":"unhuman","synopsis":"In a prologue, business magnate Peter Weyland speaks with his newly activated android, who chooses the name \"David\" after observing a replica of Michelangelo\u0027s statue of David. Weyland tells David that one day they will search for mankind\u0027s creator together. David comments on his own unlimited lifespan compared to his creator\u0027s limited one.In 2104, 11 years after the \u0027Prometheus\u0027 expedition, the colonization ship \u0027Covenant\u0027 is bound for a remote planet, Origae-6, with a crew of 15, two thousand colonists in stasis and 1,140 human embryos aboard. The ship is monitored by Walter, a newer android model that physically resembles David. A stellar burst damages the ship, killing 47 colonists. Walter orders the ship\u0027s computer to wake the crew, which includes several married couples. The ship\u0027s captain, Jake Branson, is burned alive when his stasis pod malfunctions. While repairing the ship, the crew picks up a radio transmission from a nearby, habitable planet. Against the objections of Daniels (Branson\u0027s widow), the new captain, Oram, decides to investigate.As the Covenant remains in orbit, an expedition team descends to the earth-like planet\u0027s surface and tracks the transmission\u0027s signal to a crashed alien ship. Crew members Ledward and Hallett are infected by alien spores. Oram\u0027s wife Karine helps the rapidly-sickening Ledward back to the lander where Maggie, the pilot, quarantines them both inside the med-bay. A small, pale, alien creature (neomorph) bursts from Ledward\u0027s back, killing him, and then kills Karine. Maggie attempts to kill the creature with a shotgun, but triggers an explosion which kills her and destroys the lander. The neomorph escapes while a similar creature bursts from Hallett\u0027s mouth.The neomorphs attack the remaining crew members and kill one. The crew manages to kill a neomorph before David, who survived the \u0027Prometheus\u0027 mission, scares away the other, and leads the crew to a temple in a city full of humanoid (Engineer) corpses. David tells them that upon his and fellow \u0027Prometheus\u0027 survivor Elizabeth Shaw\u0027s arrival at the planet, their ship released a black liquid bio-weapon which annihilated the native population and that Shaw died when the ship crashed in the ensuing chaos. After the crew members tell David of their mission, they attempt to contact the \u0027Covenant\u0027 but are prevented by fierce storms. The surviving neomorph infiltrates the structure and kills crew member Rosenthal. David tries to communicate with the creature, but is horrified when Oram kills it. Oram questions David who reveals that the aliens are a result of his experimenting, with the black liquid (formed from the blood of the first Deacon) and a facehugger egg found in the Engineer city, in an attempt to create a new species even more superior to himself, just as he believes himself superior to the humans that created him, and the humans to be superior to the Engineers. He manipulates Oram into being attacked by an alien facehugger. An alien creature (xenomorph) later erupts from Oram\u0027s chest, killing him.As the others search for Oram and Rosenthal, Walter, who has found Shaw\u0027s dissected corpse, confronts David. David explains that he believes humans are a inferior species and should not be allowed to colonize the galaxy. When Walter disagrees, David disables him, and threatens Daniels. Walter recovers (being a superior model capable of self-repair) and confronts David while Daniels escapes as they fight. A facehugger attacks security chief Lope, but he is later rescued by crew member Cole. The now fully grown Xenomorph appears and kills Cole, while Lope escapes and meets up with Daniels. Pilot Tennessee arrives in another lander to extract Daniels, Lope, and Walter, who claims David has \"expired\". After an encounter outside the ship, they kill the Xenomorph and return to the \u0027Covenant\u0027.The next morning, Daniels and Tennessee find out that another Xenomorph burst from Lope\u0027s chest, killing him, and is loose on the Covenant. It matures, and kills crew members Ricks and his wife Upworth. Tennessee and Daniels lure the creature into the Covenant\u0027s terraforming bay and flush it into space.The \u0027Covenant\u0027 resumes its trip to Origae-6, and the surviving crew re-enters stasis. As Walter puts Daniels under, she realizes that he is in fact David, but is unable to escape her stasis pod before falling asleep. David regurgitates two facehugger embryos and places them in cold storage alongside the human embryos before entering the cargo bay containing the colonists in stasis. He then poses as Walter to record a log stating that all crew members except Daniels and Tennessee were killed by the neutrino blast at the beginning of the film and that the ship is still on course for Origae-6.","numvotes":"272635","primarytitle":"Alien: Covenant","productioncompany":"Twentieth Century Fox","countriesoforigin":"United States, United Kingdom","averagerating":"6.4","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"Alien: Covenant","sex of artist":"male","storyline":"In 2104, almost eleven years after the disastrous expedition to the distant moon, LV-223, in Prometheus (2012), the deep-space colonisation vessel, USCSS Covenant, is on course for the remote planet, Origae-6, with more than 2,000 colonists in cryogenic hibernation to build a new world.

Hoagie crash lands the plane and, although at first it looks like the shark eats Hoagie, all make it to the boat safely. Jake and Michael realize they can use the radio tag and a big flashlight to shock the shark if it swims too close. Jake goes out on the gunwale to torment the shark with his magical invention but the shark leaps out of the water with a roar and snatches Jake into its jaws, breaking the gunwale.Ellen takes control of the ship\u0027s wheel. Michael uses Jake\u0027s magical invention to force the shark to roar like a tiger and leap from the water.

A solitary figure walks down the street holding an umbrella. We enter the Wax Museum with various tableaux of crimes of the past, and then enter the workshop where Prof. Henry Jarrod (Vincent Price) is working on a sculpture. His business partner, Matthew Burke (Roy Roberts) enters and walks partially upstairs when he is hailed by Jarrod. He tells Jarrod he\u0027s there to study the account books. They have a philosophical difference between their approaches to business. Jarrod proposes a buyout arrangement, and Burke either eager or desperate for the money agrees in principle. A potential investor is scheduled to see Jarrod that very evening.Bruce Allison (Phillip Tonge) and Sidney Wallace (Paul Cavanagh) arrive and are given a brief tour of the wax museum. Wallace is impressed, but Jarrod explains that he\u0027s never satisfied with certain aspects of the finished products. Wallace explains he\u0027s going to Egypt for three months, so no decision on investment can take place prior to his return. Allison and Wallace depart. Burke was eavesdropping from the upstairs room and heard everything. He is impatient for a financial settlement and proposes an insurance fire. The place is insured for $25,000--$12,500 each. Jarrod is horrified by the proposal, and opposes it categorically. Burke lights the Marie Antoinette wax figure\u0027s dress with a match. It starts a fire that Jarrod quickly extinguishes. Burke starts a few more fires, with Jarrod quickly working to save his wax figures. Burke and Jarrod fight, and at one point Jarrod is knocked out. Burke douses the workroom and display area with a flammable liquid and turns on the gas light spigots. He goes upstairs as the place begins to catch fire. He returns to the workroom and continues his fight with the now revived Jarrod. Jarrod works desperately with buckets of water to douse the fire, but it is a losing battle. He is knocked out again by Burke and left in the burning building. The gas ignites blowing out the front of the building. The police and fire departments respond.At a dance Burke is entertaining a young lady, Cathy Gray (Carolyn Jones). He tells Cathy he and Jarrod were friends and no trace of him was found after the fire. He confides to Cathy the insurance settled with a check this morning and he\u0027s already cashed it. Burke returns to his office, opens his safe and pulls out the money. Jarrod is there, horribly scarred from the fire wearing all black. He turns off the lights then attacks Burke with a rope. He takes the money, but before he can exit he hears the cleaning lady on the stairs. She continues down the stairs. Jarrod has something dramatic planned. He rigs a rope in the elevator, carries Burke to the elevator door, ties the loose end around Burke\u0027s neck and throws the body down the elevator shaft. The cleaning lady (Ruth Warren) screams when she discovers the dead body. It is meant to look like a suicide.At their boarding house Sue Allen (Phyllis Kirk) is helping Cathy get dressed for her evening out. Cathy expresses no sorrow for Burke, as she has found a new sugar daddy. Mrs. Flannigan (Riza Royce) confronts Sue upon her return from a job interview to get her back rent. Sue goes up to her room to get some money from Cathy. Cathy is dead and Jarrod is there in the room. She screams which brings the household upstairs. Sue leaves through an open window out onto the roof. Jarrod chases her down the street. She manages to slip him and calls for help at a house of an old friend. Mrs. Andrews (Angela Clarke) and her son Scott Andrews (Paul Picerni) bring her inside and she tells them Cathy was murdered and she saw the horrible visage of the murderer.The police investigate the murder at the rooming house. Lt. Tom Brennan (Frank Lovejoy) is lead and he is assisted by Sgt. Jim Shane (Dabbs Greer). The coroner (Frank Ferguson) determines Cathy\u0027s cause of death was strangulation. The surgeon (Grandon Rhodes) adds that she was drugged. Her body is taken to the morgue storage room where Jarrod is waiting under a sheet pretending to be a corpse. He\u0027s there to steal Cathy\u0027s body. With two accomplices below, he lowers her body out of a window with rope into a waiting hearse.The next morning, Mrs. Andrews, Scott and Sue come to the police station to give her report. Lt. Brennan tells them Cathy\u0027s body was stolen from the morgue. Before that, Mathew Burke\u0027s body and a few others were stolen from the morgue. He tells Sue not to leave town, but she is free to leave.Sidney Wallace is back in New York. He stops at a shop and is greeted by Igor (Charles Buchinsky/Bronson), a deaf-mute, and is escorted inside. Jarrod, looking as he did before the fire, greets Wallace sitting in a wheelchair. He tells Wallace he\u0027s rebuilding his exhibition from the ground up and will give the public what it wants, \"sensation, horror, shock.\" He adds, \"Crimes of violence will be reproduced in wax and exhibited while they are still fresh in the public mind.\" He is searching for a model for his new Marie Antoinette. He shows Wallace the basement with the wax body dip machinery. He asks Wallace to invest. He needs $30,000.The House of Wax opens for its debut. A man exits the lobby to work the crowd. The Barker (Reggie Rymal) has two paddle ball games. (Note: This was originally released as a Color 3-D movie.) He works the crowd into a frenzy by knocking things with the balls on the elastic. Jarrod greets Wallace and escorts him into the museum. He gives him the tour, along with some paying customers.Scott Andrews accompanies Sue on a tour of the Wax Museum. Wallace sees and recognizes Scott--he has been sponsoring him as a talented sculptor. Wallace wants to introduce Scott to Jarrod. While Sue wanders around she is surprised to see a Joan of Arc wax figure that looks exactly like her friend Cathy Gray. She climbs up on the tableaux to get a closer look. Jarrod sees this and approaches in his wheelchair. Sue asks, \"But why should it be so like Cathy?\" Jarrod responds, \"I think I can explain that.\" He tells her that he copied her face from newspaper clippings. Jarrod offers Scott a job, then tells Wallace he sees Marie Antoinette as Sue.Jarrod, without his makeup, goes to see Sue. He spies on her through her open window. She goes to bed. Jarrod steals into her room, but Sue wakes up and screams. Jarrod departs as Mrs. Andrews comes into her room to comfort her.Sue and Scott are at a Can-Can show having lunch. She is convinced there is something wrong about the Joan of Arc figure. Cathy had one ear pierced as does the wax figure. Such detail seems inconceivable. Scott tells Sue they\u0027ll talk to Lt. Brennan. Brennan listens to the story. To humor her, he agrees that the Police will investigate. He does confirm that someone matching Jarrod\u0027s description (with makeup) did ask to look at the photographs of Cathy\u0027s body. Brennan tells Sgt. Shane to check on Jarrod and his employees. They visit the Museum and examine the Joan of Arc. Sue stops by and climbs up on the wax figure again to touch the face. Jarrod catches her again. Jarrod shows Sue a wax head of herself. He tells her he needs her to model for his Marie Antoinette. Before Brennan and Shane leave, they notice some of the wax figures resemble people who have recently died. Shane also thinks he recognizes one of Jarrod\u0027s sculptors, Leon Averill (Nedrick Young).Wallace was waiting outside Brennan\u0027s office for Brennan and Shane to return. They arrive and ask him some questions about Jarrod. Before he leaves he vouches for Jarrod. Shane then remembers Leon as an artist imprisoned at Sing-Sing. He was then known as Hendricks and was an alcoholic. Brennan tells Shane to bring him in. They search his belongings at the station and find a watch that belonged to one of the bodies stolen from the morgue. Brennan tells Shane to book him on suspicion of murder.Jarrod sends Scott on an errand after he tells Jarrod Sue will be stopping by later. Sue enters the darkened Museum. Igor locks her in then follows her as she wanders around looking for Scott. She is drawn to the Joan of Arc and climbs back on the tableaux. She pulls back the black wig and finds Cathy\u0027s blond hair beneath. Jarrod tells her, \"You shouldn\u0027t have done that, my dear.\" Sue tells Jarrod, \"It\u0027s Cathy\u0027s body under the wax. I knew it. I knew it all the time.\" Jarrod gets up out of the wheelchair and walks towards her. She runs straight into Igor. She hits Jarrod about the head and his wax face breaks off revealing the scarred face below. She is taken to the basement where Jarrod fires up his wax machine.At police headquarters they are questioning Leon with alcohol as a bribe. He spills his guts and tells the police, \"The whole place is a morgue.\" The police race over to the House of Wax. Sue is shackled in a box with the hot wax shower threatening. Scott returns to the museum looking for Sue. Igor blocks the door to the workshop and he and Igor fight. Scott is knocked out. Igor places his body on the guillotine, but before he can operate the machine the police stop him. The police break down the door to the cellar. They fight with Jarrod on the bridge above the boiling vat of wax. Jarrod is knocked into the liquid and dies. Brennan moves the box Sue is shackled into away from the hot wax as the machinery explodes.The next morning Scott, Sue, Brennan and Shane meet in Brennan\u0027s office. We close with Brennan holding up the wax head of Igor.","numvotes":"17867","primarytitle":"House of Wax","productioncompany":"Bryan Foy Productions","countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"7.0","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"House of Wax","sex of artist":"male","storyline":"Professor Henry Jarrod is a true artist whose wax sculptures are lifelike.

Kathy is tricked into going on a date with Mr. Vernon, but when she overeagerly makes her move onto him in his parked car in the woods, the students appear in their cars to taunt her. Running away from several carloads of her tormentors, Kathy runs onto a busy street where she immediately gets hit by an oncoming car and is admitted to the local hospital in a coma. Kathy\u0027s strange mother, Mary, continues to gloom around the school in her capacity as a cleaner.Some time later, a new girl named Eva Gordon (Laura Naszinski), arrives at the school where she is shown around by the stern headmistress Miss Jones, and given Kathy\u0027s old room. Eva becomes acquainted with several of the perpetrators of the stunt. It is soon revealed (to the viewers only) that Eva is Kathy. Eva has somehow been processed by the spirit of the comatose Kathy whom begins using supernatural powers of telekinesis and magic to exact revenge against all those involved in the prank that put her in a coma. The first victim is Mr. Vernon, whom asks Eva on a date. That night while waiting for Eva to show up at the gym for their secret rendezvous, the narcissist Mr. Vernon is attacked and strangled by his own reflection when it jumps out of a mirror. The following morning, the police detective on the scene (director Lucio Fulci) concludes that Mr. Vernon died of a heart attack.The following night, Virginia Williams (Kathi Wise), one of the students involved in the prank against Kathy, is attacked in her bed and suffocated to death by an onslaught of snails that appear and then dissappear. Again the police do not have any explination for the mysterious death.Meanwhile, the neurologist in charge of Kathy\u0027s case, Dr. Robert Anderson (Jared Martin), notices that Kathy\u0027s vital signs increase in step with each of the mysterious deaths at the school. But he cannot make a connection to it. The next morning, Dr. Anderson is called to the school to examine Eva when she has a violent breathing fit during a class. During that same time, Kathy\u0027s respirator temporally breaks down which leads to Eva\u0027s respiratic attack, but nobody makes any connection to it. Afterwards, the strange Eva comes on strong to Dr. Anderson, leading him to ask her on a date where afterwards she seduces him.During a field trip to a local art gallery, Grace, another one of Kathy\u0027s tormenters, returns to the gallery when it closes to search for a valuable piece of jewelry that she left behind on the day visit. A marble statue comes to life and falls down on her, crushing her to death.Dr. Anderson starts to become more apprehensive about the intense Eva. One evening, he suffers a horrible nightmare where she kills him after sex. He\u0027s relieved when Eva\u0027s mother arrives at the school to take her home for some rest. Eva begins to write obsessive love notes to him, but he brushes them off. Soon, Anderson becomes involved with another girl, named Jenny Clark (Ulli Reinthaler), the only student who shows any remorse for the prank gone wrong against Kathy.Eva runs away from home and returns to the school after dark. Eva sets her eyes on Kim (Sophie D\u0027Aulan), one of Kathy\u0027s cruelest tormenters. As Kim is preparing to meet her boyfriend Tim for a date, Eva makes Kim see horrific visions of Tim being decapitated at every turn. Kim suffers an anxiety attack and in attempting to flee from the gory visions, plummets out of a third floor window to her death. Tim arrives seconds later, looks out an open window, and sees Kim lying dead on the pavement below. Tim is decapitated for real when Eva commands the window blind to fall down on his neck. Eva quietly leaves the building, while Kathy\u0027s mother, Mary, watches from a distance.At the hospital, Jenny arrives for a late-night date with Dr. Anderson, when she gets lost in the gloomily lit building, thanks to Eva using Kathy\u0027s magic skills of mind bending.

Below they are listed by their real Italian names.**Muriel Hampton Arrowsmith (Barbara Steele) has entered the lab of her husband Dr. Stephen Arrowsmith (Paul Muller) with a drink. He chastises her for entering without permission, commenting on her drinking. She acknowledges that he is leaving for a scientific conference where he will be with other fanatical good-for-nothings like yourself she taunts. He tells her not to speak to him like that. She reminds him that she is his wife and would like to spend the night with him. They kiss. Muriel notices that this has been observed by Solange (Helga Liné), who is waiting to see him off on his long journey. They say their goodbyes and he tells her he will only be a couple of days gone. The carriage is brought up by David (Rik Battaglia) who asks about the new plants. He is told to water them in the greenhouse. Dr. Arrowsmith leaves.Muriel goes to the piano and plays music. Hearing this, David drops what he is doing and heads into the house to meet her. Muriel disrobes, puts on her nightgown and perfume and begins passionate kissing with David, which progresses to the bed. She stops, suggesting they are too near Solanges room and they should go to the greenhouse. Once there, they lie down and begin passionate kissing.Outside we see Dr. Arrowsmith waiting and watching for a signal from Solange. From an upstairs window we see a light flashing back and forth. Holding his cane, he enters the greenhouse and confronts the lovers. He strikes David in the face with his cane, then his wife. Next we see both of them strung up on a wall with Stephen whipping them. He uses a heated poker on David. Next we see Stephen pouring a glass of water from a pitcher. Both look thirsty and Muriel begs for a sip. He brings it close, then pours it out. She curses him with her hatred, but then confesses that she recently remade her will, leaving all her wealth to her step-sister Jenny.Stephen is pouring through a book, presumably a law book, as he plans what he will do. Solange tells him he will have to keep her alive, but that Solange wants her share of the money that he has promised her. He reassures her that he will win and Solange will get what is coming to her. Then he says Jenny will inherit the money, but everyone knows Jenny is mad. She will be confined to a mental hospital and he will discover the cure.Next we see Muriel and David in the bedroom with Muriel chained to the bed and David chained to a chair. Stephen drips acid onto Muriel from a contraption and she cries out. David cries out as well, seeing her suffer. Stephen releases him from the chair and he rises, to be pushed onto the bed with her. Still shackled on his feet with wires connected, Stephen turns on a switch which electrocutes them both in bed. They cry out.Stephen is seen removing her heart from her corpse, which he places in a water tank along with the heart of David. Next we see her ashes placed in an urn with a strange plant.Stephen arrives at the castle with Jenny, who he has just married, having gotten her from the asylum. Solange is annoyed that he married her against their plan. He consoles Solange (who appears years younger) that once Jenny is insane enough to commit that he will be named over her estate and then Solange will get her money. In the meantime, he will see to it that Jenny goes mad.He prepares a hallucinogen to be added to Jennys drink which Solange adds. That night Jenny hears two hearts beating and gets up. She opens a door to find wind and a laughing woman\u0027s voice. Seeing the plant, which has almost bloomed, she notices drops of blood beside it. She gets back in bed with Stephen, who pretends to be asleep. Later she tells him about her dream and the blood. He tells her it is only a nightmare.Jenny and Stephen are seen at a fountain with white doves. Jenny asks questions about Muriel and Stephen fills her in. She apologizes to Stephen for her outburst last night. He tells her if could be nothing other than delirium, which he hopes will not happen again. Solange comes to tell him that the lab is ready. He goes with her, leaving Jenny at the fountain.In the lab, he finds that one vial is still present in the cabinet: the vial of hallucinogen that Jenny was supposed to have received last night. Solange apologizes and says it couldn\u0027t be. He insists otherwise, but tells her that regardless, Jenny seems to not need the drug to go over the edge. He kisses Solange.Jenny finds the sheet music on the piano and asks if Muriel wrote it. She is told that Muriel occasionally did write music. Jenny attempts to play the theme. As the music plays, she seems to become more like Muriel and asks for a drink. The servant brings it, and she remarks that she likes it. Stephen throws down a medical journal that he doesn\u0027t care for and complains about the doctor who wrote it. After the music has stopped, he notices that Jenny is gone. He and Solange go to her room, but she is not there. Then a scream is heard. Solange says that it comes from below. They head toward the passage leading down to the crypt. Another scream is heard before they reach it. At the bottom of the stairs, they push open a door to find Jenny white as a ghost, collapsing. Stephen carries her up to her bed. They discuss what happened and she cannot remember parts of it, only that her hands were bloody and she tried to remove the covering to the crypt. He tells her it was all in her imagination. She insists that the door to the crypt was locked, but he says no, it was easily opened when he pushed on it. He tells her that her condition frequently causes things to seem impossible. She begs him not send her back to the asylum and he agrees, but tells her he wants her to get better. Dr. Joyce (Marino Masé) will come and take care of her, since he did for so many years at the hospital.When Dr. Joyce arrives, he is greeted by Stephen and Jenny, who tries to sweep him away to the woods. Stephen intervenes, suggesting that the doctor has just arrived. Dr. Joyce says it is all right, but Jenny agrees that her husband is right, leaving and going inside.Dr. Joyce talks to Jenny about remembering all that has happened to her. He says Stephen has told him everything that has happened recently. She remembers something about David but gets confused. He asks what happened. She tells him that someone else takes over her mind and that then she gets confused. She remembers the crypt and the greenhouse, so they go there in an effort to remember. She says someone was kissing her, but she cant remember who. Someone else came in and struck him. She tells Dr. Joyce that she lost an earring which should be in the leaves below. When he finds it, she seems to recognize it but then when questioned further becomes confused. He suggests maybe she lost it another time. Then she admits that it is not her earring and she has never seen it before.In Dr. Arrowsmiths study, Solange breaks a bottle and he chides her, telling her he was able to restore her youth but not her mind. She reminds him that it is not her mind that he needs. Dr. Joyce comes in to discuss Jennys condition, showing him the earring that she found in the greenhouse. Stephen tells Solange to go find the other earring in Jennys room. Going to a secret location, Solange gets the other earring and goes to Jennys room (which Stephen says has changed per Dr. Joyce). She slips it into the jewel box and tells Jenny the Doctor wants to see it. When Jenny shows her jewelry to Dr. Joyce, she finds the other earring and becomes confused. Stephen brings over the other one, explaining that they are Muriels earrings and that Jenny has never worn them. Confused, she leaves the room.At dinner, Dr. Joyce is discussing wizards and witches of Africa who made contact with the dead, when suddenly Jenny rises, announcing she is tired and will turn in. Stephen tells her he will follow immediately. Jenny leaves and the doctors discuss her condition. All at once Solange cries out, having apparently cut herself. Stephen attends to her, telling Dr. Joyce he will have to take her to the lab to prevent a hemorrhage. He explains that she has a rare blood disorder but that it is nothing. As they leave the room, Dr. Joyce notices her place at the table, looking closely at it. The butler comes in and asks if he wants anything, to which he replies no. Announcing that he will go to his room, he leaves. The butler also looks at the place he was looking.Upstairs, Dr. Joyce finds his room locked and knocks, asking who is there. Behind him there is a noise and he looks around to find a passageway opening in a panel in the wall. He goes through.In the lab, Stephen tells Solange that they will need new blood. He draws some from a container and gives her an injection. He says this worked for now but soon they will need some new solution.Jenny awakens to the sound of the hearts beating. She hears Muriels voice telling her that her blood is being used down in the laboratory and to hurry. Jenny gets up and begins to go.Dr. Joyce finds himself in the crypt looking at graves. He finds Muriels crypt and the lid slides over, revealing it to be empty.Jenny enters the lab and picking up a scalpel, he goes to attack Stephen, who is attending to Solange. Solange cries out as she sees her coming. Striking his face with the scalpel, Jenny renders a cut on Stephen just as Dr. Joyce enters. He takes Jenny back to her room. Solange tells Stephen that it was not the face of Jenny but Muriel.In her room, Jenny draws Dr. Joyce to sit in bed with her. He speaks to her and she looks strangely at him, asking who he is. She tells him she is not Jenny, but Muriel and kisses him. Again he calls Jenny and she kisses him again. Suddenly the doors fly open and a breeze blows through. Seeing no one, Dr. Joyce returns to Jenny, who asks if he saw what she saw. He tells her that he will find out what it was. In the greenhouse, Jenny asks the doctor what Muriel wants with her. He tells her that she must leave these surroundings in order to get better.Solange tells Stephen that the doctor is now a threat and cannot be allowed to leave the castle. He agrees with her. At that moment Dr. Joyce enters and asks to speak to him. Solange leaves. He tells Stephen that he will take Jenny back to the clinic in the morning so she can get better. Stephen agrees and Dr. Joyce retires to his room, beginning to write. Next he calls the butler to prepare his bath. Meanwhile Stephen drills a hole in the wall in the bathroom and connects wires to electrocute Dr. Joyce when he steps into the tub. Before Joyce can do that, the butler returns with towels and fixes them on a rack by the tub. As he brushes by the tub, he accidently knocks the soap bar into the water. Hearing activity, Stephen prepares to throw the switch and does. When he reaches for the soap he cries out as he is electrocuted. Dr. Joyce removes him and next they are seen discussing his death. Joyce pronounces a heart attack and Stephen tells Solange to take Jenny away.Stephen asks Joyce to prepare a death certificate and help move his body back to his room. When that is done, Joyce wants to light a candle for the dead while Stephen leaves. After they both leave the room, the butlers hand falls to the side, revealing a burn on his wrist from the electric shock.Solange meets Stephen in the hall, confessing she is frightened and uncertain of what to do now. He reassures her everything will go as planned. He goes to speak to Jenny, telling her she has been through a shock. She says she is anxious to leave in the morning with Dr. Joyce. At this point he turns on her, accusing Dr. Joyce of manipulating her because she is weak, beautiful and rich. She swears he has done nothing wrong and that they have been friends for many years. He tells her he saw them holding hands in the greenhouse and that he doesn\u0027t want to lose her. He persuades her to come with him to Spain or Italy and she agrees.Next we see Dr. Joyce reluctantly telling Jenny that it will be good for her to go elsewhere. She acts as if he might be talking down to her. He tells her he will be leaving in the morning, but that he is very fond of her and if she ever needs anything for her to call upon him. She cries.That night she is dreaming as Muriel again and Dr. Joyce comes in and observes her as she writhes. He asks if it is Muriel and asks where her body is and who killed her. When Stephen comes into the room, he hides behind draperies. Jenny screams when she sees Stephen.Solange begs Stephen for the blood of Jenny to replenish her, saying that Muriels blood is heavy within her, like mercury. He promises that Jennys blood will be available soon.Next morning Dr. Joyce is saying goodbye when Jenny approaches and asks why he is leaving. She asks him if he likes the Hampton Crest which is at the base of a statue of two lovers. She seems more like Muriel. He bids them goodbye and leaves. Solange seems in pain waiting for the new blood.Jenny is seen in her room, packing. Thunder is heard outside. Jenny approaches Stephen and calls him. He comes toward her with a murderous look and slaps her down. Grabbing her, he tells Solange to come to the lab. Meanwhile in the rain we see Dr. Joyce who has returned and enters the castle. Inside, he looks at the Hampton Crest, finally turning it clockwise, which opens a cabinet door. Inside is the container with the two hearts of Muriel and David. He carries it to the desk and removes the dagger. The cries of Muriel and David are heard by Dr. Joyce and seen looking down from a high position.In the lab Stephen tells Jenny that her sister is calling her and that we will no longer have to deal with hearing her cries anymore. Solange cries out that she cant stand it. Stephen brings cotton dipped in ether and puts Jenny to sleep. Solange is told to lie on the other berth. After they are connected with tubes, Stephen tells Solange it will take about two hours and for her to remain still while he prepares for the trip the three of them will make.Stephen comes out and sees Muriel and David with their wounds, facing Dr. Joyce. Stephen hits Joyce from behind with a candlestick, knocking him out. Muriel takes Stephen aside, telling him she will help him see the ecstasy of pain and death that she has. As he pulls her hair aside, he sees her hideously deformed face. She laughs and secures him in the chair, throwing a candle and setting him on fire. Meanwhile David enters the lab and Solange, seeing him, screams. He cuts the blood line, laughing, and it drips on the floor. Next we see Stephens chair with his body completely burnt up. Muriel stops laughing. Solange is shown back in her old body again as David laughs, destroying the lab equipment. Next we see Solange as only a skeleton.Dr. Joyce recovers and stands up. David approaches Jenny on the table and shakes her. She awakens and screams. At this point Dr. Joyce comes in and pulls David away into the lab which is filling with smoke. He picks Jenny up and carries her out. Upstairs they lock the doors to keep David out and turn to run. Jenny is horrified to see Muriel coming toward them. David breaks the doors open and comes in. At this point Dr. Joyce takes the two hearts and throws them into the fire. As they burn, Muriel and David disappear. Dr. Joyce and Jenny run outside into the rain. As they pause and look back, he tells her she is safe now and will have no more problems from Muriel. The two hearts are shown again burning in the fireplace.","numvotes":"2404","primarytitle":"Nightmare Castle"},"color":"rgb(93,99,84)","size":1.0},{"source":"Action","target":"tt1103256","id":"6632","attributes":{"notes":"Orientalism; war as context","runtimeminutes":"89","sex of killer":"unhuman","synopsis":"From the creators of the horror cult hit, Dead Birds, comes a psychological horror film about a unit of U.S. soldiers in present-day Afghanistan who unknowingly release a vengeful supernatural force that wages upon them a deadly war.

Carol, their very young daughter, is in bed right in the next room, but she is awake. Heartbroken, Lucy suffers a moment of fury and confusion that leads her to spontaneously pick up a nearby axe and decapitate her husband and his lover while they sleep. Carol watches in terror and shock as Lucy hacks the two bodies to pieces. Lucy is declared insane and sent to an asylum, where she endures traumatic shock treatments for her mental breakdown.The narrator of the flashback is revealed to be Carol, now a young woman. It is twenty years later, and Carol is opening up about her past to her boyfriend, Michael Fields. After Lucy\u0027s incarceration, Carol was taken in by her aunt and uncle, Bill and Emily, and the family lives on a farm in a rural location. Carol is revealing the family history to Michael because Lucy is being released from the asylum, and is coming to live with the family. When Lucy arrives, she is skittish. She cautiously acclimates to the farm, exploring the area with Carol and meeting the gritty-looking farm hand, Krause. But she is clearly thrilled to see Carol again, and is touched by the lovely young woman Carol has become. Carol is a sculptress and has a spacious studio filled with her work, and she thrills Lucy by giving her a bust of herself just as she was in her youth.Things quickly start to get strange. Carol shocks Lucy by presenting her with two bracelets she used to wear when she was a young woman, large dangling charm bracelets that jangle when she walks. Carol seems intent on recreating Lucy as a young woman, taking her clothes shopping and buying her a wig that mimics the hairstyle she wore the last time Carol saw her. Lucy is uncomfortable with this, but agrees to dress this way to please her daughter, whom she desperately wants to make amends with. While they are in the wig shop, Lucy hears strange voices, as if children are singing a morbid nursery rhyme about her crimes. She dismisses it as nerves. Later, she suffers a terrible nightmare and wakes up to discover two bloody heads in bed with her, with a bloody axe lying nearby. When she wakes the others, the items are gone from her room. Lucy starts to think she is relapsing.Things get worse when Carol attempts to introduce Michael to her mother. When Michael stops by for drinks, Lucy seems to try and seduce him, all with Carol right there in the room. The embarassing scene is interrupted by Lucy\u0027s former psychiatrist, Dr. Anderson, who makes an unexpected visit. When he sees how unstable Lucy seems, Dr. Anderson makes comments to the family that suggest he would like to take Lucy back to the hospital. When the doctor gets Lucy alone, his comments upset her and she runs off. As Dr. Anderson searches for her around the farm, he enters the darkened barn and a shadowy figure corners him--it appears to be Lucy, the silhouette revealing her hairstyle and figure, right down to the jangling bracelets she wears. The figure is holding an axe, and quickly decapitates Dr. Anderson.Carol returns to the farmhouse to find her mother alone in the darkened living room. The doctor\u0027s car is still outside, and Carol quickly comes to the conclusion that her mother has killed him. In a panic, Carol drives the doctor\u0027s car into a barn and locks it in, but she is spotted by Krause, who is lurking the shadows. The next day, Carol sees Krause painting the car a different color and angrily confronts him, but he smugly suggests that he knows what happened to the doctor, and that he\u0027ll turn Lucy in to the authorities if Carol fires him. Lucy overhears the conversation from the window. Later that evening, Krause is stalked and murdered with the axe.Lucy prepares for an evening that she dreads, a dinner party intended to introduce her to Michael\u0027s parents. If Michael and Carol are to be married, these will be their in-laws, and Michael\u0027s family is very wealthy, his father being the proprietor of a very successful dairy farm. Lucy has a panic attack in the powder room while at the Fields\u0027--after spilling coffee on her dress, she retreats to the washroom and suffers a flashback because of the wallpaper, which resembles the bars of a prison cell. Carol calms her down and takes her back to the party. Mr. \u0026 Mrs. Fields are cordial until they plot to get Lucy alone so they can have a private conversation with her: Mrs. Fields is suspicious of Lucy, and poor Lucy makes a terrible misstep by revealing to Mr. \u0026 Mrs. Fields that her daughter and Michael are planning to be married. The Fields had not been informed of this yet, and they react disapprovingly. Mrs. Fields in particular gets very haughty with Lucy, making suggestions about her past, and Lucy suddenly snaps at her, revealing that she was in an asylum for twenty years. She says that under no circumstances will she allow the Fields\u0027 to interfere with her daughter\u0027s happiness, and she storms out of the house.Michael drives Emily and Carol back to their house while he and Bill go out looking for Lucy, who has disappeared. Emily sends Carol to bed, but Carol is restless and cannot sleep. With Michael gone from the Fields\u0027 house, Mr. and Mrs. Fields are alone in their house and they hear sounds to suggest someone is prowling around. Mr. Fields is oblivious, but when he goes into his closet to get undressed for the evening, he is attacked by the figure of Lucy, brandishing an axe. Mrs. Fields becomes suspicious and goes looking for her husband, eventually finding his body in the dressing room. Horrified, she retreats, only to be confronted by the figure of Lucy in the bedroom. Before the axe can fall, the bedroom door opens and the real Lucy comes in; after scuffling with the other figure, Lucy tears off a mask to reveal her daughter\u0027s face underneath. Carol has been committing the murders while dressing as her mother; scarred by witnessing the double homicide committed by her mother, Carol\u0027s mind was unstable ever since. Certain that Mr. and Mrs. Fields would never allow Michael to marry her without a great deal of trouble, she plotted to make it appear as if Lucy murdered them in a rage, which would send Lucy back to the asylum and allow her to marry Michael. Her mind shattered, Carol clutches the mask of her mother and screams at it \"I hate you! I hate you! Oh I\u0027m sorry, I love you! I hate you! I love you!\" Outside on the porch, Lucy hears her daughter\u0027s insane ravings and weeps, perhaps remembering her own moment of insanity.An epilogue reveals Lucy discussing her plans with Bill. With Carol now committed to an asylum just as she once was, Lucy intends to stand by her daughter and be whatever kind of support that she needs.","numvotes":"5667","primarytitle":"Strait-Jacket","productioncompany":"William Castle Productions","countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"6.8","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"Strait-Jacket","sex of artist":"female","storyline":"Lucy Harbin has been in an asylum for twenty years after axing her husband and his mistress during a crime of passion, witnessed by her young daughter, Carol.

On his way through the village of Oakdale, the Bat notices someone robbing the Oakdale bank. Intrigued, the Bat follows the robber, who leads him to the old Fleming mansion.Inside the Fleming mansion, Cornelia van Gorder [Grayce Hamptom] and her ditzy maid Lizzie Allen [Maude Eburne] are discussing Cornelia\u0027s decision to rent the house for the summer. The big old house is a scary place, and Lizzie doesn\u0027t like the strange sounds, the strange caretaker [Spencer Charters], and the strange stories he tells about seeing ghosts in the house. Add to the fact that the Bat has taken to the country, and Lizzie is terrified of everything and anything. She\u0027s even gone so far as to set a bear trap outside her bedroom window, just in case the Bat decides to pay a vist. When Cornelia\u0027s niece Dale [Una Merkel], who works at the Oakdale Bank, returns home with her boyfriend Brook Bailey[William Bakewell] and tries to pass him off as a gardener, Cornelia is immediately suspicious (Cornelia: Any experience with alopecias? Brook: They dry up if you don\u0027t water them.), but Cornelia hires him anyway, at least until she can find out why Dale has brought him home.A rock suddenly comes crashing through the window. A note on it reads: Get out of the house now while there is still time. Immediately thereafter, Dr Venrees [Gustav von Seyffertitz] drops by to inform Cornelia that the Oakdale bank has been robbed of a half million dollars and that Fleming, Sr, the owner of the mansion, is returning from Europe so Cornelia will have to vacate the house. Then, a heavy painting moves, and a voice from behind warns them to get out of the house. Becoming concerned, Cornelia phones the police. When Detective Anderson [Chester Morris] shows up, Cornelia explains her suspicion that Fleming, Jr [Hugh Huntley] is trying to frighten her out of the house, possibly because he rented it to her while his father was out of the country. Nowthat his father is returning, she thinks he may be trying to frighten her into leaving.Soon everyone begins acting suspiciously. The doctor unlocks the broken window and \"forgets\" to relock it until Cornelia relocks it herself. Alone in the parlor for a few moments, Venrees unlocks the window again. Brook starts going around the house pounding on the walls. Dale phones Fleming Jr and asks him to come over. When he does, he brings a blueprint of the house so that they can locate a hidden room. Before they can find it, he is murdered, and Dale hides a piece torn from the blueprint under a tray. A storm is approaching, and the lightning knocks out the electricity. Someone phones from the garage, but when Det Anderson goes out to check, there is no one there. Detective Jones [Charles Dow Clark] arrives to help with the investigation. Dr Venrees finds the torn piece from the blueprint showing that the hidden room is behind a fireplace, but Det Anderson forces him to hand it over. When Anderson is poring over the blueprint, Venrees clobbers him with a heavy statue and locks his body in a closet. In the lightning flashes, the silhouette of the Bat can be seen peering into the window.It gets even more intriguing. Brook turns out to be a cashier from the bank and the primary suspect in the theft. Fleming Sr is seen walking on the roof when he\u0027s supposed to be out of the country. Dale finds the secret room behind a fireplace and gets locked in, along with the Bat, Mr Fleming Sr, and the money. The Bat shoots Fleming Sr. Dale escapes and leads Inspector Jones, Cornelia, and Dr Venrees to the secret room. Just as the fireplace swings open, Venrees blows out the candle, allowing whomever was in the room to escape. Finally, Inspector Anderson figures it out. Dr Venrees and Fleming Sr robbed the bank together and hid the money in the house. Anderson arrests Venrees and locks him in a closet.A strange man suddenly stumbles into the room. He\u0027s been hit in the head and is suffering from amnesia. He remembers only that he tried to phone from the garage. As they search the secret room for the money and find nothing, Cornelia thinks that she sees someone out on the roof and Anderson goes outside to catch him. Shortly thereafter, the garage is set afire. The amnesic man grabs a gun and orders everyone to be silent. The fire was set to get everyone out of the room, he explains, and the person who set that fire will be back shortly to get the money. They blow out the candles and wait. The Bat enters the house. The amnesic man points the gun at the Bat and orders Inspector Jones to disarm him. Just as they prepare to remove the black hood from the Bat\u0027s face, the Bat creates a distraction by knocking over a chair and escaping...right into the bear trap that Lizzie set so many hours ago.The Bat has been captured. They remove his hood to see that it\u0027s Detective Anderson. The amnesic explains that he is the real Detective Anderson, but he was clobbered in the garage by the Bat, who took his IDs. But the Bat isn\u0027t ready to be captured. While he extols his great intellect, he pulls out a gun he found on the ground and forces everyone to put up their hands. Only Cornelia refuses. I took the bullets out of that gun only ten minutes ago, she says. Everyone jumps on the Bat, and the gun goes off. Cornelia was lying!As the movie closes and the curtain falls on the stage, the Bat drops down from the ceiling. Chester Morris, who played Detective Anderson and the Bat, then addresses the audience. He asks them not to reveal the identity of the Bat to anyone and promises that, if they keep the secret, the Bat will not haunt their homes, steal their money, or frighten their children.

As part of the ritual they chop her hand off, take it outside and throw it to the jackals. They go back into tomb and place the lid on the sarcophagus. Outside, a jackal dies on the ground with its throat ripped and bloody as the hand crawls away. As the priests leave the tomb a sandstorm appears and they all die with lacerated throats too. The severed hand crawls away. Margaret awakes from her nightmare. Her father Professor Julian Fuchs (Andrew Weir) comes into bedroom to comfort her. Another man, Corbeck (James Villiers), watches then from the window of an empty house opposite.Next morning the Professor gives Margaret a ring containing a large ruby. She puts it on showing she has a scar completely across her wrist before going off with her boyfriend Tod (Mark Edwards) in his sports car, observed again from by Corbeck from opposite.In a mental hospital two orderlies look at Berrigan (George Coulouris) in his cell which has a desk and some furnishings. He is seeing some lights that look like stars on his carpet.Tod inspects Margaret\u0027s ring closely. He thinks it must have come from her father\u0027s expedition. Tod says he will take it to a friend who can give them more information.At the mental hospital, Corbeck visits Berrigan. He tries to take an ornamental cobra from the wardrobe but Berrigan attacks him and the orderlies intervene and make him leave.Tod and Margaret visit expert Geoffrey Dandridge (Hugh Burden) to show him the ring but when he sees Margaret he collapses. Star-like lights appear in the ring.Fortune teller Helen Dickerson (Rosalie Crutchley) is looking into her crystal ball to read a fortune for her customer but sees the same star-like lights too. She is alarmed and asks the customer to leave.Later, at the end of the day, Geoffrey sends his assistant home then goes to a cupboard and takes out and opens a box containing a jackal\u0027s skull. Corbeck arrives and Geoffrey explains that he has seen a woman with the ring. Corbeck explains to Geoffrey she is Margaret Fuchs, daughter of Professor Fuchs, and it will soon be her birthday and soon be time.That night Margaret dreams again about the soul of Queen Tera living all these years while her mortal body has waited. Her time is drawing near and it was she who guided people to her tomb to find her. In a flashback, explorers Professor Fuchs, Geoffrey, Corbeck, Berrigan and Helen Dickerson enter Queen Tera\u0027s tomb. Around the tomb are several ornaments around including one of a cobra snake, the skull of jackal, and a cat. They open the sarcophagus and see Queen Tera\u0027s body with the hand severed. The hand is on the floor next to the sarcophagus with the red ruby ring on a finger. The Professor takes the ring off and from its inscriptions identifies the queen as Tera. At the exact same time, Mrs Fuchs is in hospital giving birth to baby but she dies in the process. The baby at first appears to be stillborn but then doctors hear its heart start beating. The severed arm of Queen Tera in the sarcophagus starts bleeding fresh blood. Margaret wakes up from her dream and tells Tod she must leave immediately.In the basement of his house Professor Fuchs opens the sarcophagus and looks at Queen Tera\u0027s body. Margaret and Tod arrive, observed by Corbeck opposite, but there is an ominous feeling and sound from the basement. They break down the door to the basement and rush to the Professor who has cuts on his neck. He instructs them to call Doctor Putnum (Aubrey Morris). They put the Professor in bed but he is unresponsive. Doctor Putnum says the Professor will be like that for a few days and cannot reveal much about Professor\u0027s wishes other than his work would astound the world of science.That night Margaret goes to the basement and looks at Queen Tera\u0027s body. Corbeck arrives and explains the ruby is the symbol of the god to come. The Professor life\u0027s work was to discover the legend of the queen and find the truth, and he and Corbeck and their team searched for her tomb together. There was an attack on one of their members in tomb and fresh blood from Tera\u0027s wrist at exactly the same time Margaret was born in the image of Tera. Tod arrives and they agree Tera has some kind of astral power which will be directed against them if they don\u0027t understand it. They agree they must contact all old members of team to help reunite Tera with her soul.Tod and Margaret visit Berrigan at the mental hospital. When he sees Margaret he is frightened. Margaret realises he thinks she is Tera so she pretends to be Tera and asks for her familiar - her snake. He says he has not got it, then breaks down causing the orderlies to enter and restrain him and Tod and Margaret have to leave.Back home, Putnum is checking on the Professor. He is still unconscious and the doctor says there will be some paralysis on one side. He says the Professor wanted to protect her from the artefacts in the basement.Tod reads the Professor\u0027s journal. The simultaneous events of the Professor entering the tomb and Margaret\u0027s birth were a unity created by Tera. Tera had prepared for an abstract metaphysical state by lying in her sarcophagus, creating an astral body with freewill and a conscious intelligence. He believes this power could be used to keep people alive for a long time in suspended animation. Margaret says she feels Tera is dreaming of loneliness, of ancient land and times, when love was a divine possession.In the mental hospital that night the orderlies tease Berrigan with the cobra then leave it on the desk where he can see it when they leave. He struggles in his strait-jacket then goes still and listens. Suddenly the snake disappears from the desk and he sees its shadow approaching him. The window bursts open and wind blows everything around but he cannot escape. The snake approaches and strikes him. He dies with his cuts to his throat.The next morning the Professor wakes up. Margaret explains he had a terrible shock. She asks about the ring and why would it protect her. The Professor explains the priest severed it because they thought it was source of her evil. She says Berrigan is dead and the snake has appeared in their basement. She mentions Corbeck but the Professor implores her not to have anything to do with him. She asks where Tera\u0027s hand is but he cannot answer. Out of the window she sees Corbeck going into house opposite and she goes across to confront him. They argue over the facts but she says they need her and she is interested in the power that she may now have. Corbeck says Tera is beyond good and evil and they need to understand her. He says the relics from her tomb are needed for her resurrection from the dead, to provide power over life and death. He says her father is weak and cannot be a part of it. She says she will do anything to have the power so Corbeck says they will do it together.At Geoffrey\u0027s, his assistant tells him about Berrigan\u0027s death as she leaves at the end of the day. He realises that the jackal skull is significant and takes it out. Margaret arrives and says she wants the skull. He panics and tries to escape out of the window and down the fire escape but he drops the box. As he looks for it he hears a jackal call. He flees in fright.Tod arrives wondering what is going on. Margaret will not tell him anything and leaves. He looks around and hears the jackal call from outside. He investigates, going down the fire escape where he finds the empty box that housed the skull. Hearing noises then a scream he finds Geoffrey\u0027s body with the throat lacerated and bloody. He sees the shadow of a jackal running away.Margaret looks at Tera\u0027s body in the sarcophagus. The wrist is still bleeding fresh blood. Corbeck arrives and together they see that both the cobra and the jackal\u0027s skull are now present in the basement. Tod arrives and tries to stop Corbeck and Margaret. When they refuse he drives away to get help. Margaret screams wishing Tod dead. Tod crashes his car into a tree, his throat lacerated and covered in blood. She is frightened but Corbeck says she must not weaken and she is coming of age. Margaret collapses to the floor.The Professor staggers down to the basement and sees Margaret lying on the floor. Corbeck explains that Margaret no longer exists and soon Tera will be reborn and the Professor cannot do anything to stop it. Corbeck leaves to get the final artefact, the third and final phase of Tera\u0027s soul.Margaret dreams in bed watched by the Professor and Doctor Putnam. The Professor insists Putnum give her an injection to ensure she will not wake but while he is preparing it she wakes up. He tries to convince her to go back to bed but she uses her willpower to kill him. He dies with a lacerated throat like the others and Margaret flees. The Professor returns to find Putnum\u0027s body, then Corbeck arrives and helps the Professor move the body downstairs. Corbeck says they need each other and they control Tera not the other way around. Corbeck knows where Margaret has gone.Margaret arrives at Helen Dickerson\u0027s house. She is afraid and tries to strike Margaret but cannot do so. Instead she concedes and gives Margaret the statue of the cat. As Margaret leaves, she uses her willpower again to kill Helen. Corbeck arrives and sees Helen\u0027s body. Margaret reappears at the door and tells Corbeck to come.The Professor finds the scroll of life in the basement then sees that the statue of the cat has appeared. He looks at the severed hand in its box, then Margaret and Corbeck arrive. Corbeck takes the severed hand and places it back in the sarcophagus next to the wrist. The Professor implores him not to read the scroll saying Tera has abused her power and to wait, but Margaret says she is ready and where there is good there must be the opposite. Corbeck reads the scroll of life, to reunite Tera\u0027s soul and body and rekindle her astral spirit. The hand reattaches itself to the wrist. Margaret says to the Professor it was Tera that lead them to the tomb. The Professor realises Tera is in Margaret and Corbeck must not finish scroll. They stab Corbeck to death with some relics but Tera awakes. They try to kill her too but she kills the Professor first. Margaret manages to stab her but the building collapses in on top of them all.In a hospital, the medical staff have no idea who the woman all bandaged in the bed is.

Her daughter Clare (Raegan Revord) goes to ride her bicycle with her dog Max. Johanna goes into the house looking spaced. When Clare comes home, she goes into the attic to find Johanna hanging herself.Teenage Clare (now played by Joey King) wakes up from this nightmare. She gets ready to go to school. Clare rides her bike to school and sees her Uncle August (Victor Sutton), whom her father won\u0027t let her speak to for some reason. Clare is distracted and nearly gets struck by popular girl Darcie Chapman (Josephine Langford). Clare just scrapes her knee and rips her legging.When Clare gets to school, she sees her father Jonathan (Ryan Phillipe) dumpster-diving with his friend Carl (Kevin Hanchard). Embarrassed, she goes to tell him to go away. Clare then joins her friends June Acosta (Shannon Purser) and Meredith McNeil (Sydney Park) while we see that Clare has a crush on popular guy Paul Middlebrook (Mitchell Slaggart). Darcie also takes an opportunity to be a bitch and hit Clare with her drink.Back home, Clare returns to see her dad has found a large music box. Clare takes it inside and reads that the box will grant seven wishes. She scoffs it off.The next day, Clare is at school with June and Meredith when they are giggling as Darcie and her clique of mean girls walk by. Darcie questions Clare as to why she\u0027s laughing, and Clare says that she called Darcie \"ultimate smegma\", which is some kind of genital secretion in both males and females. Darcie smacks Clare, who smacks her back. Clare then gets knocked over, and she retaliates by tackling Darcie to the ground and engaging in a girl fight.When Clare goes home, she takes the music box and makes what she thinks is a hypothetical wish for Darcie to \"go rot\".The following morning, after an apparently crazy party in her home, Darcie wakes up to find part of her hands, feet, and face looking grotesquely rotted. The news spreads around the school that Darcie got necrotizing facilities from a spa, and that means Clare\u0027s wish has come true. However, the next morning, Clare goes to look for Max and finds his dead body under the deck in the house. She and Jonathan bury their dog.After spending a good part of her day pining for Paul, Clare decides to make her second wish be that Paul would fall madly in love with her. When she goes to school again, Paul approaches her and shows clear interest, even in front of his girlfriend Lola Sanchez (Daniela Barbosa).In Uncle August\u0027s home, the old man is preparing to take a bath. He fills his tub with water and steps in, only to clumsily slip and hit his head on the side of the tub. He regains consciousness, only to bang his head on the nozzle and die.Upon learning of August\u0027s death, Clare wonders to her father if August left his inheritance to anyone. Jonathan doubts he or Clare would have been mentioned. Considering that they aren\u0027t very financially stable at the moment, Clare goes to her room and tells the music box her third wish, which is that August had left her everything.Clare wakes up the next day to Jonathan telling her that August apparently left Clare his entire inheritance. Soon, the two move into a mansion and start driving flashy cars. Jonathan gives Clare his credit card so that she can treat June and Meredith to a shopping spree.Paul officially breaks up with Lola and immediately proceeds to ask Clare out. She takes some time to think about it.The Shannons\u0027 former neighbor Mrs. Deluca (Sherilyn Fenn) is in her home cooking dinner. She drops something down the garbage disposal and sticks her hand in there while precariously leaning close to the switch. Meanwhile, her pots on the stove appear to be burning. Mrs. Deluca pulls her hand out and turns off the stove. She then moves back toward the sink. Her ponytail goes down the disposal and she accidentally turns it on, causing the disposal to yank her hair and break her neck.Clare is still annoyed that her dad goes dumpster-diving for knick-knacks. She uses her fourth wish for Jonathan to be less embarrassing. Jonathan then becomes a smooth saxophone player that even Clare\u0027s friends find hot.Clare asks her friend Ryan Hui (Ki Hong Lee) for help in figuring out the phrase on the music box, as well as its history. They visit his cousin Gina (Alice Lee) in her loft. They find that the box has been passed down for decades, but they cannot translate the phrase. Gina sends the phrase to someone for an answer.That night, Gina is alone in her loft when she receives an email with the translation. She says it\u0027s messed up and it starts to freak her out. She tries to call Ryan outside but he doesn\u0027t answer the phone. The door behind her slams and causes her to drop her phone. She goes back inside as the power is out. In the darkness, she trips and falls face-first onto a the horn of a bull statue.At school, Clare is now Paul\u0027s girlfriend, but all of his friends don\u0027t care to hang out with her since Paul dumped Lola for her. Clare then wishes that she would become the most popular girl in school. She then gets invited to a party with Paul where they have a good time and go to his car to hook up, only for Clare to realize Paul is talking to other girls behind her back, as well as spying on her and taking pictures. She leaves Paul.Ryan finds Gina\u0027s phone on the ground and runs up to her loft to find her dead. He finds Clare at school and tells her that he learned the phrase on the box translates to \"When the music ends, the blood price is paid.\" He tells Clare that Gina is dead. Ryan also tells Clare that he\u0027s learned more about the box\u0027s history. Those who have used it all ended up dead. He refers to a man (Jerry O\u0027Connell) who used the box\u0027s wishes to make his life better, only for his wife and children to perish. He burned his house down with himself and the box inside, but the box survived. Clare and Ryan do what they can to destroy the box themselves (burning it, hitting it with sledgehammers, etc), but nothing works.Clare goes to Mrs. Deluca\u0027s home and enters to a horrible smell. She then finds Mrs. Deluca\u0027s dead body still lingering by the sink.Clare tells June and Meredith about the box and how she\u0027s been making wishes. Meredith chides her for not using wishes on good things instead of using them on herself. June encourages Clare to get rid of the box. Clare goes to do so, but then decides to keep the box just in case.While Clare is sleeping at night, she finds Paul has broken into her room. He asks her if it\u0027s over between them. Clare makes it obvious that it is, and he slits his wrist. He is later taken to the hospital.The girls hang out at a hotel. Clare gets a phone call from Jonathan saying he\u0027s going to a gig, and he soon gets a flat tire. The scene jumps between Jonathan changing his tire and Meredith going off by herself to play a phone app. Clare admits to June that she didn\u0027t get rid of the box. Meredith then sets foot in an elevator to rejoin her friends. Jonathan is nearly struck by two drag racers. He goes under the car to grab a missing piece, with the car jack nearly loosening itself. Finally, he knocks the spare tire loose, which gets hit by an oncoming car and nearly tears Jonathan\u0027s head off. The elevator that Meredith is on then malfunctions before dropping completely and crashing to the bottom, killing Meredith. June blames Clare for this.Clare struggles with the result of her wishes and the thought of undoing them. Eventually, the wishes are undone when Clare and Jonathan have their money taken because Uncle August never paid his taxes. They move back into their old home. Darcie returns to school with her skin healing and she\u0027s still a bitch to Clare. Clare finds out that June took the box from her room to try and get rid of it but Clare takes it back.Utterly frustrated and losing her mind, Clare tries to resist making another wish, but she makes her sixth wish be that her mother never committed suicide. Seconds later, she hears Johanna\u0027s voice. Clare embraces her mother for the first time in years. It also turns out that in this new time line, Clare has younger twin sisters. The happiness is short-lived Clare sees Jonathan outside under a tree as Carl is trying to chop off a branch with a chainsaw. Clare runs outside to warn her dad, only for Carl\u0027s ladder to wobble, causing him to accidentally swing the chainsaw down and decapitate Jonathan. Clare runs up to the attic and among her mom\u0027s paintings, she finds one of the same box, leading her to realize her mom once had the same box and it was responsible for her suicide. Clare screams at the box that she wants to use her last wish to go back to the day that her dad found the box.Clare wakes up on that fateful day. Max is on her bed. She calls Meredith to hear her voice, though she\u0027s annoyed that Clare woke her up. Clare asks Jonathan if she can join him and Carl as they go looking for things. Clare finds the box in a bin and wraps it in a sheet, taking it with her. Before going to school, she tells her dad she loves him.Clare finds Ryan and gives him the box, saying how she knows Gina and that she can figure out what the box says and that they should get rid of it. She also makes dinner plans with Ryan and kisses him in front of June and Meredith. Clare walks off happily... and then Darcie accidentally hits her with her car, sending Clare\u0027s body flying several feet and crashing onto a windshield. All the students look on in horror as Clare lays dead on the windshield of the other car.In the after credit scene, Ryan is seen finishing digging up a hole to bury the box. Then he looks around and takes out the box from the bag in which Clare handed it over to him saying never to open to see what\u0027s inside and to bury it so nobody could find it. He removes the dirt around the box and reads the Chinese letters and says, \"Seven wishes\" and looks around with a mischievous smile on his face.","numvotes":"20262","primarytitle":"Wish Upon"},"color":"rgb(92,73,83)","size":1.0},{"source":"struggling artist","target":"tt0433969","id":"6919","attributes":{"runtimeminutes":"78","sex of killer":"male","numvotes":"287","primarytitle":"Dead Doll","productioncompany":"Shot LLC","countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"4.0","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"Dead Doll","sex of artist":"male","storyline":"Some feelings never die.

He steps forward and observes a white statue of the Virgin Mary, with two streams of red tears flowing out of its eyes. As another priest greets him, you learn that the man is Father Andrew Kiernan, an investigator sent from the Vatican to determine the validity of divine occurrences. The priest explains to Father Kiernan that the tears began flowing when Father Almedia died; his body still on display in a coffin to the side of the statue. While Father Kiernan takes pictures and samples of the liquid, a small young boy steals the rosary wrapped around Father Almedia\u0027s hands in the coffin.In a local market, the boy sells the rosary to an older white woman, while a local stall vendor warns them that it isn\u0027t right to steal from the dead.In Pittsburg, Frankie Paige (Patricia Arquette) lives a fast and free lifestyle, working at a hair salon and partying with her friends at clubs. After a long night of partying, she wakes up to a phone call from her mother. Her mom was the lady at the Brazilian market, and had sent Frankie a package of trinkets and gifts from her travels - the rosary among the presents. Frankie gives the gifts a cursory look, and stares at the rosary after she hangs up the phone. While examining the rosary, she suddenly feels extremely nauseous and vomits.Meeting up with her friend before they head to work, they both consider the possibility that Frankie is pregnant. After a day at the salon, Frankie relaxes at home in a hot bath. Suddenly, a dove flies frantically around her apartment, and Frankie is suddenly thrown under the water in the bath, struggling with an unseen force. Flashes between nails being driving into a man\u0027s wrist, and wounds developing on Frankie\u0027s fill the screen.Her friend finds her at home in the bath with blood everywhere, and rushes her to the hospital. While a surgeon attempts to sew up the two wounds, she explains that they look like they were done by a single sharp object driven through her wrists. The staff believes they are self-inflicted, though Frankie denies it.Back in Rome, Father Kiernan comes back to give in his report about a Virgin Mary sighting in a wall in Brazil. He mentions the statue that he discovered, but is quickly directed to drop the subject by the head priest. Frustrated, the Father accepts the church\u0027s decision.Frankie and her friend are riding the subway home, when Frankie suddenly stands up from her seat to confront a priest at the end of the car. She asks the man if he is Andrew, and when he replies no, she swears, and suddenly the train runs wild. Passengers are thrown around the car, while Frankie is now being whipped on the back by an unseen force. Finding herself again at the hospital enduring rigorous tests, the doctors finally conclude that she may have a case of epilepsy. While leaving the hospital, the priest from the subway meets her in the waiting room, hands her his card, and says that when she is up to talking to him, he wants to ask her about \"stigmata.\"News of Frankie\u0027s \"attacks\" have made the papers, and the Vatican has decided to send Father Andrew Kiernan to Pittsburg, and investigate the occurrences. He is told to quiet the situation, and defuse any rumors of stigmata. Upon arrival, there is an instant connection between himself and Frankie. They have a coffee at the diner, while Father Andrew starts the interview. After Frankie explains that she isn\u0027t religious, and doesn\u0027t even believe in God, Father Andrew explains that what is happening cannot be stigmata, as it only afflicts the extremely devout. After showing the wounds on her wrist that still haven\u0027t healed, he looks confused, but still does not relent. Frankie storms out, frustrated that this glimmer of explanation and hope did not amount to anything.That night, Frankie meets her friend at their usual club. She is clearly distressed - feeling that God is doing this to her, and that she just wants everything to stop. After her friend tells her that she is losing it, Frankie storms off only to be halted by another attack - this time scratches and slashes on her forehead. Bloody and hurt, she runs from the club in the rain. She reaches her apartment door, and sees Father Andrew ringing her bell. He sees her, but Frankie runs. Father Andrew discovers her crouching on a car in an alleyway, scratching symbols into the paint with a broken bottle. He walks towards her, and Frankie stands up bellowing something in a foreign language in a man\u0027s voice. She collapses, and Father Andrew carries her into her apartment. Father Andrew calls his friend in Rome and replays the phrase Frankie yelled - the friend explains that it is an ancient dialect of Aramaic - the language of Jesus.","numvotes":"67832","primarytitle":"Stigmata"},"color":"rgb(93,99,84)","size":1.0},{"source":"special connection","target":"tt0462326","id":"6659","attributes":{"productioncompany":"Lia Scott Price Productions Inc.","countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"4.2","titletype":"movie","notes":"Adaptation","originaltitle":"The Guardian","storyline":"Adapted from Lia Scott Price\u0027s Horror Novel \"The Guardian\", a Serial Killer Guardian Angel is invoked by college students praying to a cursed Guardian Angel Statue.","startyear":"2006","runtimeminutes":"90","sex of killer":"unhuman","numvotes":"26","primarytitle":"The Guardian"},"color":"rgb(93,99,84)","size":2.0},{"source":"Short","target":"tt3609388","id":"6610","attributes":{"countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"6.1","titletype":"short","originaltitle":"The Clown Statue","sex of artist":"male","storyline":"Based on the terrifying urban legend.

In the morning, Sam is permitted to leave, but Morosini takes his passport because he considers Sam an important witness and must not leave Italy.

There, Morosini returns Sam\u0027s passport. By now, Sam has decided to stay and investigate the killings by himself.

Soon after, another man arrives at Sam\u0027s apartment and after he is given money, says he will contact Sam later to find out the idenity of the yellow jacket man who chased him. Then, the killer phones Sam and Julia at their apartment and threatens to kill them. The killer also phones the police station and taunts Morosini with planing to do more killings.

Sam\u0027s friend Carlo hears the background noise and says that it sounds familiar. He takes the tape to listen some more. Meanwhile, the killer strikes again and kills another woman, named Tina, who returns to her apartment after an outing with her boyfriend.When Sam and Julia agree that things have gone too far for them, they make plans to return to America. But the next flight will not be until two days from now. Sam decides to visit the painter of the eerie painting, who lives in a run-down house on the outskirts of Rome. The eccentric artist tells Sam that he witnesses the event of the assault on the girl from over 10 years ago. Back in Rome, Julia is alone in Sam\u0027s apartment when the unseen killer pays her a threatening visit. Sam returns just in time, and Julia is saved, but the killer has already fled yet again.The next day, Carlo arrives where he tells them that he has finally identified the background noise on the tape which is the sound of a rare bird that can only live in Northern Siberia, and the only one that resides in Rome is in the local zoo. Sam and the police arrive at the zoo and realize that it is near the apartment of Alberto and Monica. When they burst into the apartment, the couple are struggling over a knife. When the police intervene, Alberto flees and falls out a window to his death on the street below. As he is dying after the fall, he admits to being the murderer.With the case apparently wraped up, Sam cannot find Julia who had run out of Alberto\u0027s apartment with Carlo and Monica. When Sam tracks them down to a small apartment a few blocks away (the same apartment the killer resides in), he finds Carlo dead and a bound and gagged Julia on the floor. Sam turns around and sees a snickering and wild-eyed Monica holding a knife. At this point, Sam finally remembers what he saw that night: it was not Monica being attacked but it was her husband Alberto trying to stop an attack on HIM! Sam chases Monica through the dark hallways and it leads right back to the art gallery where it all started. Monica drops a heavy sculpture down on Sam, pinning him to the floor. Before she can utilize her knife, the police arrive and subdue Monica.It is revealed by Inspector Morosini that Monica was a victim of a sexual assault and lived with the trauma of it for many years. In a transference-of-guilt, Monica imposed upon herself as the assailent and killed all those women as a way of re-enacting the assault on her and her loyal husband Alberto covered up for her and was the one trying to kill Sam to prevent him from finding out of his wife\u0027s murderous activities.

As butchered bodies are heaped upon the Altar of Ishtar, Fuad slowly slips further into madness, until he is no more than the goddess\u0027s puppet; and she thirsts for the blood of Fuad\u0027s wife and daughter too. —Philip Lilienschwarz","startyear":"2016","runtimeminutes":"90","sex of killer":"male","numvotes":"1365","primarytitle":"Blood Feast"},"color":"rgb(93,99,84)","size":2.0},{"source":"Fantasy","target":"tt0056576","id":"6758","attributes":{"notes":"Mad scientist elements","runtimeminutes":"87","synopsis":"Middle-aged divorcee Simon Wells (Macdonald Carey) is on a boating holiday in the town of Weymouth on the south coast of England. There he meets Joan (Shirley Anne Field), a 20-year-old girl, who lures him into a mugging staged by her biker brother King (Oliver Reed) and his gang. Wells is beaten up and robbed.Later Joan approaches Wells on his small boat. He is prepared to forgive and forget, she implies that he asked for it after trying to pick her up. At that moment they are threatened by King and his gang. Wells sets off on his boat and calls on Joan to join him which she does, defying her over-protective (and rather incestious) brother.After drifting out to sea, Joan decides to go back and confront King, who has previously locked her into a cupboard when she has come close to other men. King and his gang keep a watch-out for them.At night Wells and Joan return to a quiet part of the mainland and make love in a cliff top house surrounded by curious sculptures. Caught up and surrounded by the gang, the couple escape into a nearby military base where guards and dogs are soon in pursuit of them all.The house was rented by sculptress Freya Neilson (Viveca Lindfors) whose lover, Bernard (Alexander Knox), is a scientist who runs the base. He will not discuss his work, warning her that he \"might be condemning her to death\".Wells and Joan make their way down the cliff face. King goes after them. There they discover a network of caves and bunkers occupied by a small group of young boys and girls, aged about 11. Although well-dressed, cared-for and educated, it is clear that they do not know much about the outside world. The children\u0027s skin is also cold at the touch.In fact the children are confined to the bunker which is the underground part of the military base. The premises, which double as a schoolroom and living quarters, are filled with surveillance cameras. Access to the children is limited though they are occasionally visited by men in radiation suits. Bernard gives them lessons via a TV monitor, but dismisses some of their more searching questions, saying that they will learn the answers \"when the time comes\".The children do not even know much about where they are. One of them actually believes that they are in a spaceship and are to populate a distant planet.The children have a small hideout in a connecting cave where they keep pictures and mementoes of people they think are their parents. They believe that it is a safe and secret place but Bernard and his associates are well aware of it. Bernard, who is, in his own way, genuinely fond of the children, has allowed them this degree of privacy in spite of objections by the head of security Major Holland (Walter Gotell).Time passes and Wells, Joan and King feel increasingly unwell, but Wells and Joan have promised to help the children escape and pressure King into helping them. The children keep them fed by ably smuggling food pass the surveillance cameras into the hideout.Since security has been unable to find the intruders, Bernard tells the children via the TV monitor that he knows their secret and asks that they give up the grown-ups that they are hiding there. He reminds them of a rabbit they once acquired as a pet but which later died and warns them that the same might happen to their would-be rescuers. The children rebel and destroy the cameras.Men in radiation suits then enter the premises but are overpowered and even killed by Wells and King. Using a Geiger counter, Wells discovers that it is in fact the children themselves who are radioactive. Nevertheless he agrees to break them out. They escape the bunker and face the world, the Sun and flowers for the first time.But before they can take it all in, they are rounded up and, kicking and screaming, are taken back to the bunker by other men in radiation suits. Freya Neilson, the sculptress, witnesses the events.King drives off in a sports car accompanied by Henry (Kit Williams), one of the children. Weakened by the radioactivity, King orders Henry out of the car saying that he is \"poison\". Henry is then grabbed by pursuers and forcibly taken back to the bunker in a helicopter.Chased by another helicopter, King crashes his car into a river. Joan and Wells are allowed to leave on his boat, but the sickness catches up with them and the boat goes round and round in the sea monitored by a military helicopter, which will destroy the boat once its occupants are dead.Bernard\u0027s only real regret about the whole affair is that \"his\" children now know for sure that they are \"freaks\" and prisoners and will be more difficult to control. He explains to Neilson that they were radioactive from birth. The plan is to release them \"when the time comes\", i.e. the inevitable nuclear war. Their bodies will resist the nuclear fallout and the human race will continue. Now that Neilson knows his secret, Bernard kills her. (In the 1950s and early 60s, the threat of nuclear war was very real, a matter of \"when\" not \"if\", and culminated in the Cuban Missile Crisis.)The film ends with the children desperately and vainly calling for help from their cliff side prison.","numvotes":"3447","primarytitle":"The Damned","productioncompany":"Hammer Films","countriesoforigin":"United Kingdom","averagerating":"6.6","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"The Damned","sex of artist":"female","storyline":"The middle-aged American Simon Wells sails in his boat to Weymouth and stumbles with the twenty year-old Joan on the street.

Now as the movie opens, they are attending the wedding of Ralph Hapschatt (Jeremy Newson) and Betty Monroe (Hilary Labow) in which Brad is Ralph\u0027s best man and Janet is the maid of honor. Inspired by the events around him, as soon as the other guests leave, Brad asks Janet to marry him in a song (\u0027Damnit Janet\u0027) inside the church and she accepts. Joyous, the couple decide to go tell Dr. Scott the good news.Appearing all through the movie, a Criminologist (Charles Gray) comes on and explains that we are about to embark on a strange journey following the misadventures of Brad and Janet. He mentions that despite the storm clouds gathering, the two decided to go for a long drive in the country anyway even though their spare tire was badly in need of air. He claims that Brad and Janet will have \"a night to remember for a very long, time.\"Back to Brad and Janet, as they drive on, the sun sets and, sure enough, it begins to rain very heavily. Janet is starting to feel ill at ease considering how far out they are and that a bunch of bikers keep passing them on the road and suggests that they should turn back before something bad happens. We hear a loud BANG! and the car skids to a stop.Brad realizes he messed up badly by not refilling the spare tire and suggests that the two of them go to an old castle they passed along the way to call for help. Janet isn\u0027t so sure this is a good idea, but Brad talks her into it anyway as there\u0027s not much they can do otherwise. As they walk through the rain, Janet tries to shield herself with a newspaper, telling herself through a song that no matter how bad things get, there\u0027s always a good side and that things will always get better. (\u0027There\u0027s a Light... over at the Frankenstein Place\u0027)Soon the two arrive on the front doorstep of the castle. Brad knocks and just as the two were about to leave, the door is opened by Riffraff (Richard O\u0027Brien), a tall, gaunt, balding butler in a stark black suit. He glares at them, further unnerving Janet, though Brad tries to be friendly, introducing himself and Janet and explaining that they need a phone as their car has broken down nearby.The foyer is outlandishly decorated with dark wooden furniture, stuffed dead animals and hunting trophies, and random relics and curiosities. Riffraff explains to Brad and Janet that they\u0027ve arrived on a very special night as \"the master\" is having a party, where Brad and Janet meet the equally strainge house maid Magenta (Patricia Quinn), which leads into the infamous song \"The Time Warp\".The Criminologist comes on and explains the steps to the \u0027Time Warp\u0027 dance.Brad and Janet are ushered into a great hall with a throne and a jukebox at it\u0027s far end where conventionists of every size and description wearing tuxedos and party hats are dancing and singing the (\u0027Time Warp\u0027). During the song we are introduced to the gold-sequin-wearing, tap dancing Columbia (Little Nell). All of this is too much for Janet and Brad who try to sneak out carefully. Janet begs Brad to leave as the place is creepy, but Brad simply says that they should stay to watch more \"folk dancing.\" Janet refuses as she\u0027s \"cold, wet and just plain scared!\", though Brad tries to reassure her.Janet turns around to leave and sees Dr. Frank N. Furter (Tim Curry) in full drag regalia, wrapped up in a black cloak. She screams and faints. Frank introduces himself though a song as a (\u0027Sweet Transvestite\u0027) from Transsexual, Transylvania\". Brad asks him for help, explaining his plight, and Frank smirks and acknowledges that yeah, Brad needs help, and offers him a mechanic at first only to change his mind as \"Maybe the rain isn\u0027t REALLY to blame\" and instead decides to \"remove the cause but NOT the symptoms.\"Frank then goes into an elevator and rises upstairs to the applause of the partying conventionists. Riffraff and Magenta strip Brad and Janet down to their underwear. Brad and Janet then are prodded into the elevator and taken upstairs to Frank\u0027s laboratory.Brad and Janet are led out into the center of an observing room where they are put on display by Dr. Frank N. Furter, now wearing a lab coat and long surgical gloves. The Transylvanian conventionists watch the events from an above balcony. Frank N. Furter then walks over to a box-like shape covered by a tarp and throws off the covering to reveal a tank. He shouts for Magenta and Riffraff to set the controls and start the machinery as the room darkens. Frank himself laughs maniacally as he turns knobs, dials, and wheels as fluids pour into the tank and a humanoid form appears slowly, skeleton first, much to Janet and Brad\u0027s terror.Carefully, Frank N. Furter leads out the humanoid figure wrapped entirely in bandages and cuts them away to reveal a full-grown man with blond hair, tanned skin, blue eyes and a muscular figure wearing only a skimpy golden bikini over his crotch. Riffraff spins some wheels he shouldn\u0027t have while cackling to himself, setting the blond man, known as Rocky Horror (Peter Hinwood), loose. Frank chases Rocky through the lab crying his name as a bouncy song about the creation (\u0027I Can Make You a Man\u0027), Rocky feeling a sense of dread plays. Eventually Frank catches Rocky and scolds him for misbehaving, but says he forgives him as he\u0027s beautiful (\u0027Sword of Damocles\u0027).Then, the deep freeze malfunctions and Columbia squeals, \"Eddie!\" A burly, heavyset biker named Eddie (Meatloaf) rides out on a motorcycle, dressed in black leather, singing about his former glory (\u0027Whatever Happened to Saturday Night?/Hot Patootie\u0027) The conventionists eat it up, enjoying the show, but Frank becomes wrathful that Eddie stole his thunder and takes out a pickax, chasing Eddie into the deep freeze where he is hacked to bits. This puts everyone, even the giddy conventionists into a shocked and somber mood. Frank, tires to pick things up by talking about how beautiful Rocky is in a song (\u0027I Can Make You a Man, reprise\u0027), leading away his new creation to a \"bedchamber\" in a wedding-style procession.The Criminologist comes on again and mentions that Brad and Janet are in trouble now as they are being led away to separate rooms for the night.While separated, Frank N. Furter comes into Janet\u0027s bedroom, dressed as Brad, and seduces Janet. Then he goes into Brad\u0027s room, dressed as Janet and tries to seduce Brad. Brad puts up a little bit of a fight, but is talked into it. Afterwards, Janet feels frightened and used and goes to look for Brad. Meanwhile, Rocky escapes from the bedchamber and is running loose, chased by dogs through the rain outside the castle by the gleeful Riffraff. While wandering the castle lost and afraid, Janet encounters Rocky hiding in his tank at the lab. Seeing that he\u0027s injured, she tears her petticoat to bandage his wounds, pausing as she realizes she\u0027s aroused.The Criminologist comes on and mentions the complexity of human emotions and the dangers of lust. He fades away to Magenta and Columbia who are secretly watching Rocky and Janet in the tank via a monitor in their room.Janet tries to seduce Rocky, explaining that she used to be a virgin, but now she finds she really likes sex and wants it NOW (\u0027Toucha Toucha Touch Me\u0027). Rocky is more than happy to oblige. Meanwhile, Columbia and Magenta watch in secret from the closed circuited TV, laughing and playing with one another, making fun of the events unfolding before them.As the two women enjoy one another, Frank N. Furter beats up Riffraff for letting Rocky loose, while Brad watches with horror. An alarm goes off and Riffraff looks on another TV monitor and mentions that someone is outside by the main gate as they all look and see a middle aged man in a wheelchair buzzing the intercom at the front gate. Dr. Everett Scott (Jonathan Adams) has arrived at the castle. Brad recognizes his old teacher and is happy to see him, but Frank N. Furter is angry that the two know one another, recognizing Dr. Scott as a federal agent investigating UFOs, suspecting Brad and Janet are actually spies. Brad denies this, explaining that Dr. Scott is his science teacher from Denton High, but Frank doesn\u0027t believe him.Meanwhile, Dr. Scott enters the castle and finds himself alone in the \u0027zen room\u0027 filled with various smoldering insence. Frank N. Furter takes Brad to the lab where he turns on a powerful magnet to drag Dr Scott\u0027s wheelchair up to them... with Dr. Scott still inside it. The clunk of Dr. Scott\u0027s wheelchair arriving wakes the sleeping Janet and Rocky who sit up in shock. Everyone in the room is frightened, confused and hurt to see one another here. Magenta appears up and announces that dinner is ready. Attempting to handle things with grace, Dr. Frank N. Furter dismisses everyone for dinner, informing them that formal attire is optional as he stomps off enraged.Everyone meets in a grand dining room for a dinner of roasted beef and vegetables in honor of Rocky\u0027s Birthday. Frank demands that everyone sing Rocky \"Happy Birthday.\" Dr. Scott reveals in a song (\u0027Eddie\u0027s Teddy\u0027) that he\u0027s not here to investigate Frank and his household, but to look for his nephew, Eddie, who went missing with a cryptic cry for help in a letter being the last contact he had from him. Sure, Eddie was a no good kid, but he\u0027s still family. In response to this, the tablecloth is pulled off the table to reveal Eddie\u0027s hacked-up body in a glass case... and the fact that they were being served roast Eddie for dinner. Brad and Dr. Scott are paralyzed with terror, and Janet runs to Rocky\u0027s arms. Frank is outraged, slapping Janet. Janet runs away with Frank chasing after her, encouraging her through a song (\u0027Once in a While\u0027) to stop sleeping with everyone else as she\u0027s now his.Janet, followed by Frank N. Furter, Rocky, Brad, and Dr. Scott end up in the lab again. Frank pulls a switch to \"glue\" everyone\u0027s feet to the floor but his. Everyone tells Frank he\u0027s a \"Hot dog.\" In response, he simply flips a switch and turns them all to stone. Columbia comes in and tells Frank he\u0027s gone too far this time as now people are really hurt. Frank N Furter simply responds by turning Columbia to stone, too. He then tells Riffraff and Magenta to prepare for the floor show.The Criminologist comes on and hints that in this place where nothing\u0027s as it seems, the Floor Show is going to be something very shocking.The next scene we see the statue versions of everyone on stage, now all wearing fishnets, makeup, a thong and the same bustier. One by one they are unfrozen, and they each sing and dance a song (\u0027Floor Show\u0027) about how they\u0027ve changed since they came here. Rocky and Columbia sing about their past times (\u0027Rose Tint My World\u0027). Frank N. Furter, Brad and Janet sing their own version (\u0027Fanfare/Don\u0027t Dream It\u0027). Dr. Scott is accidentally unfrozen and realizes that this place is a trap and everyone should run while they still are sane enough to escape. Frank N. Furter comes out like a prized showgirl and sings a solo, starting an orgy in a swimming pool that is uncovered as he sings. After the orgy, Frank N. Furter sings a song praising his wild and untamed household (\u0027Wild and Untamed Thing\u0027).This song, however is interrupted by Riffraff and Magenta, now wearing strange uniforms and armed with laser ray guns. Riffraff informs Frank that it\u0027s all over as his mission was a failure due to Frank becoming too extreme. He declares that Frank is now his and Magenta\u0027s prisoner as he has been made commander, and that they\u0027re going back to their home planet of Transylvania in the Galaxy of Transexual immediately. Frank is happy for this, singing about how long he\u0027s been wanting to go back to the homeland he was exiled from (\u0027I\u0027m Going Home\u0027). Riffraff stops him again and explains that only he and Magenta are going home; Frank N. Furter is to be killed as Riffraff replies: \"say hello to oblivion\". Riffraff points a ray gun at Frank, but Columbia screams in an attempt to save Frank. Riffraff quickly turns around and kills her. Riffraff then kills Frank as he tries to run away. Rocky, seeing his creator fall, grabs Frank and climbs the set in the background of the stage, crying in rage and pain. It takes several shots from the ray gun, but Rocky is killed and falls into the pool where he and his creator float dead.Riffraff turns to Brad, Janet and Dr. Scott and tells them to leave now while they still can and they do so. Meanwhile, in a now empty house, Magenta and Riffraff celebrate going home as an incestuous relationship is implied. Brad and Janet, carrying Dr. Scott, escape just as the castle explodes and flies away under a rainbow and blue skies of dawn back to Riffraff and Magenta\u0027s home planet, leaving Dr. Scott, Janet, and Brad writing on the charred ground, still in drag from the floor show as it flies away into space. (In some versions the three of them sing one final song about loss of innocence called \u0027Superheros\u0027.)The Criminologist comes back one last time with the somber, iconic lines describing the flying away of the house:\"And crawling... on the planet\u0027s face... some insects... called the human race.

On the night of her arrival there is a torrential downpour. She arrives at the school by taxi, and before she can enter, she witnesses a young blonde girl (Eva Axén) fleeing the building in a panic. Suzy hears the girl shouting to someone just inside the door of the school, but the intense thunder obscures most of her words. When the other girl is gone, Suzy talks to an unidentified person on the school\u0027s intercom, but they refuse to let her inside. Unable to gain access to the school, Suzy gets back into her cab and has the driver take her away. As the cab drives through a nearby forest, Suzy sees Pat running alone through the trees that separate the school from town.The frightened girl is Pat Hingle, and she flees to a friend\u0027s apartment in the nearby town. While alone in the bathroom, she becomes transfixed by a pair of shining eyes outside the window, and a decidedly inhuman arm smashes through the glass, grabbing her. She is pulled out of the window onto the roof, stabbed numerous times, and then hanged by a cord when she falls through the sky light. The huge pieces of glass and metal that break out of the skylight fall on Pat\u0027s friend, killing her by impaling her body and her head in numerous places.Suzy goes to the school the next day and is greeted by Ms. Tanner (Alida Valli), an instructor, and Madame Blanc (Joan Bennett), the vice directress. Madame Blanc is very friendly to Suzy, especially when she realizes she knows Suzy\u0027s aunt Carol. Detectives are there investigating Pat\u0027s murder, and although Ms. Tanner tries to hurry Suzy away, Suzy volunteers a few bits of information. It seems as if there is something that she cannot remember, some realization that she can\u0027t put her finger on. Suzy meets a few other odd characters, including a strange looking handyman named Pavlo (Giuseppe Transocchi) and a blind pianist named Daniel (Flavio Bucci).In the changing room, Suzy meets two other students, Olga (Barbara Magnolfi) and Sara (Stefania Casini). Sara and Olga are not friends, and Olga taunts Sara a little. Although Suzy has requested to board at the school, the rooms are all full and it\u0027s been arranged for Suzy to live with Olga in her off-campus apartment. Although Olga initially seems very bitchy, she and Suzy get along well and have a conversation about Pat. Olga tells Suzy that Pat was a \"busybody\", and that she was always trying to find out things about other people. Suzy thinks back to seeing Pat the night before, and she suddenly remembers Pat shouting the words \"secret\" and \"iris\".The next day, Suzy sees Madame Blanc before classes, and she tells Suzy that her dorm room is now free. Suzy, however, tells Madame Blanc that she\u0027d rather live with Olga. Madame Blanc seems offended by this and walks away in a huff. Ms. Tanner sarcastically tells Suzy that she is happy she\u0027s so \"strong willed\". On her way to class immediately afterwards, Suzy passes by the cook, who is sitting in the hallway with Madame Blanc\u0027s small nephew Albert (Jacopo Mariani). The cook is polishing some silver, and she reflects a beam of sunlight at Suzy, who immediately begins to feel ill. In class, Ms. Tanner keeps pushing Suzy to dance, and Suzy passes out, bleeding from her nose and mouth.The school doctor (Renato Scarpa) puts Suzy on a restricted diet that includes cheese, fruit, and a glass of red wine. Suzy also finds that she\u0027s been moved into the dorms without her consent. Her dorm room is next to Sara\u0027s, and the two of them become friends. As the girls dress for dinner, hundreds of maggots start to fall from the ceiling. Ms. Tanner investigates the upper floor and finds that crates of spoiled food have caused the maggot infestation. Madame Blanc apologizes to the girls, and arranges for all of them to sleep in the practice hall. A wall of sheets separates the girls from the teachers, who are staying with the girls for the night. Suzy asks Sara if the teachers live in the school, but Sara tells her that they leave at 9:30 every night. When the girls sleep, a shadowy figure lays down on the other side of the sheet behind Suzy and Sara. The person has a very distinct, raspy, whistling snore and it frightens Sara, who wakes Suzy up. Sara tells her about a time last year when she had to sleep in a guest bedroom: late that night, she had heard the same snoring in the next room. Madame Blanc later told Sara that the school\u0027s directress stayed in that room, so the weird snoring means the directress is now here. This seems suspicious to Suzy and Sara, since all the girls have been told that the directress would not return to the school for weeks.The next morning, Sara asks Ms. Tanner if the directress showed up last night, but Ms. Tanner denies it. As classes start, Madame Blanc\u0027s young nephew, Albert, is attacked by Daniel\u0027s guide dog. Enraged, Ms. Tanner interrupts class and tells Daniel never to bring the dog back or she\u0027ll have it put to sleep. Daniel yells at her and insists his dog would never harm anyone. Ms. Tanner throws Daniel\u0027s cane to the floor and tells him to get out, humiliating him as he fumbles around trying to find it. Daniel is enraged, and makes a veiled threat to Ms. Tanner: he is blind, but not deaf. Ms. Tanner is furious.That night, after Suzy eats her meal Sara comes into her room and they listen while the teachers supposedly leave. However, Suzy notices that the footsteps are going away from the front door; therefore the teachers are not really leaving the school at all, but going someplace inside. Sara begins to wonder where they go, but Suzy becomes extremely drowsy and can hardly stay awake. Sara takes out a notebook and writes down the number of footsteps as the instructors walk by.Daniel, who has been out at a bar, leaves with his dog. While in the middle of an empty piazza, his dog begins to bark at something. Daniel tries to calm down the dog, but he just gets more restless as they walk. Daniel begins to become frightened and stops, hearing strange sounds that indicate to him someone else is there. We can also see shadowy figures moving in the distance. As Daniel waits silently in the piazza, his dog suddenly attacks and kills him, tearing out his throat.Suzy is troubled by the sudden number of deaths and approaches Madame Blanc. She tells Blanc that she heard Pat say something the night she died. Although Pat had said more, Suzy only heard \"secret\" and \"irises\". Madame Blanc says she will inform the police about Suzy\u0027s information, but Sara later gets angry that Suzy told this to Madame Blanc. Sara worries that Suzy\u0027s revelation has put the teachers on a hunt for whoever Pat was talking to that night, and that the teacher will obviously identify that person as herself. As the two go for a swim in the pool, Sara tells Suzy all about her friendship with Pat, and how Pat had been taking notes for months about strange occurrences at the school. However, when Sara is going to show them to Suzy that night, the notes are gone; now she knows that the evil forces in the school are onto her and her time is short. The only thing she has left is the list of footsteps she made. Sara tries to get Suzy to help her, but once again Suzy cannot stay awake. Sara begins to hear footsteps and flees Suzy\u0027s room just before an unseen person enters. Sara escapes to the attic, where she is attacked but hides in a room and latches the door shut. Her stalker tries to use a strait razor to unlatch the door. With nowhere else to go, Sara cowers away from the door when she notices a small window near the ceiling. Stacking several boxes on top of each other, she leaps through the window and into the next room; unfortunately, the small room is filled to the brim with large, unruly bushels of razor wire. She tries to escape to an open door a few feet away but keeps getting tangled and cut. Just as she is near the door, the killer slices her throat.The next morning, Suzy finds Sara\u0027s room empty. Ms. Tanner tells Suzy that Sara left early that morning without telling anyone. Suzy meets with a friend of Sara\u0027s, who turns out to be Sara\u0027s psychologist. He tells Suzy that Sara became troubled when a friend put the notion of witches in her head. Sara also found out that the school was founded by Helena Markos, a Greek émigré, who people thought was a witch. Markos was persecuted wherever she went, and she founded the school for the study of occult sciences and arts. However, Markos died in a fire, and the school was passed down to her favorite pupil who turned it from a school for the occult to a dance academy. Suzy talks to a colleague of Dr. Mandel who specializes in witches, Professor Milius. Milius explains to Suzy that witches are negative forces that change events only to do harm, and their goal is to gain personal wealth that can only be achieved by injury to others. He also tells her that a coven of witches can only do magic with the power of their queen. Otherwise, they are harmless.Back at school, Suzy finds out that all the students are gone. She asks a servant, who tells her that all the students went to the theater, and that Ms. Tanner got the tickets. Suzy tries to call Frank Mandel, but a storm knocks out the phones. In her room, Suzy dumps her food out, and throws the wine down the sink, which looks suspiciously like blood. Afterwards, she is attacked by a vicious bat that flies in the bathroom window. She begins to hear the teachers footsteps, and remembers counting them with Sara. Following the count, Suzy traces their path and ends up in Madame Blanc\u0027s empty office, where the footsteps stopped. With only one door, she knows the teachers exited somehow. Glancing into a mirror, she notices irises painted on the wall in the elaborate grotto illustration that adorns Madame Blanc\u0027s office. Suddenly Suzy remembers what she had forgotten. When exiting the school, Pat said \"The secret! I saw behind the door! Three irises! Turn the blue one!\"Suzy turns the blue iris and a hidden door pops open. She sneaks down a hallway and, hiding behind a curtain, she sees the entire coven meeting with Madame Blanc, who is sitting on a throne. She and the others discuss how they will kill Suzy. Conducting a black mass ritual, Madame Blanc partakes of some kind of communion wafer and says \"Queen Helena, give me power!\" Afraid they might find her, Suzy backs away and stumbles upon Sara\u0027s corpse. She flees into a connecting room, which turns out to be a bedroom. Asleep in the bed, obscured by sheer white curtains, is a shadowy figure, snoring loudly--the same weird snoring of the directress, whom Suzy now realizes is Helena Markos. Frightened, Suzy knocks over an ornamental statue which wakes up Helena Markos. In a horrible, raspy voice, Helena speaks to Suzy: \"The American girl! I knew you\u0027d come. You want to kill me!\" Suzy picks up one of the sharp glass feathers from the statue and pulls back the curtain of the bed only to find it empty. Confused, Suzy looks around while Markos taunts her. A door slowly opens, and Sara\u0027s corpse, back to life and wielding a knife, approaches Suzy. As lightning strikes, Suzy notices a slight outline of Markos still sitting there on the bed; she is simply invisible. Suzy stabs her through the neck. Sara disappears, and the burnt features of Markos become visible as she dies; the weapon has penetrated through her entire neck, and she chokes to death. Things in the bedroom begin to explode, and Suzy rushes out. As she passes by their meeting room, she sees Madame Blanc, Miss Tanner, and the others, all collapsed and bleeding due to the death of Markos. Suzy runs away, and everywhere she goes, power exudes from her, destroying all in her path. Doors explode outwards before she can touch them, and walls crack and break as she passes. Finally she reaches the exit and walks out into the rain as the house burns behind her. Suzy smiles cryptically as she walks away from the school. Perhaps she is simply happy to have escaped, or perhaps it is as the legend goes, that whoever kills a witch inherits her power.","numvotes":"90183","primarytitle":"Suspiria","productioncompany":"Seda Spettacoli","countriesoforigin":"Italy","averagerating":"7.4","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"Suspiria","storyline":"Suzy Bannion travels to Germany to perfect her ballet skills.

We are told the time is 1945 and the place is Asia. A group of G.I.s are wandering around an Indian bazaar. Paul Able (Richard Long) and Pete Norton (William Reynolds) are at a table selling cloth. Pete asks Tom Markel (Marshall Thompson) what he thinks of the cloth. Rico Nardi (David Janssen) directs the men\u0027s attention to a snake charmer. Nick Hommel (James Dobson) and Carl Turner (Jack Kelly) join the others around a basket. They take a few pictures then talk to the snake charmer, Daru (Leonard Strong). For $2 he agrees to hold the snake. Paul asks about a cult that believes snakes can be transformed into humans. Daru is visibly surprised. One man says he\u0027d give anything to see it. This piques Daru\u0027s interest. He tells the men that he is a Lamian and for $100 he will show them, \"she who is a snake, and yet a woman.\" They make arrangements to see the ceremony that evening, but Daru warns them that pictures are forbidden.The men meet and get reasonably drunk. Daru shows up as promised. He gets them past the guards. They are dressed like locals. He warns them that if they are discovered they will be killed. They enter a large curtain lined room. On a raised platform there is a stone shrine and a large basket. They discover Nick is missing from the group. A dancer performs a ritual and out of the basket a woman emerges and dances. The ritual includes the snake woman biting and killing a man. Against orders, Nick takes a picture; his flash angers the assembled men. Nick is attacked. The other five men start a fight as Nick grabs the basket and makes his way to the exit. One of the Lamians (Edward Platt) tells them, \"The Cobra Goddess will avenge herself. One by one you will die!\" Just prior to exiting, Tom sets the curtains on fire to create a diversion. Daru is killed by the mob. The five men escape in the jeep, but Nick is still missing. They spot a woman walking away from the basket and discover Nick on the ground. Tom chases the woman but she escapes. Nick is still alive, but they discover a snake bite on his neck. Tom performs a hasty snake bite remedy to remove most of the venom. Carl, Rico and Pete carry Nick to the jeep. Tom tells Paul, \"Lets get out of here.\" They return to the base. They are supposed to ship out the next morning.Nick Hommel is in a hospital bed surrounded by his buddies. He tells the men he wanted the basket as a souvenir. The nurse (Mary Alan Hokanson) arrives to take Nick\u0027s temperature and asks the men to leave. She adjusts the window down a bit to keep out the rain. Outside a cobra works its way towards the building. It enters Nicks room. He sees it and screams, but a clap of thunder muffles his cry. The next morning Major Martin Fielding (Olan Soule) tells Paul Able that Nick died early in the morning. He succumbed to neurotoxic venom that paralyzed his heart. After Paul leaves to catch his transport home, Fielding explains to Capt. Steve Williams (Alan Reynolds) that he is puzzled also. Most of the venom was removed from Nick before he was admitted to the hospital, but by morning he had been re-infected. The body was loaded with cobra venom.The men fly home on a DC-3. They discuss their post-military lives. Rico will be running his Dad\u0027s bowling alley. All the men are discharged from the military and begin their civilian lives.On the streets of New York City, Paul Able and his fiancé, Julia Thompson (Kathleen Hughes) have come to see Rico Nardi at the bowling alley. She tells Tom she is going to marry Paul. She still needs to tell Rico. Tom is initially angry and disappointed and tells Rico the good news before Julia has the chance. She had been dating Tom and Rico before she got serious with Paul. Tom and Paul are roommates. In his apartment, Tom\u0027s dog is restless and wakes him in the middle of the night. He goes to the kitchen and hears a woman scream. He exits his apartment and forces the door to the apartment across from his. He finds Lisa Moya (Faith Domergue) against the wall sobbing. She tells Tom there was a man in her apartment. Tom checks the apartment, finds no one, then picks up the phone to call the police. Lisa tells him no, no police. She tells him to stay a while. She explains that she just moved into the apartment today and has only been in the city a week. He tells her he is a commercial artist--advertising. They agree to a date the next day to see the city.They meet the next day and visit some of the sights in the city: Staten Island Ferry, the Statue of Liberty, Wall Street and the Fulton Fish Market. They stop at a hot dog stand for lunch. That evening they return home, but she rebuffs his advance to kiss her. Tom introduces Lisa to his roommate, Paul and the dog freaks out. She sees a picture and picks it up. It is a picture of the six men taken when they were deployed in Asia. Tom explains who and where everyone is now. They agree to meet on Sunday at Carl\u0027s apartment; he is having a party. No sooner is she back in her apartment, but she gets her coat and leaves. She walks along the street and encounters a cat that screeches at her and runs away. It is apparent she just doesn\u0027t have a way with animals, any animals. At Rico\u0027s bowling alley, Carl and Pete, who are also roommates, pay their tab and leave. Rico is closing up the place when Lisa arrives outside. A bowling pin falls over and Rico investigates. He carries a case of beer out to his car for Carl\u0027s party. Mrs. Webber (Helen Wallace) asks for a donation for a charitable organization. Rico heads back inside to close up. He grabs his coat, locks the door and gets in his car. He drives off, whistling, sees the cobra in the rear view mirror, panics and runs his car off the street. He rolls the car and is killed instantly. Lisa walks back to her apartment.The remaining four men and Lisa attend Rico\u0027s funeral. Carl decides to have the party on Sunday. As Tom and Paul walk with Lisa back home a horse freaks out at her presence. She tells Paul she\u0027s always been afraid of horses. Paul is beginning to believe Lisa is not who she claims to be and is increasingly worried about her influence over Tom. He is starting to believe the curse is real and they are all destined to be killed.At Carl\u0027s party, Lisa is dancing with the host. Tom is jealous. At one point he slugs Carl and tells Lisa to get her coat, they\u0027re leaving. Paul tells Carl, \"I\u0027m sure she\u0027s no good for him.\" Paul meets Julia after she returns from her show out of town. She is back in New York rehearsing--she is an actress. Paul asks her to talk to Tom. He admits he\u0027s afraid of Lisa. It has to do with Rico\u0027s death. He doesn\u0027t think it was an accident. He tells her about the cult story. He thinks Lisa is involved.Tom returns from his date with Lisa at Carl\u0027s party. They talk and he tells her he loves her. She leaves and returns to her own apartment. He checks on the dog. Tom notices that Lisa forgot her gloves. He tries to return them. He knocks on her door, but she doesn\u0027t answer. He uses the key he borrowed earlier to get some ice and lets himself in. He discovers she isn\u0027t there. He sits and has a smoke and waits for her. The party is over at Carl\u0027s and everyone is leaving. Pete leaves with Marian Sheehan (Myrna Hansen) his date for the evening. Carl set them up. He is going to take her home, then return. They leave the building. Lisa sees them and hides, and then enters the building. She knocks on Carl\u0027s door; he invites her in. She tells him she wanted to apologize for spoiling the party. She tells him she really came back to see him. Carl goes into the kitchen to mix some drinks, but when he returns to the living room Lisa is gone. He goes over to a chair and sees the cobra. He strikes it with a plaster vase, but it bites him and he falls over a railing and down to his death on the sidewalk. Pete returns and finds a crowd gathered around Carl\u0027s body. Lisa joins the crowd and Pete warns her not to look. The police arrive and ask if anyone knows the deceased. Pete volunteers that he and Carl were roommates. The police ask Pete to come with them. Lisa returns home to find Tom sleeping on her couch. They talk about their relationship. She voices her concern about hurting him.The next morning Paul makes breakfast for him and Tom. They talk. He tells Tom he and Julia are going down for their marriage license. The telephone rings; its the police asking about Carl. They want to see both Paul and Tom immediately. Paul tells them they will be right down.Pete Norton\u0027s blood is checked for type. The Police Inspector (Walter Coy) tells the lab tech when Paul and Tom arrive he wants their blood typed as well. The Inspector interrogates Pete then releases him. Julia is at Tom and Paul\u0027s apartment reading up on cults. Lisa stops by for her usual breakfast coffee and inquires about Tom and Paul. Julia tells her they are at the police station. Julia tells Lisa about Paul\u0027s recent fascination with cults and cobras. She tells Lisa that there are people that believe they can turn into snakes. Lisa responds strangely. Julia adds that Paul fells that is why Rico, Carl and Nick are dead. Julia hastily departs after paying the dry cleaner for some shirts delivered.The Police Inspector interrogates Tom and Paul. They are released to go when the blood tests reveal they were not involved directly in Carl\u0027s death. Before he leaves, Paul volunteers the cult story. Paul accuses Lisa of being an agent for the curse. Tom storms off. Back at Lisa\u0027s apartment, Pete Norton confronts Lisa over a scratch on her arm. He believes it came from the vase Carl threw at the cobra. He accuses her of being a Lamian. She goes to her bedroom under the pretense of getting her passport to prove she was elsewhere when Nick was killed in India. There we see her, in shadow, transform into a cobra. She leaves her apartment and collects Tom at his. They sit and have coffee. They are formally dressed for Julia\u0027s Broadway show that evening.The Police Inspector tells Paul that, working on his story, they checked the autopsy reports on Carl Turner and Rico Nardi. It was death by snake venom, a large one. He agrees to pick up Lisa for questioning. The police force the door on Lisa\u0027s apartment and find Pete\u0027s body. He has two puncture wounds on his neck. Paul calls the Theatre to talk to Tom. Lisa goes up to Julia\u0027s dressing room looking for Paul. Paul tells Tom they found Pete dead in Lisa\u0027s apartment. The police leave Lisa\u0027s apartment and drive over to the Theatre. Julia returns to her dressing room while Tom notices Lisa is missing from her box seat. A door slowly opens and Julia notices the cobra on the floor. She screams. Tom enters her dressing room and is confronted by the snake. He throws a costume over it. He breaks a window with a chair and using a coat rack pushes the cobra out the window. When the police arrive we see the cobra transform back into Lisa, dead on the street below the window. A crowd gathers. We close with an anguished Tom walking away down the street.

The astronomer is very much excited, and, rushing over to the large telescope he tries to discover by what means she had vanished. The moon now appears, and begins her repast by eating the immense telescope used by the astronomer. The astronomer flies around apparently wild at the loss of his wonderful telescope.

As they watch, the view changes direction back toward Earth as seen from Andromeda but millions of years ago. A meteor is shown hurtling towards Earth and striking in the southern portion of Africa. Those viewing this are stunned. Various comments are made, saying this is no hoax.Back in the house, brandy is served. Sir Francis marvels at the discovery to Janos, asking when he will publish it to the scientific world. He says it is not yet ready. Sir Francis says it would be good to locate this meteor and see what it contains. Dr. Benet suggests that Janos join them in an expedition. Janos says he has no standing before their scientific congress and that he had previously been declared unorthodox and discredited. Sir Francis tells him their expedition will not be under the auspices of any scientific association. Dr. Benet says that he will be doing them an honor. Janos accepts, but Mother Rukh tells him no. She says he may make an important discovery but that it will not bring him happiness. She reminds him that Janos is not good with people but is better suited to remain with his experiments.A scientific magazine is shown that has an article about Dr. Benets expedition to Africa to recover Radium X. It mentions that Dr. Rukh has separated from the others. Meanwhile, at a camp in Nigeria, Dr. Benet shows Sir Francis how he has been healing natives by a medicine he derived from sunlight. A young native child is shown and given back to his mother. Diane sits in her tent, hot, tired and bored to death since her husband left them to go on his own expedition. She emerges from her tent only to see Lady Arabella and Ronald returning from a hunting trip. Seeing him stirs her. She turns away, not wanting to look. A conversation with Ronald and Lady Arabella about Diane reveals that they are interested in each other, but that Ronald dares not act because she is married. Meanwhile Sir Francis says he is sick of staying in Africa and will not remain for the sake of anyone.A safari group accompanying Janos arrives near a volcano when suddenly a loud buzzing and clicking sound coming from one of the boxes carried by a native frightens him. It is revealed to be a Giger counter showing the presence of radioactivity. Janos takes the machine and approaches a site giving off steam or smoke. He tells the leader to send a message back to the camp by his fastest runner. A runner is selected by the leader and Janos writes out a message, telling him to give it to Diana and wait for an answer. He says he has found what he is looking for, but not to tell anyone where they are.Antelope stew is served at the camp, but not everyone is interested in eating. Diane and Ronald avoid glances over the table at each other, but it is obvious that they are mutually interested in each other and this causes great discomfort. About this time the runner arrives and the note is given to Diane, who reads it. She reports only that Janos will not return right away but believes he is on the right track. Going to her tent, she asks the leader to meet with her and the runner. A small team is prepared to accompany her to see her husband. This is observed by Ronald, who then confronts Diane of her plans. She tells him she must go to her husband right away. He tells her hes not surprised that she wouldnt disappoint any man.Dressed in a protective suit and helmet, Janos is lowered into the volcano by rope controlled by natives. He uses a mining hammer to extract a sample of glowing, sparkling rock which he puts into a safe container. Returning to the natives, he is told they do not like the area because there are many devils. After the leader tells him they all want to leave, he tells them to watch a rock standing alone on a precipice. Loading the rock sample into a projector, he focuses it on the rock and shines the beam. The rock is disintegrated and melted before their eyes. He tells them they may leave if they want to, but threatens to turn the ray on them if they do. They beg and pledge their continued support.That night a meal is brought to Janos by one of the natives. He tells him to take the lantern inside the tent so it will not attract bugs. When the light is taken away, Janos begins glowing in his hands and face. Seeing this, the native cries out in horror. Janos sees his hands glowing and enters the tent. Turning down the lantern, he grabs a mirror and sees his face glowing. When the light is turned on, the glow cannot be seen. He remarks to himself that it has poisoned him. Sitting down on his cot to think, the dog approaches him and he reaches to pet it. The dog dies, and Janos realizes that his touch is deadly.Diane and her party arrive and she is pointed toward his tent. Seeing her coming, Janos draws the tent closed and turns out his lantern, hoping she will not enter. She notices the light go out and stops at the tent door to call him. Not wanting her to see or touch him, Janos questions why she came and tells her she must leave in the morning. She is shown a tent for her to stay the night, but is heartbroken and cries upon her cot. Janos gathers up the rock sample along with his mask and protective suit and starts out into the dark. Passing close by her tent, he hears her sobbing and pauses.Dr. Benet is shown mixing chemicals in his tent. Wearing full protective gear, Janos shows up with the runner and calls out to Benet, entering the tent. He tells Benet not to touch him, saying that he found the element and it is ten times more powerful than radium but that it has poisoned him. They step outside into the darkness and Benet witnesses Janos hands and face glowing. Confessing that his touch is deadly, they re-enter the tent. Janos asks Benet for help. Benet says there is an antidote for radium poisoning which is made from radium. Janos gives him a sample of the element and his chemical analysis which he has written down. Benet says he will begin at once to develop an antidote and that Janos can hide in a small equipment tent.Diane leaves on her way back to base camp. Meanwhile, Dr. Benet wakes Janos, and shows him in the dark that his skin no longer glows. He tells him that the antidote was given him at midnight and that the effect is only temporary. Touching his hand, he demonstrates that Janos is not lethal at this time, but cautions him that he must take doses of this daily for the rest of his life or the condition will recur and eventually kill him. Janos is given the formula on paper as well as a kit containing samples of the antidote and a syringe.Diane and Ronald have a discussion about their relationship, saying there is no point in denying it now. At this point a bell rings, calling them to supper.Natives sound jungle drums. Dr. Benet arrives at Janos camp and approaches him. When asked how Benet found him, he is told they followed the sound of the drums, which stated that a white man had found magic in the mountains. They go into the tent and Janos tells him that he has harnessed the power of the element to destroy cities. Benet asks if he can develop its power to heal and do good. Saying that will come later, he brags about his great discovery. Benet tells him that this was anticipated by himself and Sir Francis and that they must all share the discovery. Benet says Stevens is on his way to present the sample to the International Scientific Congress meeting in Paris. Janos argues that it is his discovery and says they are stealing it from him. Benet assures him that Janos will receive credit for it but reminds him they are united for a common purpose and that this element is too powerful and important to entrust to just one man. He says that Diane has taken ill and gone back to England. Janos is given a note from his wife, telling him that she believes that he no longer loves her and is now involved with someone else. Benet confirms that it is Drake. This further infuriates Janos, who tells Benet to leave before he turns the ray on him. Benet leaves.A newspaper shows that the Benet expedition has left Africa and that Dr. Rukh has returned to his lab in the Carpathian Mountains. Inside, Janos turns the ray on his mothers eyes, hoping to restore her sight. After a few moments, she confirms that she can see. She tells him he has much work to do, but he tells her he is leaving in the morning for Paris. She warns him not to go, for he will find tragedy there. In case of tragedy, he says, keep the formula which he has written down and sealed in an envelope for his mother to keep.In Paris we see Dr. Benet in his office who sees many patients, using the ray to heal. One girl has her sight restored and she and her parents rejoice. At this moment Janos arrives and Benet tells him that his discovery is helping to heal many people. Benet tells Janos that the Nobel Prize has been awarded to Janos and that all Paris is waiting to honor him. Janos says it looks like he is late again and declares that only he can correctly harness its power. Benet reminds him that is why the discovery was too important to entrust to just one man. Saying the counter-active is still working, Janos asks about Diane. He is told that she is working for Lady Arabella and that she and Ronald are in love. Benet tells him that Diane will do nothing until she hears from Janos. He replies that will happen soon enough and leaves.Wandering through the city, Janos finds a man who looks like himself and promises to help the man. About the same height and build, they go off together.Lady Arabella is seen dictating to Diane, who types onto paper. The maid comes bringing the newspaper and giving it to Arabella. She reads the headline and gives it to Diane. It shows that Dr. Rukh has been found dead, his body mutilated by the effects of the Radium X.Diane and Ronald are seen at their wedding at the Church of the Six Saints. As they are leaving, Janos watches from a distance as they get into a car to leave. He looks up at the statues of the six saints and pictures each of them as representing himself, Benet, Diane, Ronald, Arabella and Francis. Taking a room facing the church, he plots to kill each of the other five people.At the Stevens home, Arabella is talking to Benet about the marriage and noted that Sir Francis has not come down from his room. She sends the butler up to see about him. Before the butler can get halfway up the stairs, one of the maids comes screaming into his arms. He goes up to see while Arabella questions the maid. She cannot speak but only screams. Rushing back down, the butler calls for Dr. Benet to come, saying only  Sir Francis! Sir Francis!. Entering his room, they find Francis dead on his bed with a look of horror on his face. Dr. Benet asks for an ultraviolet camera which he uses to shoot pictures of Francis eyes. Developing them, he sees captured in the reflection on the mans cornea the image of Janos.The next day there is a disturbance in the square below. The landlady (May Beatty) brings Janos his breakfast and the morning paper, telling him that one of the statues was destroyed. He sees in the paper the death of Sir Francis. Gazing at the second statue, he calls the name of Lady Arabella.The next day the papers announce the death of Lady Arabella, the third death in wake of the curse of Radium X. Diane and Ronald come into the bedroom where Dr. Benet and the authorities are with the body. He tells Diane not to look and for Ronald to take her away. Then he asks to show the Chief of the Surete (Georges Renavent) some evidence. As the lights are turned out, the cover is pulled back to reveal a glowing handprint on the victims neck. Benet says it was done by someone poisoned by Radium X. Meanwhile Diane blames herself for the deaths, saying they would all still be alive if she hadnt come on the expedition and married Ronald. He tells her not to think like that, saying he will fight with all his strength. She says how can you fight something you cannot see or touch?The paper headline shows that the second statue has been destroyed and people are upset. A discussion is held with Benet, Ronald and the Chief about Janos. It is suggested that the two men go into hiding. Ronald proposes a trap to draw Janos so they can arrest him. Benet says for the papers to announce that the remaining three will leave for an unknown destination after holding a lecture on Benets experiments with Radium X. He will invite distinguished scientists who will only be admitted by card which the police promise to verify. Benet warns that if the police fail to stop him at the gate that the house lights will be darkened at midnight (the time of the lecture) so that Janos can be seen glowing. It is a risk they are willing to take.The night of the lecture, the police are seen checking the cards of each scientist who enters. In the rain the last scientist, Professor Meiklejohn (Frank Reicher) is seen walking with his umbrella. Janos appears and stops him, introducing himself as someone else who remembers his lecture on radiology. Saying he is on the way to the lecture, the Professor locates his card in his pocket. Janos suggests they have a drink of Napoleon Brandy from his flask. They step aside and the flask is handed to him to drink. The touch kills Meiklejohn, who collapses. Janos takes the card and enters in his place. The police confirm him and he enters but remains outside so he can observe through a window.Inside, Benet greets everyone and tells them he must make final adjustments. Entering his lab with a gun, Benet looks around and heads for the outside door, opening it. Janos comes in and confronts him. The light is turned off, showing his glowing face and hands. Janos tells him he will kill the remaining three. Benet asks if he ever feels like he used to before the poison altered his brain. Janos answers  not often now.. When Benet reaches for his gun, Janos grabs his arm, killing him.Diane waits upstairs but is very anxious to come down. There is a knock at the door and it is opened, revealing Mother Rukh entering. Ronald greets her and she is told that Diane is upstairs. At that moment the lights are cut in the whole place. Diane lights a candle and Janos is seen going upstairs with his glowing face. She rushes into the bedroom and tries to close the door but he forces it open. He approaches to try and touch her but hesitates. Trying again, he announces he is unable to kill her and goes out. She faints. Outside on the landing, he faces his mother who tells him he broke the first rule of science. He says he needs time so he can kill Drake, taking out his kit for more of the antidote. As he does this, Mother Rukh strikes it with her cane tip, destroying the contents. As he begins to smoke, he tells her that maybe its better this way. Turning away, he goes upstairs and crashes through a window, falling to the ground below as a fireball. There is nothing left. The head of the Scientific Congress congratulates Mother Rukh for her sons work. Handing him the envelope, she says that he is dead but part of him will continue to help mankind.","numvotes":"2517","primarytitle":"The Invisible Ray"},"color":"rgb(119,86,100)","size":2.0},{"source":"Adventure","target":"tt0053085","id":"7216","attributes":{"productioncompany":"Hammer Films","countriesoforigin":"United Kingdom","averagerating":"6.7","titletype":"movie","notes":"Orientalism","originaltitle":"The Mummy","storyline":"In the 1890s a team of British archaeologists discover the untouched tomb of Princess Ananka but accidentally bring the mummified body of her High Priest back to life.

An Egyptian archaeology expedition finds an ancient badge in the sand. Archaeologists Stephen Banning [Felix Aylmer] and Joseph Whemple [Raymond Huntley] take it to show to Stephen\u0027s son John [Peter Cushing] who is resting in a nearby tent because he has a broken leg. They believe the badge indicates they are close to finding the concealed tomb of Princess Ananka on the basis that the badge may have come from one of her soldiers. Despite their excitement they are also concerned about the implications of John\u0027s leg having not been treated and therefore not healing properly. At the entrance to the tomb, they are stopped by an Egyptian man Mehemet Bey [George Pastell] who implores them not to open the tomb for fear of the consequences but Stephen and Joseph ignore him and enter. Inside they find the sarcophagus of the Princess. Joseph goes back outside to tell John of their discovery. Stephen remains inside and finds a scroll of life but as he picks it up a door in the wall of the tomb opens behind him. Outside, Joseph and John hear Stephen scream and Joseph re-enters the tomb to find Stephen comatose.Several months later and Joseph and John are removing the last of the relics from the tomb. They discuss Stephen, who has been in a mental hospital ever since and may never be cured. After everything has been removed, one of their Egyptian servants re-seals the tomb with explosives. Nearby, Mehemet Bey offers a prayer for vengeance against those who have desecrated the tomb. He has the scroll of life with him.England 1898. After three years at the mental hospital, Stephen has improved and John goes to visit him. Stephen does not remember John\u0027s broken leg but he remembers that when he read the scroll of life in Princess Ananka\u0027s tomb, he brought a mummy back to life and he becomes agitated. John does not believe him but Stephen warns him that someone has the scroll and the mummy will be released again.Two drunk men leave a nearby pub to transport a wooden crate on their horse and cart. At the nursing home, Stephen becomes agitated about the mummy again and smashes the window just as the horse and cart pass. The crate on the cart starts bouncing about so the men panic and increase their speed, but the crate becomes loose and falls off the cart into a watery bog. The police and men search for the crate but are unable to find it. Mehemet Bey appears and tells the police the men were transporting the crate to him at a nearby large house and that it contained ancient relics.At the nursing home, the doctor [Willoughby Gray] explains to John that Stephen has had to be restrained but they do not really understand the reasons for his agitation.At the bog, Mehemet Bey reads the scroll of life to resurrect the mummy [Christopher Lee]. Bey instructs the mummy to seek out those who desecrated the tomb and take vengeance against them. The mummy goes to the mental hospital, breaks through the bars of the window to Stephen\u0027s room and strangles him.At the subsequent inquest the conclusion is forced entry and murder by person or persons unknown. Joseph and John return home to look through Stephen\u0027s papers in an attempt to discover who may have wished Stephen harm. They discuss the discovery of Princess Ananka\u0027s tomb and the point when Stephen lost his mind. John reads the story of Princess Ananka\u0027s death from illness on a pilgrimage.In a flashback the body of Princess Ananka [Yvonne Furneaux] is anointed in a ceremony overseen by her high priest Kharis [Christopher Lee]. Her body is taken in a long procession by Kharis to be entombed along with various symbolic relics and statues. Her body is laid to rest in a tomb in the side of a mountain a thousand miles from her home. In various ceremonies over the following days slaves and maidens are sacrificed to ensure the location of the tomb remains a secret. Finally Kharis returns to the tomb alone with the scroll of life. He had secretly been in love with Ananka, which was forbidden for a priest, and tries to bring her back to life by reading the scroll. However, he is caught in the act and sentenced to have his tongue cut out and to remain on guard for eternity at the tomb. He is wrapped in bandages and buried alive in a secret chamber next to Ananka in the tomb.Joseph and John think that Stephen possibly lost his mind over the myths in the story of Ananka and Kharis.At his house Bey offer a prayer to his Egyptian god and instructs the mummy of Kharis to destroy the second of the tomb\u0027s desecrators. As the mummy walks through the woods it is seen by a poacher [Michael Ripper] who flees to a nearby pub. The mummy bursts through the door of Joseph and John\u0027s house and strangles Joseph. John is unable to stop the mummy so runs to get a gun. He fires several shots, hitting the mummy a few times as it leaves but to no effect.Inspector Mulrooney [Eddie Byrne] arrives at the house and John explains that he believes it was a mummy that murdered Joseph, because of Stephen and Joseph\u0027s discovery of Princess Ananka\u0027s tomb. In a flashback, Stephen is shown reading the scroll of life in the tomb and the mummified Kharis coming back to life. As Stephen screams, Bey enters the tomb and orders the mummy back into its burial chamber. Bey leaves with the scroll. Mulrooney does not believe John\u0027s story about the mummy killing Joseph, saying he wants facts. John warns Mulrooney that he may be next to be killed.At the police station, the poacher is brought in and describes to Mulrooney the figure he saw in the woods. Mulrooney also interviews one of the men who transported the crate, and the policeman who searched for the crate in the bog and spoke to Bey.Bey offers another prayer to his god and instructs the mummy to destroy the last of the tomb\u0027s desecrators.At his home John notices that his wife Isobel [Yvonne Furneaux] bears a striking resemblance to a picture of Princess Ananka. John mentions his fears about being attacked by the mummy to Isobel and asks her to remain upstairs where she will be safe. John gets a shotgun ready as the mummy makes its way towards his house. The mummy breaks in through the windows and John shoots it but to no avail. He then impales the mummy with a spear but the mummy still attacks and starts to strangle him. Isobel runs downstairs and when the mummy sees her he stops strangling John. The mummy approaches Isobel calmly because of her resemblance to Princess Ananka, then leaves the house quietly.Mulrooney returns to the house now believing John\u0027s story and asks John about the Egyptian man living in the house near the nursing home. After Mulrooney leaves, John heads towards Bey\u0027s house. Inside the house Bey believes the mummy has killed all three desecrators and orders the mummy to rest before they return home. John arrives at Bey\u0027s house and they exchange courtesies. Bey wonders why archaeologists like John desecrate Egyptian tombs which were meant to be sealed for all time and John explains it is so they can understand history and civilisation. John expresses his opinion that the ancient Egyptians lacked intelligence because they believed in a worthless god and sacrificed people violently. Bey disagrees as it is part of Egyptian culture and suggests John should be punished for his views. John apologises and in the process of leaving notices Bey has the seal to Ananka\u0027s tomb on a table. Bey returns to pray to his god to apologise for his failure and promises that he will ensure the last desecrator will be dead before sunrise.John returns home and he, Isobel and Mulrooney prepare for the arrival of the mummy with loaded guns. Isobel and Mulrooney and a policeman hide in the woods around the house. Bey and the mummy approach through the woods and attack first the poacher, then the policeman, then knock Mulrooney unconscious before entering the house. The mummy attacks John and he fires twice before the mummy starts to strangle him. Isobel runs in and tells the mummy to stop. At first the mummy ignores her, until John instructs her to let her hair down so she more closely resembles Princess Ananka. Bey orders the mummy to kill her but when it refuses he tries to stab her himself. The mummy attacks Bey and Isobel faints. The mummy picks up Isobel and carries her to the bog followed by John, Mulrooney and several men. John calls to Isobel to wake her up and she instructs the mummy to put her down. Once she is free the men open fire and the mummy sinks into the bog water clutching the scroll of life.","numvotes":"9410","primarytitle":"The Mummy"},"color":"rgb(102,84,106)","size":1.0},{"source":"Mystery","target":"tt0060109","id":"6742","attributes":{"productioncompany":"Discobolo Film","countriesoforigin":"Italy","averagerating":"6.5","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"Un angelo per Satana","storyline":"At the end of the 19th century, in a little Italian village by a lake an old statue is recovered.

Weyland tells David that one day they will search for mankind\u0027s creator together. David comments on his own unlimited lifespan compared to his creator\u0027s limited one.In 2104, 11 years after the \u0027Prometheus\u0027 expedition, the colonization ship \u0027Covenant\u0027 is bound for a remote planet, Origae-6, with a crew of 15, two thousand colonists in stasis and 1,140 human embryos aboard. The ship is monitored by Walter, a newer android model that physically resembles David. A stellar burst damages the ship, killing 47 colonists. Walter orders the ship\u0027s computer to wake the crew, which includes several married couples. The ship\u0027s captain, Jake Branson, is burned alive when his stasis pod malfunctions. While repairing the ship, the crew picks up a radio transmission from a nearby, habitable planet. Against the objections of Daniels (Branson\u0027s widow), the new captain, Oram, decides to investigate.As the Covenant remains in orbit, an expedition team descends to the earth-like planet\u0027s surface and tracks the transmission\u0027s signal to a crashed alien ship. Crew members Ledward and Hallett are infected by alien spores. Oram\u0027s wife Karine helps the rapidly-sickening Ledward back to the lander where Maggie, the pilot, quarantines them both inside the med-bay. A small, pale, alien creature (neomorph) bursts from Ledward\u0027s back, killing him, and then kills Karine. Maggie attempts to kill the creature with a shotgun, but triggers an explosion which kills her and destroys the lander. The neomorph escapes while a similar creature bursts from Hallett\u0027s mouth.The neomorphs attack the remaining crew members and kill one. The crew manages to kill a neomorph before David, who survived the \u0027Prometheus\u0027 mission, scares away the other, and leads the crew to a temple in a city full of humanoid (Engineer) corpses. David tells them that upon his and fellow \u0027Prometheus\u0027 survivor Elizabeth Shaw\u0027s arrival at the planet, their ship released a black liquid bio-weapon which annihilated the native population and that Shaw died when the ship crashed in the ensuing chaos. After the crew members tell David of their mission, they attempt to contact the \u0027Covenant\u0027 but are prevented by fierce storms. The surviving neomorph infiltrates the structure and kills crew member Rosenthal. David tries to communicate with the creature, but is horrified when Oram kills it. Oram questions David who reveals that the aliens are a result of his experimenting, with the black liquid (formed from the blood of the first Deacon) and a facehugger egg found in the Engineer city, in an attempt to create a new species even more superior to himself, just as he believes himself superior to the humans that created him, and the humans to be superior to the Engineers. He manipulates Oram into being attacked by an alien facehugger. An alien creature (xenomorph) later erupts from Oram\u0027s chest, killing him.As the others search for Oram and Rosenthal, Walter, who has found Shaw\u0027s dissected corpse, confronts David. David explains that he believes humans are a inferior species and should not be allowed to colonize the galaxy. When Walter disagrees, David disables him, and threatens Daniels. Walter recovers (being a superior model capable of self-repair) and confronts David while Daniels escapes as they fight. A facehugger attacks security chief Lope, but he is later rescued by crew member Cole. The now fully grown Xenomorph appears and kills Cole, while Lope escapes and meets up with Daniels. Pilot Tennessee arrives in another lander to extract Daniels, Lope, and Walter, who claims David has \"expired\". After an encounter outside the ship, they kill the Xenomorph and return to the \u0027Covenant\u0027.The next morning, Daniels and Tennessee find out that another Xenomorph burst from Lope\u0027s chest, killing him, and is loose on the Covenant. It matures, and kills crew members Ricks and his wife Upworth. Tennessee and Daniels lure the creature into the Covenant\u0027s terraforming bay and flush it into space.The \u0027Covenant\u0027 resumes its trip to Origae-6, and the surviving crew re-enters stasis. As Walter puts Daniels under, she realizes that he is in fact David, but is unable to escape her stasis pod before falling asleep. David regurgitates two facehugger embryos and places them in cold storage alongside the human embryos before entering the cargo bay containing the colonists in stasis. He then poses as Walter to record a log stating that all crew members except Daniels and Tennessee were killed by the neutrino blast at the beginning of the film and that the ship is still on course for Origae-6.","numvotes":"272635","primarytitle":"Alien: Covenant","productioncompany":"Twentieth Century Fox","countriesoforigin":"United States, United Kingdom","averagerating":"6.4","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"Alien: Covenant","sex of artist":"male","storyline":"In 2104, almost eleven years after the disastrous expedition to the distant moon, LV-223, in Prometheus (2012), the deep-space colonisation vessel, USCSS Covenant, is on course for the remote planet, Origae-6, with more than 2,000 colonists in cryogenic hibernation to build a new world.

Meanwhile, Sheila goes down to the pond to search for another item on the hunt, and runs into the killer dressed in the bear suit, whom she believes to Benson. After teasing him, she goes into a shed by the pond, where she is killed by the bear suit killer.While Lynn is searching for items on the scavenger hunt, Teddy has sex with Dawn at her house and then returns home. Lynn\u0027s friend Leslie (Lois Robbins) goes to search for an item in the attic of the old chapel, where she is confronted by the killer and murdered. Lynn finds her body posed alongside a Virgin Mary statue stored in the attic. She also sees the bear suit killer walking away, who makes no attempt to harm her.Lynn frantically calls campus security, and the police arrive to the campus along with Officer MacVey where they find the bodies. They are immediately suspicious of Mike Pryor, and question several of the students which lasts most of the night and the following day. After the news reporters have left, Dawn gets into an argument with her boyfriend, who kicks her out of their house after he tells her he knows about her affair with Teddy. As this is occurring, Officer MacVey is studying the phone calls placed to the radio station as well as files and photographs of Dickie Cavanaugh, whose death he has just become aware of by Dickie\u0027s doctor.After Dawn is kicked out of her house, she becomes panicked and senses that someone is following her on the campus. She makes a call from the cafeteria phone to Teddy\u0027s house, where he is consoling Lynn. Teddy leaves Lynn to go get Dawn, and finds her in the cafeteria, severely wounded and covered in blood. The bear mascot suit is nearby.As Teddy is comforting her, he is stabbed by Barney with a kitchen knife. Before she can continue to stab him, Officer MacVey enters the cafeteria and confronts Barney, who he addresses as Katie Cavanaugh, Dickie\u0027s twin sister. Speaking in different voices, she seems to be suffering from multiple personalities, and denies that she is Katie, claiming to be Dickie. When MacVey tells Katie that Dickie had committed suicide two days ago, she shifts back into her usual speaking voice, and confusedly tells him that Dickie is not dead, claiming to have brought him home from the hospital herself. Barney/Katie opens the freezer door, revealing Dickie\u0027s frozen dead body.","numvotes":"1324","primarytitle":"Girls Nite Out"},"color":"rgb(65,97,106)","size":1.0},{"source":"cursed art","target":"tt1341710","id":"6631","attributes":{"productioncompany":"Wesley Clover Media","countriesoforigin":"Canada","averagerating":"5.5","titletype":"movie","notes":"Orientalism or folk horror","originaltitle":"The Shrine","storyline":"After a young American backpacker goes missing in Europe, a group of journalists link his disappearance to a remote village in Poland.

Another man then kills him by smashing his head with a sledgehammer.A journalist, Carmen (Cindy Sampson), is having problems with her relationship with her boyfriend, Marcus (Aaron Ashmore) who is a photographer. Marcus says that although both of them are busy with their respective work, Carmen never seems to stop thinking about it and tends to ignore him.Carmen asks her boss to allow her to to investigate the disappearances of several tourists in the fictional Polish village of Alvania (the letter v is not part of the modern Polish alphabet). The last person to go missing was Eric Taylor (Ben Lewis), the man killed at the beginning of the film. She also mentions that the luggages of all the missing tourists end up being found all around Eastern Europe. Her boss isn\u0027t interested in another missing persons case, saying that people go missing all the time and does not give her permission to go. Instead, he would rather have her investigate why a farmer\u0027s bees go missing.Carmen and her intern Sara (Meghan Heffern) visit Eric\u0027s mother, Laura. Laura tells them that she has tried to get the help of both the Polish and the American Police. However, they are unwilling to help her. Carmen asks Laura if Eric\u0027s luggage has been returned to her. Laura says that it has and Carmen borrows Eric\u0027s journal.Later in her home while reading Eric\u0027s journal, she sees a vision of Eric who has bloody eyes and tells her \"leave me alone\". But this is revealed to be just a dream. Carmen, wanting to mend her relationship with Marcus as well as her job, urges him to come with her and Sara to Alvania. Upon reaching Alvania, they find the village people to be secretive, unfriendly and unwelcoming, just as described in the last entry in Eric\u0027s journal. Although English is taught in the villages\u0027 school, not all the villagers know how to speak it.They find a man (named Henryk) butchering a pig and a girl (named Lidia) picking flowers and approach her. They show her a picture of Eric and ask if she has seen him. The girl is hesitant to answer and before she even can, Henryk (presumably her father) calls to her and sends her off. Carmen, Sara and Marcus explore the village. They notice that the villagers treat their religious leaders like royalty. They then spot a strange dense area of fog which seems to be concentrated only in one portion of the forest, also mentioned in Eric\u0027s notes. They are threatened by Henryk and the villagers and told to leave the village when they attempt to move toward the fog.Leaving the village initially, Carmen tells Marcus that they should go back and investigate the fog. Marcus disagrees and insist that they leave. But Carmen manages to convince Marcus to return. They leave their car and walk into the forest where they eventually find the area with the fog. Marcus takes pictures of the fog. Carmen, Sara and Marcus find it strange that the fog seems to never move and is quite dense, therefore preventing Marcus from taking pictures of anything inside the fog.Sara enters the fog and disappears into it. Carmen and Marcus wait for Sara to return but after awhile, they lose their patience. Marcus insist that they leave but they can\u0027t leave Sara behind. Carmen enters the fog to find Sara. Moments after she enters the fog, Sara somehow gets out and is found by Marcus. Sara appears to be a little scared and unfocused. Carmen seems to have gotten lose in the fog and comes across a statue of a demon holding a heart. Carmen takes a picture of it. As she moves to the side of the statue in order to take another picture, the statue seems to have turned its head to face Carmen. The statue\u0027s eyes bleed and the \u0027heart\u0027 in its hand start to beat. This frightens Carmen. As she backs away from the statue, she find herself out of the fog and is found by Marcus and Sara. Sara and Carmen talk about seeing the statue, both a bit disoriented, also having heard strange whispering voices.As they make their way back to their car, they come arcoss Lidia who claims to know the whereabouts of Eric and takes them to a hidden sacrificial tomb, where they discover the bodies of people (including Eric) whom the village people have executed. Each body has a metal mask deeply embedded on its face, making it look as though the villagers are cultists and are practicing some kind of ritual black magic on the tourists who come to Alvania. Marcus, Sara and Carmen notice that Lidia is gone and finds the door to the tomb jammed.Luckily, Marcus is able to open it but they are suddenly surrounded by the villagers. They struggle to escape but one of the villagers knocks out Carmen. Henryk shoots Sara\u0027s leg with a crossbow. The villagers knock her out with chloroform but not before she sees the one of the villagers\u0027 face turn into a demon. Marcus runs into the forest and is being chased by Henryk. Henryk catches up with him. Marcus fights Henryk but the latter gains the upper hand and knocks him out with chloroform.As they wake up, they see Henryk talking to Lidia. Lidia walks off and the villagers bring them back to the entrance of the sacrificial tomb where the head of the village\u0027s church, Arkadiusz, decides to sacrifice both Sara and Carmen. Sara and Carmen are taken inside the sacrificial tomb while Marcus is led away by two villagers and is forced to dig a grave at gunpoint. After one of them leaves, Marcus uses the shovel to disarm the remaining villager with the gun and knock him unconscious. He takes the gun and runs off to rescue Sara and Carmen.At the sacrificial tomb, Cultists strip Carmen and Sara and don them with ceremonial gowns. Henryk puts on the Cultists\u0027 robes. The Cultists place Sara on the same ceremonial table where Eric was killed while Carmen is placed in a prison cell. The Cultists secure her arms, legs and head. They then deeply lacerate her arms and sever her Achilles\u0027 tendons. While this is being done to her, she sees the faces of the Cultists and Arkadiusz turn into demons. The same mask they found on the corpses is placed over Sara\u0027s head. It has two spikes inside of it which are meant to pierce Sara\u0027s eyes and embed the mask on her face. Arkadiusz takes a sledgehammer and uses it to embed the mask on Sara, executing her in the process.One of the Cultists looks at Carmen and she sees that the Cultist\u0027s face become that of a demon as well. They bring her out to be sacrificed but Marcus rescues her. He locks the Cultists in the tomb and he and Carmen make their escape.They enter a villager\u0027s house to steal the keys to a truck. Marcus sees a woman, Emilia, and her son, Dariusz, in the kitchen. The woman calls for her husband, Aleks, but is unable to do anything since Marcus still has the gun. Marcus asks them for the keys to the truck but they can\u0027t understand English. When they see Carmen, Emilia expresses fear and panic. Marcus takes the family to their living room and ties up the couple.While Marcus tries to get them to give him the keys, Carmen starts to experience voices. She sees the objects in the room shake. She sees Daruisz turn into a demon and gaze at her. She sees Emilia and Aleks untie themselves and crawl on the floor and as demons. Marcus turns around to Carmen and he too becomes a demon. But in truth, all of them are still humanEmilia and Aleks are still tied up and none of them are even looking at her.Carmen goes to another room where she continues to see and hear things. Dariusz, who understands and speaks English, leads Marcus back to the kitchen and gives him the truck keys. Not wanting to risk Dariusz going out and call for help, Marcus also ties him up. The boy begs for Marcus to let them go and warns him that Carmen is evil since she has seen the statue. However, Marcus ignores him. Carmen is then possessed by a demon while she is alone in the room and lets out a very loud shriek. The Cultists, who have gotten free and are looking for Carmen, hear the shriek and are alerted of Carmen\u0027s location.Marcus hears Carmen calling out to him. He enters the room she went inside through a door from the kitchen. As he enters the room, another door leading back to the living room closes. Marcus hears Aleks and Emilia scream in fear and pain, followed by footsteps going to the kitchen. Marcus then hears Dariusz screaming. As he looks out from the door, he sees the boy being dragged on the floor. The door then closed before he could go out and Dariusz\u0027s screaming stops. The door leading to the living room slowly opens. He goes to the living room and finds the entire family brutally killed. A possessed Carmen then jumps on him and pins him on the floor. Just as she is about to kill Marcus, she is confronted by the Cultists. She kills several of them. Arkadiusz fights back with prayers and holy water. He calls for the mask but the Cultist holding the mask is stunned in fear, giving the possessed Carmen the opportunity to impale Arkadiusz. Carmen turns her attention back to Marcus.Before Arkadiusz dies, he passes on his duties to Henryk. Henryk chants prayers while splashing Carmen with holy water. Henryk stabs Carmen. The prayers weaken her, allowing Henryk to slowly set on her on the floor. Two more Cultists help. They impale Carmen\u0027s hands and pin her to the floor, making sure she does not get back up. Henryk calls for the mask and this time, the Cultist holding the mask complies. They position the mask over Carmen\u0027s face while Henryk readies the sledgehammer. However Carmen stills struggles and the mask can\u0027t be properly placed over her eyes.Marcus now realizes what is going on and understands why it was necessary to kill Sara and Carmen. Sara and Carmen saw the statue which is why the villagers decided to kill them but not Marcus. The Cultists weren\u0027t Cultists and they weren\u0027t sacrificing anyone. They were trying to prevent demonic possessions from taking place. Knowing this, Marcus helps out Henryk and the others. He holds Carmen\u0027s head still. With the mask now in place, Henryk readies the sledgehammer to embed the mask. Carmen returns to normal and asks Marcus for help but Marcus knows it is just a trick. Henryk sends the sledgehammer down and embeds the mask on Carmen, killing her.Marcus then looks at Henryk and the remaining men, wondering what will happen to him since he knows too much. One of the villagers asks Henryk on what they will do with Marcus. In the end, Marcus is set free by the villagers. Henryk offers to have one of the village\u0027s men take him to where he needs to go. Marcus looks over to the forest where the fog is seen. Not really knowing what is really inside the fog, he asks Henryk about it. He is told that the fog and the statue are a curse left long ago to the village that cannot be undone. The devillish statue is shown once more and the screen goes black.","numvotes":"13682","primarytitle":"The Shrine"},"color":"rgb(93,99,84)","size":2.0},{"source":"Drama","target":"tt0410730","id":"6912","attributes":{"notes":"Truly weird and disturbing film","runtimeminutes":"91","sex of killer":"male","synopsis":"The focus of Taxidermia is mood, tone and visuals rather than a specific plot narrative. The summary presented here relays the events in the film, but the manner in which they are presented in the film is equally if not more important that the events themselves. This summary should not be considered an adequate substitute for the experience of actually watching the film.Note: Hungarian names in the film and this summary are in \"Eastern order\" (family name first.)Morosgoványi Vendel (Csaba Czene) is a lowly soldier/orderly stationed at a remote Hungarian farmhouse in WWII. The farmhouse is occupied by Lieutenant Balatony Lajoska (Marc Bischoff), his obese wife (Viktória Kiss), and their two teenage daughters. Morosgoványi lives in a crude shed with pigs and spends much time having sexual fantasies about the young girls, typically while spying on them, masturbating or experimenting with his remarkable ability to shoot flames out of the end of his penis.Following the slaughter of one of the hogs, Morosgoványi is propositioned by Mrs. Balatony who pulls Morosgoványi down upon her in the wooden bathtub containing the pig carcass. They have vigorous and loud sex, with Morosgoványi fantasizing that he\u0027s actually screwing the Balatony daughters. Upon finishing, Morosgoványi falls asleep and it is apparent that he was fantasizing the entire encounter while actually copulating with the dead pig.The next morning, Lt. Balatony kicks open the door to the shed, and shoots the slowly awakening Morosgoványi in the back of the head, blowing his brains out. Mrs Balatony subsequently gives birth to a very large, fat baby. The lieutenant examines the boy lying in the wooden bathtub and discovers a pig-like tail on him. Without speaking a word, he retrieves a pair of pliers from the shed, calmly snips off the tail, and slaps the boy on the rump.Thirty years later Balatony Kálmán (Trócsányi Gergõ) still has his tail stump, and has grown into a hefty professional speed eater. In an stadium full of cheering fans, Kálmán and his friend Miszlényi Béla (Koppány Zoltán) compete for Hungary against the Russian team, shoveling huge spoonfuls of offal and other disgusting material into their mouths in an attempt to finish their enormous helpings first.Narrowly losing the initial round, Kálmán is berated by his uncle/coach for being distracted by Aczél Gizi (Stanczel Adél), the women\u0027s speed-eating champion who is present in the audience and cheering for both him and Béla, who also fancies Gizi. During the break between rounds, Kálmán and Béla trade jibes over Gizi while casually regurgitating the meal they have just gorged themselves.After wiping their mouths off, the competitors face up to the next round - chosen by the Russians to be a giant blob of gelatin/fat with various disgusting animal parts congealed within. Still distracted by Gizi, Kálmán suffers an attack of lock-jaw, and - unable to get the spoon out of his mouth - collapses backwards.Béla visits Kálmán, who is recovering in hospital with an enormous scar on his chest, Gizi by his side. Béla and Gizi blatantly flirt yet Kálmán appears not to mind, instead savoring the drop of sweat that falls onto his face from Gizi\u0027s hairy armpit. At his subsequent wedding to Gizi, Kálmán sings a folorn song about unrequited love while Béla convinces Gizi to \"elope\" with him. The \"elopement\" consists of taking her outside and drunkenly screwing her from behind while she looks through the window at her husband.We next see a sports factory where fat young boys are apprenticed to a government program to develop world-class speed eaters. Seated at an enormous trough of semolina, the stern coach blankets the trough with a few scoops of cocoa powder before starting the boys off on their training. In an office above the factory floor Kálmán is in training and is frustrated. Just at the time when he is attempting his professional comeback from injury, the International Olympic Committee has refused to recognize sport eating. While vomiting into a recycling machine, he complains to his coach.Gizi discovers that she is pregnant. Her and Kálmán\u0027s joy is obvious, but they are concerned by the Communist rules which require pregnant women to be reassigned to a particular factory which would negatively affect her calorie intake and thus her competitiveness in sport eating. They bribe the obstetrician, who gives them a choice between \"cyst\" and \"myeoma\" as a diagnosis which will apparently enable special treatment.While on holidays at the seaside, the famous Kálmán and Gizi are playfully suggesting names for their child when they are \"invited\" aboard the yacht of a visiting Russian dignitary. Before boarding, a flunky explains that they are expected to give a demonstration of their sport. Specifically, this involves eating 45kg of caviar (with a few bacon hocks thrown in) within 20 minutes. Gizi clearly struggles, perhaps concerned for the baby. Beneath decks, Kálmán supports her by reminding her of her previous glories. Back upstairs they are expected to attend dinner, but Gizi is so sick that she passes out face-first onto her plate.Another thirty years pass. We see Balatony Lajoska (Marc Bischoff), - painfully thin - at work at his taxidermy business. Cluttered throughout with various animals, the workshop shows a man who is dedicated to his work. Lajoska leaves his shop and travels to the grocery store where he purchases a huge volume of butter and chocolate. He is obviously smitten by the checkout girl, who ignores his creepy attempts at making eye contact. Lajoska visits the apartment of his father Kálmán, who is now a ridiculously immense naked blob of shapeless flesh. The chocolate bars are for Kálmán, who boasts that by leaving the silver wrappers on he can increase his intake from 400 to 570 per hour. The butter is for Kálmán\u0027s super-sized cats, who lurk menacingly behind iron bars in their porcelain-tiled lair.Kálmán clearly despises his son, partly because of his profession (\"carcass stuffer\") but mostly because he is so skinny. Lajoska endures a barrage of insults from his father as he cleans the house and the cage. Kálmán is too fat to move and even needs his son to change his bedpan for him. Kálmán\u0027s life revolves around his enormous cats and his television, which he swears at while watching his former wife Gizi coaching an American champion speed eater.Back at his taxidermy shop, Lajoska is asked by a dapper businessman for his help regarding a special project. \"Domestic or wild?\" The businessman smirks and admits \"Domestic\". Peering into the customer\u0027s paper bag, Lajoska nods and accepts the work.Again at the grocery store, the same shopping list and the same uncomfortable stare at the checkout. At Kálmán\u0027s apartment, his father needles Lajoska with continued insults. When he calls his son \"cyst\", Lajoska angrily confronts him about how ungrateful he has been. The two get into a terrible argument, throwing chocolate bars at each other. Lajoska storms out suddenly, telling his father he can die for all he cares.Lajoska throws himself into his work. We see extreme closeups of his work under a magnifying class as he prepares various animals for mounting. Back at the grocery store a few days later, Lajoska is buying a small amount of butter and chocolate; the fight with his father was probably the latest in a long series. The female clerk is gone, replaced by a man.At Kálmán\u0027s apartment, Lajoska realizes something is wrong. Having left the cage open after their terrible fight, the cats have attacked and killed Kálmán, chewing a hole into his enormous gut. A string of entrails leads back into the cage where a pair of satisfied cats sit licking their chops.Lajoska embalms his father, stuffing straw into his stomach through the holes the cats gnawed. We next see him strapped standing into an elaborate contraption in the basement of his workshop. Pumps slowly sigh, liquid flows through clear tubes, syringes dive into flesh, and trays of scalpels and other vicious medical instruments move past on articulated arms.With the aid of mirrors, clamps and levers, Lajoska begins the exacting and painstaking work of eviscerating himself. There is no doubt as to his intentions and progress; we are shown in exacting detail scalpels slicing flesh, opening body cavities, removing organs. Lajoska guts himself in front of us.With trembling hands, obviously exhausted from his work, Lajoska finally sews up his own sweating torso. Completing the taxidermy, he pushes a button and we see a razor-sharp blade crank slowly around to the front his neck. After a few calm breaths, the blade is released and via a spring it whips around behind, decapitating Lajoska. A moment later, a saw falls on his right arm, blood gushing as it\u0027s severed just below the shoulder.We cut to the businessman returning to the shop. Unable to locate the proprietor, he goes into the back room and discovers, in the same paper bag, the completed work he requested of Lajoska: a glass globe containing a tiny human fetus. Satisfied, he is about to leave a stack of cash on the bench, when he changes his mind. Venturing further into the shop, he eventually makes his way down to the basement where he discovers Lajoska.We cut immediately to the same businessman at an avant-garde art gallery, lauding the artistic genius of Balatony Lajoska. The glitterati are drinking champagne and eating hors dourves from a porcelain pig.On display in the gallery are two exhibits: firstly: Balatony Kálmán, resplendent in golden tights with a snarl of cat fur protruding from the hole in his magnificent belly, but primarily Balatony Lajoska - minus his head and right arm, standing casually naked with a stitched torso, looking more like a classical Greek statue than a man who mutilated himself.","numvotes":"17441","primarytitle":"Taxidermia","productioncompany":"Amour Fou Vienna","countriesoforigin":"Hungary, Austria, France","averagerating":"6.8","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"Taxidermia","sex of artist":"male","storyline":"Three generations of men, including a pervert that constantly seeks for new kinds of satisfaction, an obese speed eater and a passionate embalmer.","startyear":"2006","role of artist":"killer"},"color":"rgb(117,90,85)","size":3.0},{"source":"Action","target":"tt0146675","id":"7104","attributes":{"productioncompany":"Beacon Communications","countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"5.8","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"End of Days","storyline":"On December 28th, 1999, the citizens of New York City are getting ready for the turn of the millennium.

If he bears her child between 11:00 PM and midnight on New Year\u0027s Eve, the world will end, and the only hope lies within an atheist ex-cop named Jericho Cane, who no longer believes in God because of the murder of his wife and daughter. —Ridley Lavine","startyear":"1999","runtimeminutes":"122","synopsis":"Jericho Cane (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a mercenary who is in the throes of deep depression. He gets an assignment to protect an investment banker, and is shot by a crazed priest () in the process. From this priest Jericho gets the name Christine York (), a young woman living in New York.Jericho finds Christine and rescues her from a group of Catholic assassins. It turns out that Christine has been chosen to bear Satan\u0027s child on New Year\u0027s Eve, 1999, a date that is rapidly approaching. Jericho and Christine escape to a church where Father Kovak (Rod Steiger) knows what is going on. Christine stays with the faith-filled Christians while Jericho scoffs at their faith and leaves.Jericho is visited by Satan (), who wants the location of the girl. It turns out that Jericho had a wife and daughter, but they were murdered by gangsters to get revenge on Jericho, who was a cop. Satan mocks God and promises to bring Jericho\u0027s family back to life if Jericho helps. Jericho tells Satan to \"Go to hell,\" and throws him out of a window.Later, Satan tricks Jericho into leading him to Christine. Christine is taken by Satan and his followers, with Jericho beaten and left for dead. After waking, Jericho loads up on guns and ammo and interrupts Satan\u0027s impregnation ceremony. Jericho and Christine flee as Jericho pumps hundreds of rounds and grenades into Satan.The battle takes them to a church. Satan\u0027s assumed body has been destroyed, so he possesses Jericho. Satan (in Jericho\u0027s body) is about to rape Christine, but Jericho resists and kills himself. New Year\u0027s Eve passes, and Satan is defeated. Before dying, Jericho sees the ghost of his wife and daughter, thanking him for doing the right thing.********************************************************************************************************************In 1979, a newborn girl named Christine York is identified by Satanists including her physician, Dr. Abel, and her guardian, Mabel as the one chosen to bear Satan\u0027s son during the last hour on New Year\u0027s Eve, 1999, due to a symbol on her arm. As she is being born, a priest in the Vatican witnesses a comet arching over the moon, described as the \"Eye of God\", heralding the birth of the one chosen to be the mother of Satan\u0027s child. The priest is then sent on a mission by the Pope to find and protect the girl from Satan\u0027s presence at all costs. However, a few Vatican Knights (led by a corrupted cardinal) insist that she must be killed to prevent Satan\u0027s plans, which most of the clergy (including the Pope) opposes, as they view that taking a life in an attempt to stop evil is sinful.Twenty years later, near the end of 1999, retired cop Jericho Cane, in a constant state of depression since his wife and daughter were murdered by hit-men, works for an elite security and protection company. He and his co-worker/friend Bobby Chicago are assigned to protect a Wall Street banker. They are attacked by a priest named Thomas Aquinas, who is eventually captured and taken to a hospital. Unknown to Jericho, Aquinas somehow knew the real identity of the banker - he has been possessed by Satan and now wields great powers. Satan locates Aquinas and brutally murders him, crucifying him onto a ceiling. Jericho and Chicago see a name amongst many other things scratched into Aquinas\u0027s skin, and after some guesswork, begin searching for Christine York.Jericho and Chicago find the now-adult York in her apartment and save her from the Vatican Knights who attempt to assassinate her. That evening, Chicago waits in a van while Jericho discusses the recent happenings with Christine. Satan arrives and blows up the van, killing Chicago. As Jericho and Christine try to flee, they are apprehended by Mabel who is possessed with preternatural strength despite her late middle age and lesser size. Jericho barely manages to subdue her. Outside, Marge, Jericho\u0027s superior from his days in the police force, and another police officer, both Satanists, confront him, demanding Christine. Jericho kills them both. A few moments later Satan resurrects Marge for her usefulness as a NYPD detective to have the police search for Jericho and Christine, who have escaped to a nearby church, seeking answers from a priest, Father Kovak.Kovak soon realizes Christine and the banker\u0027s roles, and describes how at the end of every millennium, Satan will possess a man\u0027s body to consummate with the flesh of a preordained woman. If he succeeds in taking York, he will have free rein over the world. After hearing that the only way to defeat Satan is to \"have faith\", Jericho tries to persuade Christine to go into hiding with him, but she prefers to stay with Kovak after he says that Satan\u0027s greatest trick was to fool Mankind that he did not exist and she felt Kovak\u0027s explanation was true. Frustrated, Jericho returns to his apartment, and it is there that Satan meets with him and tries to tempt him with his lost family and his anger at God in order to make him reveal Christine\u0027s location. Jericho resists and manages to throw Satan out of his apartment window. Chicago soon shows up, alive and well. Despite Jericho\u0027s initial suspicion, they make a plan to retrieve Christine.At the church, where Kovak and his clergy inform the Pope of York\u0027s location, he orders them to hide and protect her at all costs. Unfortunately, the Vatican Knights arrive again, taking Kovak and his clergy into custody while they try to kill Christine again. Before they manage to do so, however, Jericho comes by and stops them, saving Christine and the clergy. Satan then appears, and Jericho runs away safely with Christine. The clergymen, in an act of bravery, confront Satan and try to send him back to Hell by using exorcism, but he resists them with impunity, killing the Vatican Knights, including the misguided cardinal. As Jericho and Christine arrive outside, Chicago then betrays the two; he leaves with Christine while Jericho is beaten by a mob of Satanists and left for dead. The next morning, Jericho is found and rescued by Kovak. Jericho immediately arms himself heavily to resume his search for Christine. He notices the resurrected Marge and follows her to Satan\u0027s hidden temple. There, he manages to rescue Christine and kill Marge for the second time. Chicago steps in to stop Jericho, revealing that Satan resurrected him in exchange for his help in capturing Christine. He manages to fight off Satan\u0027s influence after some persuasion by his friend; in retaliation, Satan burns him alive. Enraged, Jericho opens fire on Satan and escapes with Christine in the ensuing chaos.The two make their way through Satan\u0027s hideout and into a subway tunnel. They board a train and attempt to escape. Satan catches up with them and kills the motorman. In the ensuing fight, Jericho fires an M203 grenade launcher at Satan, wrecking the train and buying them enough time to escape. The banker\u0027s body is now irreparably damaged and so Satan leaves it to find a new host.Jericho and Christine escape to the streets and into another church where he prays to God. Satan smashes through the floor and confronts Jericho in his true form: a massive, demonic creature. He enters Jericho\u0027s body and possesses him. Now controlled by Satan, Jericho attempts to rape Christine, but with the help of her begging words, he is able to fight Satan\u0027s control for a few seconds. Using what may be his only opportunity to redeem himself, Jericho impales himself on the sword protruding from a fallen statue of Saint Michael The Archangel, thus disabling his body for the few remaining seconds before midnight.

When another nun tries to get her to come down, Maureen accidentally pushes her over the railing to her death. Another nun tells Maureen that she will burn in hell for what she did. She is forced to leave the convent after this ordeal.She walks through the desert for a while, and finally reaches a highway. A beat-up car approaches and passes her, but backs up upon seeing her. The driver, Duane Duke (Jeff Fahey) offers her a ride. She puts her suitcase in the backseat and in doing so, bumps his guitar. He tells her to be careful with it, because it is his \"bread and butter\"--he is on his way to Los Angeles to make it big as a rock-n\u0027-roll singer. She says that she\u0027s having car problems, and that the problem is that there is no car.They continue driving into the night during a heavy rainstorm. Duane can barely see ahead of him but keeps on driving aggressively, and the car begins to weave between the lanes. The car is having engine problems, and a loud popping sound causes Duane to swerve the car to the other side of the road. Duane pulls the car off the road, and tells Maureen that they aren\u0027t going any further, due to the storm. He advises her to try to get some sleep. During the middle of the night, it is still raining, and Duane makes a pass at her. She struggles to fight him off, and slaps his face. She gets out of the car, and he angrily tosses her suitcase out into a muddy puddle. Duane drives off, leaving Maureen sobbing.The next morning at the Bates Motel, Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) collects some dead birds in a paper sack from the ground, thanks to some poisoned birdseed he kept in a birdfeeder, and stuffs them in the kitchen using his taxidermy supplies. On the table is a newspaper opened up to an article entitled, \"Spool Still Missing.\" Norman has a flashback of him killing Emma Spool (Claudia Bryar, from the end of Psycho II), and when he looks down at the bird he is stitching up, he instead sees a hand and arm being stitched together! He is startled when the paper sack moves along the tabletop by itself, and is relieved to see a healthy bird pop out. Norman carefully grasps the bird in his hands and releases it outside. He hears a car horn blaring, and comes down to meet Duane. Duane is interested in the \"help wanted\" sign posted on the office window. Norman offers him a job as an assistant manager for the motel, and Duane accepts, mentioning that he only wants to stay long enough to earn money to fix his car to go to L.A.Norman goes off to the diner (Statlers) where he used to work to get some food. At the diner, Ralph Statler (Robert Alan Browne)--the owner--is having a conversation with Sheriff John Hunt (Hugh Gillin) about Emma Spool. He is confused as to why she would suddenly not show up for work a month ago and disappear, after normally being a stellar employee since he took over the diner from the previous owner, Harvey Leach (Hugo L. Stanger) seven years earlier. --Sheriff Hunt says that her apartment has been searched and nothing seems out of the ordinary. Ralph hopes that nothing serious has happened to her, displaying a worried look on his face. Tracy Veneble (Roberta Maxwell), a nosy magazine reporter, chimes in and suggests that Norman may have had something to do with her disappearance. She came from L.A. to interview Norman about the subject of the insanity defense and the rehabilitation of mentally ill murderers.Sheriff Hunt and Ralph argue with her and tell her to leave him alone in peace. Just then, Norman walks in and sits down in a booth. He orders a meal and gets an order of burgers to go. Tracy sits down across from him and starts to ask him some questions. He opens up to her and explains that what happened to him in the past stays with him and he can\u0027t escape the reality of what he did. As they are talking, Maureen gets out of a semi truck and comes into the diner. Norman is horrified to see her initials on her suitcase--\"M.C.\" Norman has a flashback to the murder of Marion Crane from 22 years earlier-he notices that Maureen is almost an exact look-alike to Marion. He pays for the food and quickly leaves while Tracy keeps droning on and on.Back at the motel, Duane sees an exhausted Maureen walking toward the highway. He apologizes to her for his behavior the night before (he says he was road-weary) and offers her a motel room that she can rest in. She pays him $25 for the room, and he gives her the key to cabin #1. As she leaves, Duane keeps the $5 bill she gave him, folds over the edge of one corner, and puts it in his pocket. Norman walks by and sees her going into the room. He freaks out and goes back to the house. Norman has a conversation with \"Mother (Virginia Gregg\u0027s voice),\" the stuffed corpse of Mrs. Spool. He tells \"her\" about Maureen resembling Marion, and \"she\" tells him to get rid of her if her presence upsets him. He refuses, and Mother says that maybe she will do it instead.Maureen unpacks her suitcase in cabin 1. She sees a copy of the Bible on the nightstand, and she has a traumatic memory of her actions at the convent. She starts to cry. In Fairvale, Duane goes into a bar and sees Tracy Veneble. He introduces himself to her and lights her cigarette for her. She initially is turned off by him, but when she sees his Bates Motel matchbook, she decides to have a talk with him.In the motel office parlor, Norman takes a picture off the wall, and looks through a peephole into cabin 1. He sees Maureen stripping and going into the bathroom nude. Norman goes back up to the house and puts on his \"Mother\" costume and goes back to cabin 1 to kill her. Maureen is in the shower, and \"Mother\" pulls back the shower curtain. Maureen is sitting in a tub of rising bloody water. A razor blade sits nearby. She lifts up her hands to reveal that her wrists were slit, with blood gushing out of the wounds. Due to her blood loss, Maureen hallucinates that \"Mother\" is the Virgin Mary coming to save her.Meanwhile, Duane and Tracy continue talking about Norman. Tracy says she will pay Duane for any information he gives her. Unexpectedly, she gets up and leaves. Duane notices a red-haired girl (Juliette Cummins) staring at him.At St. Matthew\u0027s Hospital, Maureen is in a room recovering from her suicide attempt. Father Brian (Gary Bayer), a psychiatrist, is sitting by her bedside and introduces himself to her. Outside her room, Norman and Sheriff Hunt are waiting. Tracy shows up and claims that she happened to be passing by the motel and saw the ambulance leaving and decided to follow it. She asks how Norman found out about Maureen. Sheriff Hunt chimes in and says he was bringing fresh towels to Maureen\u0027s motel room when he found her in the bathtub after she cut her wrists and he used her room phone to call for an ambulance, repeating what Norman had told him. Father Brian comes out and tells Norman that Maureen wants to see him.Maureen thanks Norman for finding her and calling for help. He is just glad that he was looking out for someone else. He tells her that she can stay at the motel for free as long as she wants until she gets better and can sort her life out. He leaves her room to let her rest, and goes back home. He accuses Mother of hurting Maureen, and says that he is glad that Maureen didn\u0027t die. Mother replies, \"She will!\"Duane brings the red-haired girl back to the motel. They overhear Norman yelling at Mother. They just assume the noise is due to a loud TV. Red tries to open the ice chest next to the office to get some ice, but it is locked. She bumps into Norman and falls to the ground. He opens the chest for her and she gets some ice and asks him to join her and Duane; he politely declines.Red and Duane make love, and later she comes out of the shower. She goes over to Duane to kiss some more and he isn\u0027t interested anymore. She is upset because she wants this relationship to be more than just a one-night fling, and he tells her to leave and gives her $5 for cab fare, the same $5 that Maureen used to help pay for cabin #1. He tosses her and her clothes out the door. She puts her clothes on and goes into to a phone booth nearby to call for a cab. She realizes she put her shirt on backward and takes it off to put it back on correctly. Suddenly, Mother\u0027s hand bursts through the glass door, opens it, and stabs her over and over again. Red struggles to fight off Mother\u0027s attack, and she severely cuts the bottoms of her bare feet from stumbling on the glass shards on the floor, blood squishing out. Red crumples to the ground and Mother turns around and leaves. Back at the house, Norman cries, \"Mother! Oh God, Mother! Blood! Blood!\"The next morning, Duane comes out of his cabin and sees Norman scrubbing the glass walls of the phone booth with soapy water. Duane goes into the office and sees that the $5 bill he gave Red for cab fare is in the cash drawer.At the hospital, Maureen is having a counseling session with Father Brian. She tells him that it was her idea to become a nun, but that as the time grew close to take her final vows of celibacy, she became scared and was dwelling on lustful thoughts. Father Brian asks her why she didn\u0027t just leave the novitiate, rather than be tormented by those thoughts.Duane talks to Tracy at the motel about the $5 bill he discovered in the drawer. She tells him it may have helped solve the mystery if he knew the girl\u0027s name. The motel is bustling with activity because Fairvale\u0027s homecoming football game is later in the day, and several guests have checked into rooms. Norman and Maureen arrive in a cab, and he sees Tracy going up to the house. She wants to continue her interview with him, but he stops her and tells her to leave and never come back. Norman goes into cabin 1, and Maureen is pleased to find that Norman had her wet clothes sent to the dry-cleaner\u0027s. He tells her that she\u0027ll look good in her pink dress on their dinner date later on.At Mrs. Spool\u0027s apartment, Tracy talks with the landlord. He says that other than coming and going for work, Mrs. Spool stayed home. The landlord leaves, and Tracy decides to stay and snoop for a while. She glances at some magazines on a coffee table and a single phone number is written on the covers several times. She dials the number on the phone, and she discovers that it connects her to the Bates Motel.That evening, Norman takes Maureen out to eat at a fancy restaurant in Fairview. After eating, they get up to dance. At first, Maureen doesn\u0027t feel comfortable, but Norman teaches her the basic \"box\" step movements.Back at the motel, a cab drops Maureen and Norman off. Maureen goes into her room, and Norman follows soon after. He sees her staring toward the house. He asks her what is wrong, and she says that she must have had too much to drink--she thought she saw a woman up in the window at the house. Uncomfortable, Norman goes to tell Duane that he can take off for the night, and then goes back to Maureen. She tells him she enjoyed her time with him earlier. They lay down on the bed and kiss. Norman stops kissing her, and he says he doesn\u0027t feel right about this. Maureen eases his discomfort by suggesting they just lie on the bed and hold each other.Later that night, Maureen is asleep and Norman is gone. Patsy Boyle (Katt Shea Reuben), a guest from another cabin, comes in to wake her and warns her about the door being left wide open. She tells Maureen that she\u0027ll close it for her, in case one of her drunk friends might happen to wander inside.Up at the house, Mother scolds Norman for letting Maureen come between them. She starts whispering something to him, and he is about to put on the dress and wig. Maureen comes up to the front door and calls out his name. Mother tells him to bring her the knife. He is shocked to see her dead body sit up in bed. Norman takes the knife in his hand, wraps his fingers around the blade, and slams his hand down on a table. He yelps in pain. Concerned, Maureen asks what is wrong. He feigns ill, and tells her to go back to her cabin and lock her door. Soon after, Norman leaves, dressed to kill.Meanwhile, Patsy Boyle is looking for a bathroom to use. She sees the one in the parlor, and sits down on the toilet to relieve herself. Suddenly, she looks up in surprise and sees Mother standing directly in front of her. She tells Mother that the bathroom is \"occupied,\" and Mother thrusts the knife, slitting her throat, and stabbing her in the stomach. Patsy keels over and falls to the floor. Later, Norman goes into the parlor looking for Duane, and he recoils in shock from seeing the bloody mess. Norman takes her body out of the bathroom and tosses it out the window behind the motel. Some partiers are chasing each other around the building, and Norman hides himself and the body momentarily. The guests all get into their cars and leave, burning rubber on their way out to the highway.The next morning, Maureen comes out of her cabin to see the sheriff\u0027s car outside. Worried, she asks about Norman. Tracy is there too, and she decides it\u0027s time to tell Maureen the truth about Norman. Sheriff Hunt and Deputy Leo (Steve Guevara) are investigating the disappearance of Patsy Boyle. She didn\u0027t ride home with the other revelers, and they go up to the house where they question Norman about it. Norman figures that Tracy assumed he was involved. Deputy Leo searches the first floor level, and then goes to search upstairs. Terrified that they\u0027ll discover Mrs. Spool\u0027s corpse, Norman runs up after him, with Sheriff Hunt in pursuit. Norman sees that there is no body in Mother\u0027s room. Bewildered by Norman\u0027s antics, Hunt and Leo leave.Shortly after, Norman is sitting by the ice machine by the motel. Sheriff Hunt apologizes to Norman for their intrusion, and he opens the ice chest to grab a couple of ice cubes to suck on. There are human fingers sticking up out of the ice, but he doesn\u0027t see them. He puts bloody ice cubes in his mouth (he doesn\u0027t notice this-he grabs them without looking at them) and vehemently ignores Tracy\u0027s pleas to take Norman in for questioning about the disappearances of Mrs. Spool and Patsy, because there is no proof that he did anything. Maureen lies to Hunt, and claims that she was with Norman until 6:00 that morning, so he couldn\u0027t have done anything wrong. Hunt and Leo leave, and Tracy waits for Maureen to get in her car--she told her everything about Norman, and Maureen tells a disappointed Norman that she\u0027ll stay with Father Brian for a while. They drive off.Norman looks around the house looking for Mother. She is nowhere to be found. In the kitchen, he sees a note from Mother: \"Norman--I\u0027m in cabin 12. Come see me.\" Norman walks along the front of the motel and approaches cabin 12, which is Duane\u0027s cabin. On the TV is a Woody Woodpecker cartoon. Mother is sitting in front of the TV. On the bed, Duane--high on drugs and alcohol--plays his guitar.\"What are you doing with my mother?\" Norman asks him.Duane replies, \"Don\u0027t you mean, Mummy?\" in a mocking tone. Norman asks him why he took her and left the note for him to find.\"I\u0027m just looking out for you Norman,\" says Duane.\"And yourself,\" Norman says.Duane continues, \"I have ambitions--dreams, but dreams don\u0027t come cheap these days. I could\u0027ve turned \u0027mom\u0027 over to the cops this afternoon, but all I would\u0027ve gotten was a pat on the back for doing my civic duty.\" He tells her that Tracy would\u0027ve payed him a big sum of money, but figures that she would lie and take all the credit and earn a big salary and earn a news position somewhere.Duane blackmails Norman into selling the house and motel in order to give Mother over to Norman. Norman tells him that he wants Mother back. Duane tells him he can take her--Duane says, \"You know what I want, and you know what I\u0027ll do if I don\u0027t get it.\"Norman hits Duane in the head with an ashtray. A violent fight breaks out with Norman hitting Duane with a lamp, and ultimately, hitting Duane with his own guitar. \"Watch the guitar,\" Duane mumbles. Norman hits him with the guitar repeatedly, until the guitar is broken into several pieces. Duane crumples to the floor, unconscious.At the diner, Ralph, Myrna (Lee Garlington)--a waitress, and Tracy are discussing Mrs. Spool. Ralph tells Tracy that Mrs. Spool was a good employee, and was already working there when Ralph bought the place. Tracy asks about the diner\u0027s former owner, Harvey Leach, in the hopes that she can find out more about Mrs. Spool from him. Myrna says that Harvey is in a nursing home outside of town. Tracy visits Harvey, and she asks him about Mrs. Spool. He tells her that Emma had been put in an asylum for killing someone.At Father Brian\u0027s office, Maureen has decided to forgive Norman and wants to be back with him. She has failed other people before, but she won\u0027t fail him.At a library, Tracy looks through old archived newspaper articles, and is shocked to see a headline reading: \"Sister arrested in Bates Murder-Kidnapping.\" Below it is a sub-heading: \"Child Unharmed in Love Triangle Tragedy.\"In Duane\u0027s motel room, Norman removes his belongings and wraps his body in the shower curtain. \"I\u0027ll be back for you mother,\" Norman says. Norman opens the ice chest and tries to remove Patsy\u0027s body from it. One of her arms is wedged against the top of the chest and won\u0027t move, and Norman tries with all his strength to pull it loose, but the arm snaps off. He finally gets the body out of the ice chest, and he kisses her on the lips before putting her in the trunk of Duane\u0027s car. Norman puts Duane\u0027s body in the back seat of the car and drives it over to the swamp. On the way, Duane wakes up and wraps a cord around Norman\u0027s neck. Startled, Norman slams his foot down on the brake pedal and the momentum causes Duane to lurch forward into the front passenger seat.Norman pins Duane down on the floor of the car with his foot, and the other foot accidentally presses down on the gas pedal, sending the car into the swamp. As the car fills with water, Norman sees Duane drowning. Norman manages to escape the flooding car and swims away from it. He struggles to see in the murky water, navigating through underwater weeds. He lets out a scream when he sees Red\u0027s body--her pale, expressionless face staring back at him. He surfaces, and crawls his way out of the swamp.Meanwhile, Tracy shows copies of the newspaper articles to Father Brian, hoping that if Maureen would see them, she could change her story to the police. He tells her Maureen already left and went back to the motel.In her room, Maureen has showered and put on a nightgown. She hears Norman running up the steps to the house, and she calls out to him. He ignores her and runs into the house. She walks up to the house and enters it. As she walks up the staircase, she calls out to Norman again and explains that she has returned. She says that she never should have left and she forgives him for what happened to him in the past, and emphasizes that he saved her life. Norman appears at the top of the stairs. She asks him what happened. He lies and says that he slipped in the mud.She says that she regrets hurting him by leaving, and asks for his forgiveness. They hold each other\u0027s hands and have a brief tender moment. Suddenly, Mother yells, \"Norman!\" Surprised by this, Norman lets go of Maureen\u0027s hands, sending her falling backward down the stairs, arms flailing. At the bottom of the stairs, her skull is pierced by the arrow of the cupid statue against the wall. She crumples to the floor... dead. Norman, in shock, runs down the stairs and sees that blood is pooling around her head. He angrily yells \"Mother!!\" at the top of his lungs.Tracy drives up to the motel, and, carrying a tire iron, checks Maureen\u0027s cabin. She overhears Mother saying to Norman, \"You get that whore out of my house. Throw it out in the muck and filth where she belongs!\" Norman says, \"I\u0027ll get you for this, Mother.\" Mother replies back, \"You haven\u0027t got the guts, boy!\"Tracy goes up to the house and tries to open the front door, but it\u0027s locked. She goes around the back and enters the kitchen. She slowly walks through the hallway into the foyer, and sees the living room lit up with dozens of candles. She sees Maureen\u0027s body laying on the couch, with a lit candle positioned in her grasped hands. With pity, she says, \"You dumb, stupid naive girl.\" She turns around and is shocked to see Norman dressed up as Mother, his mouth fixed in a wide, skeletal smile. \"Why can\u0027t you leave my poor son, my Norman, alone?\" says Mother. Tracy drops the tire iron and tries to escape from him. She begins to go up the stairs, with Norman slowly in pursuit.\"What set you off again, Norman? Was it Mrs. Spool? You killed her, didn\u0027t you? What did she do--come to you and tell you she was your mother? She was crazy, Norman--she wasn\u0027t your mother, and neither are you!\" She reaches the tops of the stairs, Norman still following her. \"Mrs. Spool was your aunt, Norman. She was in love with your father, but your mother stole him away from her! Emma Spool killed your father in a jealous rage and kidnapped you when you were just a baby!\" In Mother\u0027s room, she turns around and lets out a horrified shriek when she sees Mrs. Spool\u0027s corpse sitting in a chair. \"She killed your father because she thought you were her child--the child she should have had with him! She was crazy--they locked her away!\"Mother says, \"It\u0027s lies! It\u0027s all lies! She\u0027s a lying whore. She\u0027s a slut! Don\u0027t let her talk about me like that!\" Norman, seemingly free of Mother\u0027s spell, takes off the wig and dress. \"Get her boy, get her! Just like all the others!\" continues Mother. Norman raises the knife, and it looks as though he is going to attack Tracy, but instead, Norman stabs Mrs. Spool\u0027s body at the neck. \"Norman! Can\u0027t you do anything right?\" says Mother. Norman continues hacking at the neck, with sawdust spraying out. \"How dare you treat your mother that way!\" The corpse slides out of the chair and onto the floor. Norman hacks with the knife until the head is completely severed and rolls to the side. \"So I don\u0027t have the guts, huh?\" taunts Norman. Exhausted, Norman rests his head on the chair.The next morning, Sheriff Hunt leads Norman away from the house in handcuffs. A TV news crew is there filming. Tracy and Father Brian are both in shock. Hunt is in total disbelief with Norman, telling him that he believed in him and had faith in him and now that Norman, as \"Mother\" killed more people. He puts Norman in the back of the squad car, and tells him, \"You\u0027ll never get out again! They\u0027ll lock you up forever!\" In response, Norman replies, \"But I\u0027ll be free. I\u0027ll finally be free.\"As the squad car drives along the highway, Norman reaches into his jacket pocket and pulls out a victory trophy: the severed rotting hand of Mrs. Spool. He gently caresses it as he smiles as the image fades to black.","numvotes":"14400","primarytitle":"Psycho III"},"color":"rgb(65,97,106)","size":1.0},{"source":"comes to life","target":"tt0462326","id":"6657","attributes":{"productioncompany":"Lia Scott Price Productions Inc.","countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"4.2","titletype":"movie","notes":"Adaptation","originaltitle":"The Guardian","storyline":"Adapted from Lia Scott Price\u0027s Horror Novel \"The Guardian\", a Serial Killer Guardian Angel is invoked by college students praying to a cursed Guardian Angel Statue.","startyear":"2006","runtimeminutes":"90","sex of killer":"unhuman","numvotes":"26","primarytitle":"The Guardian"},"color":"rgb(93,99,84)","size":2.0},{"source":"other","target":"tt0055115","id":"7213","attributes":{"productioncompany":"Ambrosiana Cinematografica","countriesoforigin":"Italy","averagerating":"5.7","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"Maciste contro il vampiro","storyline":"(Contains spoilers) Raiders, attacking the village of Goliath and young Ciro, transport Goliath\u0027s girlfriend, Guja, to the island of Salmanak.

Confederate troops led by a man named Jasper (Jack Huston) bring in a few runaway slaves. One of them, Amara (Achok Majak), runs away again in terror after watching the other men strap a device to another slave, Eli (Tongayi Chirisa). Jasper chases after Amara on horseback and brings her down by lassoing a noose around her neck. She begs to be killed instead of returned to the antebellum, and Jasper obliges her by shooting her in the head.One of the captured women, Eden (Janelle Monae), is brought into the home of her owner, a Confederate general known only as \"Him\" (Eric Lange). He beats Eden and orders her to say her name. When she cannot, Him grabs a branding iron and burns it into her back, causing her to scream in agony before weakly crying out her name.Six weeks later, a new group of black people are brought in to the plantation. Jasper orders the group to not speak unless they are given permission. Jasper\u0027s wife Elizabeth (Jena Malone) brings her daughter (Arabella Landrum) to pick one of the women in the group, whom the little girl names Julia (Kiersey Clemons).

She walks carefully across the floor to see which boards do not make noises when stepped on. Julia then goes to her home, where she seems to already know who Eden really is. She wants to try and escape as well, as she is pregnant, but Eden shows her the branding scar to show that it is better not to anger the people in charge. Julia expresses disappointment in Eden, saying she is not a leader.The slaves are forced to work during a gathering of Him and his troops, where he boasts about preserving their way of life for the future. Two young soldiers, Purcell (T.C. Matherne) and Daniel (Robert Aramayo), observe Julia, and Daniel expresses attraction toward her. Purcell encourages him to speak to her, and Jasper comes in and orders Julia to wait in Daniel\u0027s cabin. When Daniel goes to find her later, Julia tries to appeal to what she thinks is his innocent nature since he appeared to be kinder than the other men, but he proves to be just as terrible when he strikes Julia for speaking to him without permission. He kicks her in the stomach before leaving.The next day on the plantation, Julia suffers a miscarriage. She cries out in pain and distress, and Eden goes to help her. Jasper attempts to antagonize them, but Eli keeps him back briefly by calling him a cracker. After letting Eden help Julia, Jasper confronts Eli over the matter, with the other soldiers getting ready to fire if they need to, but he instead sends Eli to clean out the shed. There, he finds the burnt remains of Amara, which he recognizes from her cross necklace. Eli breaks down.That night, Eden tries to sleep. She starts to hear what sounds like a cell phone ringing. She then appears to wake up from what seemed like a bad dream. Here, Eden is revealed to be an author and activist named Veronica Henley, married to Nick (Marque Richardson) with a daughter, Kennedi (London Boyce), all of whom live in present day Atlanta, Georgia. Veronica is well noted for speaking out against the treatment of black Americans, causing her to butt heads with pundits. As she is preparing for an upcoming trip, she sits to have a video conference with another woman... and it\u0027s Elizabeth. She uses condescendingly racist dialogue while discussing Veronica\u0027s book and its themes. Elizabeth also describes herself as a \"talent scout\" while noticing Kennedi, which makes Veronica uncomfortable.After going off on her trip, Veronica meets up with one of her best friends, Dawn (Gabourey Sidibe), as she visits Veronica\u0027s hotel room. She expresses to Dawn some of her frustrations and insecurities with her home life. After Dawn leaves, a mysterious man arrives to bring Veronica flowers but won\u0027t say who they are from. Based on the note that\u0027s left, she assumes they\u0027re from Nick.Veronica steps out of her room and runs into her other close friend Sarah (Lily Cowles), who is joining her and Dawn later that night for dinner and drinks. Meanwhile, Elizabeth sneaks into Veronica\u0027s room, tries on her lipstick, and walks around the room to observe before turning the tag on her door so she won\u0027t get turn-down service. Veronica then attends a conference where she speaks before an audience of black women, all of whom are moved and inspired by her words. As she goes back up to her room, the girl that appeared to be Elizabeth\u0027s daughter is in the elevator with her and creepily tells her she shouldn\u0027t speak unless given permission, but Veronica thinks it\u0027s just a game.Veronica later joins Dawn and Sarah. On the ride to the restaurant, Veronica talks to Nick and thanks him for the flowers, but he says it must have been a fan. Dawn is abrasive toward the staff since she demands the best table and wine. During the night, an unseen man (implied to be Jasper) watches the women all night until he sends a vodka cranberry to Dawn. He then approaches her personally to compliment her, and while flattered, she takes the time to critique his attempt, since she thinks that drink pales in comparison to the wine they are celebrating with, but she gives the man her number just in case. The ladies then prepare to part ways, with Veronica heading into an Uber. Midway through the trip, Veronica gets a call from a woman who says she is her driver waiting outside the restaurant, but she thinks there\u0027s a mistake. Veronica then looks at the driver to see that it\u0027s Elizabeth. Jasper then appears from behind her to grab her. Veronica struggles to break free, but he ultimately knocks her out.Veronica wakes up back on the plantation, where she is still hearing the phone ring. Outside, Him - actually Senator Blake Denton - answers the phone and speaks to someone over how Nick has been all over the news with Kennedi searching for Veronica, and he promises to take care of it. Veronica pretends to be asleep while Denton says he won\u0027t let anyone take her away from him.The next day, Veronica finds that Julia has hung herself. In her despair, she decides that tonight will be the night that they escape. She waits until Denton has fallen asleep, and she manages to sneak outside quietly. Eli finds her and helps her get the cell phone to call for help. They try to make it to the cabin to get a signal, but Purcell and Daniel are out after drinking, forcing the other two to hide and drop the phone. Daniel picks it up, and after Purcell leaves, he stops to urinate. Eli cracks him in the face and leaves Daniel to choke on his blood while they get the phone. They try to make it to the cabin, but Denton attacks the two of them. A fight ensues with Eli hitting Denton to keep him off Veronica, but Denton kills Eli with a hatchet. Veronica hits Denton with a tea kettle before getting his phone. Denton steps out but Veronica stabs him in the gut with a bayonet. She unlocks his phone and manages to call Nick and let him know she is alive, and she sends him a location pin to give to the police. Veronica then goes to Eli\u0027s body and addresses him by his real name, Professor Tarasai.Veronica rolls Denton into a confederate flag and brings him to the shed. He weakly tells her that there will still be more like them, but she scoffs at him. As she goes to get a torch, Jasper finds her, but she tells him that Denton is hurt. Jasper and another guard run into the shed, where Veronica locks them in there and sets the logs on fire to burn all three of them to death. She then rides on horseback as the other soldiers give chase through the woods. After losing most of them, Elizabeth pursues Veronica on her horse. She taunts Veronica and states that Denton (who was really her father) personally picked Veronica because she went against his whole campaign and agenda, while Elizabeth picked everyone else herself. Veronica lassos a noose around Elizabeth\u0027s neck, but Elizabeth slashes at Veronica multiple times until Veronica gains the upper hand and beats Elizabeth\u0027s face. Veronica then rides the horse while pulling Elizabeth until she slams her head against a statue, breaking her neck.Veronica continues to ride as the sun rises and the soldiers continue their re-enacting. She rides outside the gates of the plantation, where it\u0027s revealed that Antebellum is a Civil War re-enactment park. Veronica rides out on her horse to find other people, just as the police arrive, and she appears relieved. The police and feds rescue the kidnapped black people and bulldoze Antebellum to the ground.","numvotes":"25050","primarytitle":"Antebellum"},"color":"rgb(92,73,83)","size":1.0},{"source":"Fantasy","target":"tt0092796","id":"6958","attributes":{"notes":"Anthology collection","runtimeminutes":"92","sex of killer":"male","synopsis":"PrologueA delivery truck pulls up to a newsstand in a small town where a young boy named Billy (a character from the first Creepshow movie) arrives eagerly waiting for it.

The elder bids them farewell and returns to his tribe.When Spruces go back inside their store, the couple are then subject to a vicious robbery led by Benjamin\u0027s nephew, Sam (armed with a shotgun) and his two friends. After ransacking the store, Sam demands that Ray hand over the turquoise. Ray resists, and as a result, the Spruces are then shot and killed by Sam.

Now aware of what has happened, Benjamin wishes the dead Spruces a peaceful afterlife as well as peace for Old Chief Wooden Head now that his revenge quest has been completed. Whitemoon then drives away.Animated Interlude #1Billy is seen at the town post office, receiving a package from when he sent a product ad from his copy of the Creepshow magazine. Incensed by the skeptical clerk\u0027s dismissal of paying $9.99 for a toy from the \"funny papers,\" Billy reveals that the package actually contains the bulb for a carnivorous Venus Flytrap. The clerk doubts the actuality of the package and Billy sets off for home.\"The Raft\"Four college students, Deke, Laverne, Randy, and Rachel decide to go swimming in a desolate lake far away from civilization. As they make their way to a wooden raft in the middle of the lake, they realize that they are being terrorized by floating black blob when it grabs a hold of Rachel and consumes her.The frightened students begin to panic and mourn the loss of Rachel. Deke then contemplates quickly swimming to shore so he can bring back help as he is a fast swimmer. But before he can carry out his plan, the blob seeps through the raft\u0027s cracks and pulls Deke through the raft, killing him in the process. Randy and Laverne manage to evade the creature long enough to where it gives up trying to grab them from under the raft as well.Randy and Laverne spend the entire night on the raft, afraid to fall asleep in fear that the creature will attack them while they sleep. They do manage to fall asleep and Randy is the first to wake up in the morning, relieved to find that Laverne and himself made it through the night. With Laverne still sleeping, he begins caressing her body and fondling her breasts. She soon awakes screaming in agony as the creature has seeped through the cracks and has a hold of her face, much to Randy\u0027s horror.As the oil-like blob pulls her off the raft and begins consuming her, Randy uses the opportunity to jump off the raft and swim to shore. He ultimately makes it, barely escaping the creature and yells \"I beat you!\" However, the oil creature rises up from the water like a wave and engulfs Randy.The oil blob returns to the lake, with no evidence of the four students even visiting the lake other than their car which was left running the whole time. The camera pans out to reveal a \"No Swimming\" sign barely visible from behind some growth.Animated Interlude #2On his way back home from the post office, Billy is ambushed by a gang of neighborhood bullies, who harass him and take his package from him. The gang\u0027s leader then opens the package, finding the Venus Flytrap bulb, and throws it on the ground, crushing it with his foot. In retaliation, Billy kicks the bully in the groin and flees, with the bully and his gang in hot pursuit.\"The Hitchhiker\"An adulterous businesswoman named Annie Lansing (Lois Chiles) gets up from bed after sleeping with her extramarital lover (who is a gigolo), realizing that she has to get home before her wealthy attorney husband to avoid suspicion. Annie hops into her Mercedes-Benz and makes way for home several miles away.On the way, she accidentally kills an innocent hitchhiker (Tom Wright) as a result of her speeding down the dark road, eager to beat her husband to the house. Seeing that no one witnessed the incident, Annie takes off without much thought. Shortly after Annie takes off, the area of the incident is crowded by passersby, with many reporting the hit-and-run to the police.Miles away from the scene, Annie stops along the road and begins thinking about what she has done and the consequences involved, but she ultimately concludes that no one has anything on her and thinks everything will be fine. Before she can continue, however, the hitchhiker she killed suddenly appears outside her window and utters \"Thanks for the ride, lady.\" (A line repeated by the hitchhiker throughout the story).The frightened Annie then speeds off in terror, but everywhere she goes, the hitchhiker always reappears and becomes her tormentor throughout the trip as she repeatedly runs him over, hurls off the top of her car, slams his body into trees, etc. as he only gets more and more battered and bloody without dying. Annie eventually loses control of her car in which she drives off the road and down a hill and into a tree, knocking herself out.She awakes a short while later, not seeing the hitchhiker anywhere in sight, believing it to be a bad dream. She gets back on the road and drives home, succeeding in getting there before her husband. As she begins to step out of her car, the hitchhiker appears from under her car, completely mangled from the trip, still uttering \"Thanks for the ride, lady,\" as he was made or programed to do by the forces of Hell. The hitchhiker begins attacking her as she vainly attempts to fight him off.Later, Annie\u0027s husband finally arrives home to find his wife\u0027s dead body in her car, dead from carbon monoxide poisoning caused from the still running car, with the hitchhiker\u0027s sign lying beside her showing his targeted destination (reading: DOVER).EpilogueStill being chased by the bullies, Billy leads his pursuers into a vacant lot swarming with out of control plant growth. As he rides into what seems to be a dead end, the bullies move in to pummel him only to learn that the bulb they smashed was not the first one Billy had ordered, as a quintet of Giant Flytraps emerge from the surrounding weeds and devour the thugs one by one. The spectacle is witnessed by the Creep himself, who cackles in glee as he drives off in his delivery truck to deliver the latest issue of Creepshow to another town.","numvotes":"24946","primarytitle":"Creepshow 2","productioncompany":"New World Pictures","countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"6.0","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"Creepshow 2","storyline":"\"Creepshow 2\" is divided into three stories, conducted by a leading segment where a boy that loves the horror comic book Creepshow buys seeds of carnivorous plant and is bullied by four teenagers.

He is a Professor of English at the University of Southern California. He explains that there are just a few areas left on Earth that are unknown and briefly describes a few theories that postulate there may be places deep under the surface of the Earth where man can survive.In Asia an archeological dig has discovered something. Dr. Roger Bentley (John Agar) and Prof. Etienne Lafarge (Nestor Paiva) expose a stone tablet. They take it back to their tent to clean and examine it. We are introduced to Dr. Jud Bellamin (Hugh Beaumont) and Dr. Paul Stuart (Phil Chambers) who ask Bentley to translate the find: it may be related to the story of Gilgamesh and Ishtar. An earthquake rattles the area and the tablet is broken. This puts their work a month behind schedule. A small boy discovers something the earthquake brought down a mountain and brings it to Bentley. He cleans it and it is revealed to be an ancient oil lamp. The inscription is translated as a pre-biblical Noah\u0027s Ark story. The party of scientists set off for the mountain where the artifact originated before it was dislodged by the earthquake.They set up base camp and plan their final assault on the mountain the next day. A storm hits the base camp that evening. As they set off the next morning an avalanche brings down an arm from a statue. They continue climbing and discover the ruins of an ancient Sumarian civilization on a small plateau. They estimate the ruins are 5,000 years old. While Dr. Stuart walks around the ruins he falls down through an opening. The rest of the party goes down on ropes to save him. Bentley leads the way, followed by Lafarge, who is much older than the rest. Bellamin is third down the opening followed by Nazar (Rodd Redwing). After dropping down about 200 feet Bentley finds Stuart, but he died in the fall. Nazar notices a loose piton and hammers it secure, but that triggers a rockfall and he is killed and the three archeologists are trapped.They start searching for a way out, but Lafarge is experiencing breathing problems. He is also claustrophobic, They wander through the cave and discover a light source, which reveals a large underground city. They notice a very large tablet that informs them they have discovered the temple of Ishtar. They bed down for the night, but a lizard creature (a mole person?) digs up to the surface to spy on the three. A short time later, the party is attacked, sacks are placed over their heads, and they are pulled underground. They awake in a cave and Lafarge has claw marks on his chest. Two very pale white representative of the human underground civilization suddenly appear and direct they follow them. The scientists are escorted back to the city and presented to the High Priest, Ilinu (Alan Napier) who is performing a ritual. Ilinu immediately suspects the strangers and tells the king that they are evil. The king questions the three archeologists. At the conclusion of the questioning the high priest sentences them to death.The three escape into a cave, with guards in hot pursuit. Bentley shines his flashlight in the face of the First Officer (Robin Hughes) who cringes and retreats. It seems the light hurts their eyes. The three return to the city and shine their flashlight on the King and High Priest and they also retreat. The inhabitants of the city are albino, adapted to a world without sunlight. A lizard creature pulls the body of one of the guards underground. Seeing this, Lafarge panics and runs back into one of the caves. Bentley and Bellamin follow and discover a slave labor camp where the lizard creatures are forced to cultivate the food source--mushrooms. The guards whip their charges, which particularly incenses Bentley. Laforge is attacked and killed by a lizard creature, but is driven off by the flashlight before he can eat Laforge.Bentley and Bellamin return to the city and are met by the high priest along the way who tells them that they are welcome back to the city since they \"possess the divine fire of Ishtar\". The King is convinced they are holy messengers and are invited to a feast. One of the servers, Adad (Cynthia Patrick) drops her bowl of mushrooms, and is ordered whipped by the king. Bentley stops the punishment and is told not to interfere by the High Priest. Bentley helps her to her feet and notices she is not albino, but normally pigmented. The King presents Adad as a gift to Bentley. The High Priest explains that she is not human (like them) but a \"marked one\". The King and Priest further explain that when the population gets too large the excess are sacrificed in the fire of Ishtar.Bentley and Adad talk about their respective worlds as the High Priest spies on them. The next day Bentley and Bellamin tour the city. Meanwhile the High Priest meets with his fellow priests and plots to get the flashlight. This will show the king that the strangers are not divine, but mere mortals.Bentley and Bellamin intercede when three lizard creatures are being beaten, but their flashlight batteries begin to fail. They free the lizard creatures. Food production has been reduced because the lizard creatures are rebelling against their mistreatment. The High Priest schedules another sacrifice. After a ritual dance three women are escorted into a brightly lit chamber, enter, and are locked in. When they open the chamber later, the charred remains are carried out on stretchers. The High Priest is shown the dead body of Laforge. The High Priest was told by Bentley that Laforge was called back to Ishtar, reinforcing the story of his divinity. The High Priest shows the body to the king and explains that he is mortal and asks the King for permission to kill Bentley and Bellamin. The King agrees. Bentley and Bellamin are drugged and arrested. Elinu takes possession of the flashlight. Adad escapes and is captured by the lizard creatures. Bentley and Bellamin are taken to the lighted sacrifice chamber and locked in. The lizard creatures attack the city in force and kill the inhabitants, including the King and High Priest.The lizard creatures break open the sacrifice chamber, but the light repels them. Adad isn\u0027t afraid of the light and joins Bentley and Bellamin on their ascent back to their world. They reach the top and get into warmer clothes. Another earthquake strikes the area, and Adad is killed when a stone pillar crushes her.

The evil creature is released later, charges the stone with people souls and feeds with their fears, while chasing Alexandra to force to make three wishes and unleash the demoniac fiends upon Earth. —Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","startyear":"1997","runtimeminutes":"90","sex of killer":"unhuman","synopsis":"The narrator, Angus Scrimm, in his only words in the film, introduces the audience to the creatures called \"djinn***\" ***(which are actually mohammedian efreets; correction should concern every following mistake).\" with the following statement:Once, in a time before time, God breathed life into the universe. And the light gave birth to Angels. And the earth gave birth to Man. And the fire gave birth to the Djinn, creatures condemned to dwell in the void between the worlds. One who wakes a Djinn shall be given three wishes. Upon the granting of the third, the unholy legions of the Djinn shall be freed to rule the earth. Fear one thing in all there is...fear the Djinn.   The next scene is set in Persia during the year 1127 A.D. with the Djinn asking a Persian emperor to make his second wish. The emperor asks the Djinn to show him wonders. The Djinn uses his powers to torture and mutilate people in the palace. Before the emperor can make his third wish, Zoroaster, a sorcerer (Ari Barak), interrupts and states that upon the third wish granted to the one who woke the Djinn, a gateway will open between the worlds and the evil race of Djinn can live on earth. The sorcerer then reveals a fire opal. The Djinn is sucked into the jewel, where he remains captured.In present day America Raymond Beaumont (Robert Englund) is supervising workers as they lower a box containing an antique statue of Ahura Mazda onto a ship\u0027s deck. The worker who is lowering the crate is drinking on the job and accidentally drops it from his crane, killing Beaumont\u0027s assistant (Ted Raimi) and destroying the statue. It breaks open and a dockworker finds the fire opal inside which he steals and pawns. The jewel ends up at Regal Auctioneers, where boss Nick Merritt (Chris Lemmon) gives it to appraiser Alexandra Amberson to examine. Her examinations of the jewel wake the Djinn.Thinking she saw something inside the jewel, Alexandra takes it to her labworker best friend and potential love interest, Josh Aickman (Tony Crane) to analyze. Later, as he is collecting data, light reflections cause the gem to explode and the Djinn is released. The lab is destroyed and Josh is killed, upon his wish for relief from his physical pain.Alex, thinking the gem has something to do with the explosion and subsequent death of Josh, tracks down Beaumont, to whom the statue belonged. Beaumont tells Alex to visit a folklore professor named Wendy Derleth (Jenny O\u0027Hara) to find out more about Ahura Mazda and the gem. He also invites Alex and her sister, Shannon (Wendy Benson) to a party he is hosting.The folklore professor tells Alex about the jewel, the Djinn, and its evil history. Later, Alex learns that the Djinn needs to power the gem with the soul of humans, and then grant her three wishes before he can unleash the Djinn on Earth. During this time, the Djinn, who had been in demonic form removes the face of a corpse in the morgue, taking on the dead man\u0027s form and the name Nathaniel Demerest. The Djinn, now as Nathaniel, goes about granting people wishes in return for their souls while he searches for Alex. He finally tracks down Alex\u0027s boss and grants him a greed-inflicted wish so that he can get Alex\u0027s address.Alex is haunted by visions whenever the Djinn grants a wish. She goes to Wendy\u0027s house to consult with her again, but Nathaniel has already killed her and taken her form. During their conversation, Alex realizes she is really talking to the Djinn. He confronts her and asks her to make three wishes. He even gives her a \"test\" wish. She uses this wish and orders the Djinn to kill itself. He complies by blowing his head off with a gun, yet the wound heals instantly; as the Djinn is immortal, he cannot be killed. Alex then uses the first of the \"official\" three wishes: Her first being to know her opponent, the Djinn. He teleports her to his terrifying world within the gem, thus demonstrating his true nature to her. Next, she wishes herself back to her apartment, alone. The Djinn had been threatening Alex\u0027s sister, so Alex sets about finding Shannon. She races to Beaumont\u0027s party and Nathaniel follows. While talking to Nathaniel at the party, Beaumont makes the mistake of wishing his party would be unforgettable, and Nathaniel begins wreaking havoc by causing the art pieces to kill the guests.The Djinn finally corners Alex and traps Shannon, trying to scare Alex into making the ultimate third wish. Alex wishes that the dockworker had not been drinking on the job two days ago undoing the events that followed (and presumably reviving the Djinn\u0027s victims back to life) and trapping the Djinn in the opal. The dock scene is shown again and the now sober operator has no trouble lowering the crate containing Ahura Mazda. Alex goes to see Josh at the lab. He notices that Alex is strangely pleased with herself, but she will not say why.Back on the statue of Ahura Mazda, which is now in Beaumont\u0027s private collection, the camera zooms inside the jewel and shows us the Djinn on a throne, waiting to be released.","numvotes":"23000","primarytitle":"Wishmaster"},"color":"rgb(76,80,97)","size":3.0},{"source":"other","target":"tt0278966","id":"6713","attributes":{"notes":"Vampire themes","runtimeminutes":"90","sex of killer":"male","numvotes":"11","primarytitle":"Banquete das Taras","productioncompany":"W.C.

Brock\u0027s spontaneous poetry recital. Despite the poet\u0027s open disdain for his simplistic, gullible nature, Walter clings to Maxwell\u0027s words and admires his associates, especially sketch artist Carla (Barbour Morris). Unknown to the customers and Yellow Door owner Leonard De Santis, two undercover police officers, Art Lacroix and Lou Raby, take turns staking out the café for possible drug deals.After his shift ends, Walter returns to his small apartment frustrated over his inability to convince the Yellow Door patrons of his artistic potential. When his attempt at sculpting proves futile, Walter lashes out angrily at his landlady\u0027s cat and accidentally kills the animal. At first horrified, Walter then covers the cat\u0027s body with clay and the next day presents it to Leonard and Carla as a work of art.Amazed by the realistic quality of the \"sculpture,\" Leonard displays the cat in the café and that evening Walter is showered with praise by the Yellow Door regulars, including Maxwell. One customer, Naolia, is so moved by the work that she offers Walter a small vial as a gift. Lou notices the exchange and, following Walter home, asks to see the vial and discovers it contains heroin. Walter is surprised and confused when Lou reveals his identity and demands to know the name of his dealer. Frightened when Lou pulls a gun and places him under arrest, Walter lashes out with a frying pan, splitting Lou\u0027s skull. Meanwhile at the café, Leonard is closing up when he accidentally knocks over Walter\u0027s cat sculpture and to his horror, discovers fur underneath the clay.The next afternoon when Walter returns to work, Leonard makes sarcastic remarks to him about his artistic talent, but Carla and Maxwell come to his defense. Emboldened, Walter reveals he has a new work to show them, entitled \"Murdered Man,\" which stuns Leonard. On his way to telephone the authorities, however, Leonard is approached by a wealthy art collector who offers five hundred dollars for the cat sculpture. Leonard warily agrees, then later goes with Carla to Walter\u0027s apartment to see the new work, which is Lou\u0027s body covered with clay. Shocked, Leonard refuses to display the work at the Yellow Door, but when Carla and Walter express puzzlement, Leonard suggests Walter make other pieces in order to put together a show. The distressed café owner encourages Walter to move away from realism and try \"free form\" art, then pays him fifty dollars from the cat sculpture sale.Ecstatic by his newfound success, Walter ceases working at the Yellow Door, and, affecting a beatnik style, becomes one of the café\u0027s customers, where he joins Maxwell\u0027s table of artists. One afternoon soon after Walter\u0027s initial success, Alice, a part-time model who has been out of town, joins the group but is critical of Walter, whom she knows only as a busboy. Offended by Alice\u0027s put-downs, Walter departs, but later follows her home to ask her to pose for him. Alice agrees and goes to Walter\u0027s apartment, where he strangles her with a scarf, then makes another \"sculpture\" that he takes to the café the next day.Profoundly affected by Walter\u0027s abilities, Maxwell delivers a poetic homage to him that night at the Yellow Door. After a drunken, boisterous night of acclaim, Walter heads for home, but grows frightened at the notion that his fame might be short-lived. Spotting a man cutting wood at a lumber mill, Walter attacks the man and cuts his head off with a large table saw. The next day, Leonard is mortified when Walter brings in his newest work, the bust of a man, and pleads with him to stop sculpting, declaring they have enough pieces for a show. Walter agrees and Leonard sends out invitations for his exhibition.On the night of the show, Walter takes Carla aside and proposes, but Carla insists that while she admires Walter\u0027s works, she is not in love with him. Angered and hurt, Walter asks Carla if she will pose for him later and she agrees. At the show, Walter, distressed over Carla\u0027s rejection, ignores the renowned art critics admiring his work. A little later, Carla closely examines Alice\u0027s sculpture and is terrified when some melting clay reveals a real finger. Carla confronts Walter who quotes Maxwell\u0027s poetry and insists he has only immortalized worthless people. Appalled, Carla flees from the café and Walter follows. Meanwhile, Art has also examined some sculptures and, realizing they are dead bodies, pursues Walter. Maxwell and several of his friends also discover the truth behind the sculptures and run after Walter.Haunted by the voices of his victims who assure him that he will be reviled now that he has been discovered, Walter abandons chasing Carla and instead rushes home in fright.

He is there to follow up on a letter addressed specifically to him from an anonymous source on Summerisle reporting that a twelve year old girl who lives on the island, Rowan Morrison, the daughter of May Morrison, has long been missing. The correspondence includes a photograph of Rowan. Upon his arrival on Summerisle, Howie finds that the locals are a seemingly simple minded lot who provide little information beyond the fact that they know of no Rowan Morrison and do not know the girl in the photo. Mrs. Morrison admits to having a daughter, seven year old Myrtle, but no Rowan. As Howie speaks to more and more people, he begins to believe that Rowan does or did live on the island, but that the locals are hiding their knowledge of her. He also begins to see that the locals all have pagan beliefs, their \"religion\" which centers on procreation as the source of life. That procreation does not necessarily need to be within marriage, and openly flaunts the act of sex, both in private and in public. These beliefs do not sit well against Howie\u0027s strict Christian morals, he who regularly attends church, prays, and accepts communion. Everything that happens on the island seems to be dictated by Lord Summerisle, whose ancestors bought the island generations ago. Howie begins to believe that Rowan was murdered, she a sacrifice by the islanders to their higher power to ensure a bountiful apple crop - the main crop of the island - which did not materialize last season. With May Day approaching, Howie not only tries to find out if Rowan was indeed murdered/sacrificed, which includes trying to locate her body, but if there will be another sacrifice on this important day within the cycle of life. —Huggo","startyear":"1973","runtimeminutes":"88","synopsis":"Sergeant Neil Howie of the West Highland Police receives an anonymous letter requesting his presence on Summerisle, a remote Hebridean island famed for its popular and unusually abundant fruit produce. A young girl named Rowan Morrison has been missing for a number of months and her mother is being uncooperative with enquiries. Due to the island\u0027s isolation it is unlikely she could have left by herself, abduction is suspected.Howie, a devout and celibate Christian, travels by seaplane to the island and is profoundly disturbed to find a society that worships the old pagan, Celtic gods of their ancestors. Couples copulate openly in the fields, children are taught in school of the phallic importance of the maypole, toads are placed in the mouth to cure whooping cough, and the island has no Christian ministers or priests. Its church and graveyards have long been deconsecrated and are now used for the idiosyncratic burial rituals of the locals, who believe in re-incarnation.In the course of his investigation, Howie encounters difficulty in extracting information from the islanders, who claim never to have heard of Rowan, and whose own mother insists does not exist. Rooming at The Green Man Inn, where he is introduced to the beautiful young daughter of the landlord, Willow, Howie notices a series of photographs celebrating the island\u0027s annual harvests adorning the wall of the bar with each photograph featuring a young girl, the May Queen. The latest photograph is missing due to it being \"broken\". No negative exists.After discovering a grave bearing Rowan Morrison\u0027s name in the cemetery, Howie\u0027s search eventually brings him into contact with the island\u0027s community leader, Laird and de facto figurehead Lord Summerisle, who explains to Howie the island\u0027s recent history and culture. Summerisle\u0027s grandfather, a distinguished Victorian scientist, developed several new strains of fruit that he believed could prosper in Scotland\u0027s climate given the proper conditions. Drawn to Summerisle\u0027s unique combination of fertile, volcanic soil and local waters heated by the Gulf Stream, he inculcated in the local populace a belief that the old gods were real and worshipping them by farming the new crop strains would deliver them from their meagre livelihood. The crops bore fruit and the island\u0027s Christian clergy were driven away, with the population now embracing pagan teachings wholesale. Enraged by Summerisle\u0027s glib comment that the Christian god is \"dead\", Howie demands permission to exhume Rowan\u0027s body, which Lord Summerisle subsequently grants, confident in the belief that such a deeply religious community as his is incapabale of murder. Howie\u0027s exhumation of the grave reveals only the body of a hare. He angrily confronts Summerisle once more, declaring that he believes that Rowan Morrison was murdered as part of a pagan sacrifice and that he intends to bring the full weight of the law upon the inhabitants of the island.Breaking into the local chemist\u0027s shop, Howie discovers that a negative of last year\u0027s harvest photograph does in fact exist. It shows Rowan standing amidst a meagre, pathetic group of boxes, indicating that last year\u0027s harvest was a poor one and that the crops the island\u0027s only means of income had failed. Struck by his recollection of an offhand remark made by Lord Summerisle about appeasing the old gods \"when necessary\" and by research that indicates pagan societies offer up a human sacrifice in the event of crop failure, Howie deduces that Rowan is in fact still alive and that she is being kept hidden until she can be sacrificed as part of the May Day celebrations to ensure a plentiful harvest for the coming year.Howie spends another night at the Inn where, in the room next to his, Willow sings to him and openly attempts to seduce him. The next morning, discovering that his plane has been sabotaged and is unable to take off, Howie elects to search the island for Rowan himself ahead of the impending May Day parade. Howie ties up the innkeeper and assumes his place as Punch, a principal character of the May Day festival. Disguised, he joins the procession of islanders as they cavort through the town and perform harmless sacrifices to the various lesser gods. Then Lord Summerisle announces that a grimmer sacrifice awaits them, and Rowan is finally revealed, tied to a post. Howie cuts her free and flees through a cave but after a brief chase emerges at another entrance on a precipice where Summerisle and his followers stand waiting for them. Howie is shocked to see Rowan merrily embrace her captors and then notices that he is being surrounded.Lord Summerisle explains to Howie that, after painstaking research on their behalf, he specifically was lured to Summerisle by the islanders, who have been successful in a conspiracy to lead him to believe that a missing girl was being held captive against her will, and confirms to him that last year\u0027s harvest failed disastrously, threatening the inhabitants with a return to their previously desperate existence and that they have no intention of allowing that to happen. Their religion calls for a sacrifice to be made to the Sun god as Lord Summerisle explains that, \"animals are fine, but their acceptibility is limited. A young child is even better, but not nearly as effective as the right kind of adult.\" Howie\u0027s devout Christian lifestyle and his livelihood as a policeman mean that he meets the outstanding criteria for a human that is to be sacrificed to appease the gods he has come of his own free will, with the power of a king and he is a virgin. In spite of his protestations that the crops failed because fruit was not meant to grow on these islands and that next year the sacrifice of Lord Summerisle himself will be called for, Howie is stripped bare, then dressed in ceremonial robes and led to the summit of a cliff with his hands tied. He is horrified to find a giant, hollow wicker man statue which he is then locked inside. The statue is soon set afire. As the islanders surround the burning wicker man and sing the Middle English folk-song \"Sumer Is Icumen In\", a terrified Howie curses them and recites Psalm 23 as he prays to God for accession to Heaven. The film ends as the burning head of the wicker man falls from its shoulders, as the sun sets in a blood-red sky.","numvotes":"78669","primarytitle":"The Wicker Man"},"color":"rgb(65,97,106)","size":1.0},{"source":"Fantasy","target":"tt0023245","id":"6772","attributes":{"notes":"Museum as a setting; orientalism","runtimeminutes":"73","sex of killer":"female","synopsis":"An ancient Egyptian priest called Imhotep (Boris Karloff) is revived when an archaeological expedition in 1921 led by Sir Joseph Whemple (Arthur Byron) finds Imhotep\u0027s mummy.

Intrigued, the Bat follows the robber, who leads him to the old Fleming mansion.Inside the Fleming mansion, Cornelia van Gorder [Grayce Hamptom] and her ditzy maid Lizzie Allen [Maude Eburne] are discussing Cornelia\u0027s decision to rent the house for the summer. The big old house is a scary place, and Lizzie doesn\u0027t like the strange sounds, the strange caretaker [Spencer Charters], and the strange stories he tells about seeing ghosts in the house. Add to the fact that the Bat has taken to the country, and Lizzie is terrified of everything and anything. She\u0027s even gone so far as to set a bear trap outside her bedroom window, just in case the Bat decides to pay a vist. When Cornelia\u0027s niece Dale [Una Merkel], who works at the Oakdale Bank, returns home with her boyfriend Brook Bailey[William Bakewell] and tries to pass him off as a gardener, Cornelia is immediately suspicious (Cornelia: Any experience with alopecias? Brook: They dry up if you don\u0027t water them.), but Cornelia hires him anyway, at least until she can find out why Dale has brought him home.A rock suddenly comes crashing through the window. A note on it reads: Get out of the house now while there is still time. Immediately thereafter, Dr Venrees [Gustav von Seyffertitz] drops by to inform Cornelia that the Oakdale bank has been robbed of a half million dollars and that Fleming, Sr, the owner of the mansion, is returning from Europe so Cornelia will have to vacate the house. Then, a heavy painting moves, and a voice from behind warns them to get out of the house. Becoming concerned, Cornelia phones the police. When Detective Anderson [Chester Morris] shows up, Cornelia explains her suspicion that Fleming, Jr [Hugh Huntley] is trying to frighten her out of the house, possibly because he rented it to her while his father was out of the country. Nowthat his father is returning, she thinks he may be trying to frighten her into leaving.Soon everyone begins acting suspiciously. The doctor unlocks the broken window and \"forgets\" to relock it until Cornelia relocks it herself. Alone in the parlor for a few moments, Venrees unlocks the window again. Brook starts going around the house pounding on the walls. Dale phones Fleming Jr and asks him to come over. When he does, he brings a blueprint of the house so that they can locate a hidden room. Before they can find it, he is murdered, and Dale hides a piece torn from the blueprint under a tray. A storm is approaching, and the lightning knocks out the electricity. Someone phones from the garage, but when Det Anderson goes out to check, there is no one there. Detective Jones [Charles Dow Clark] arrives to help with the investigation. Dr Venrees finds the torn piece from the blueprint showing that the hidden room is behind a fireplace, but Det Anderson forces him to hand it over. When Anderson is poring over the blueprint, Venrees clobbers him with a heavy statue and locks his body in a closet. In the lightning flashes, the silhouette of the Bat can be seen peering into the window.It gets even more intriguing. Brook turns out to be a cashier from the bank and the primary suspect in the theft. Fleming Sr is seen walking on the roof when he\u0027s supposed to be out of the country. Dale finds the secret room behind a fireplace and gets locked in, along with the Bat, Mr Fleming Sr, and the money. The Bat shoots Fleming Sr. Dale escapes and leads Inspector Jones, Cornelia, and Dr Venrees to the secret room. Just as the fireplace swings open, Venrees blows out the candle, allowing whomever was in the room to escape. Finally, Inspector Anderson figures it out. Dr Venrees and Fleming Sr robbed the bank together and hid the money in the house. Anderson arrests Venrees and locks him in a closet.A strange man suddenly stumbles into the room. He\u0027s been hit in the head and is suffering from amnesia. He remembers only that he tried to phone from the garage. As they search the secret room for the money and find nothing, Cornelia thinks that she sees someone out on the roof and Anderson goes outside to catch him. Shortly thereafter, the garage is set afire. The amnesic man grabs a gun and orders everyone to be silent. The fire was set to get everyone out of the room, he explains, and the person who set that fire will be back shortly to get the money. They blow out the candles and wait. The Bat enters the house. The amnesic man points the gun at the Bat and orders Inspector Jones to disarm him. Just as they prepare to remove the black hood from the Bat\u0027s face, the Bat creates a distraction by knocking over a chair and escaping...right into the bear trap that Lizzie set so many hours ago.The Bat has been captured. They remove his hood to see that it\u0027s Detective Anderson. The amnesic explains that he is the real Detective Anderson, but he was clobbered in the garage by the Bat, who took his IDs. But the Bat isn\u0027t ready to be captured. While he extols his great intellect, he pulls out a gun he found on the ground and forces everyone to put up their hands. Only Cornelia refuses. I took the bullets out of that gun only ten minutes ago, she says. Everyone jumps on the Bat, and the gun goes off. Cornelia was lying!As the movie closes and the curtain falls on the stage, the Bat drops down from the ceiling. Chester Morris, who played Detective Anderson and the Bat, then addresses the audience. He asks them not to reveal the identity of the Bat to anyone and promises that, if they keep the secret, the Bat will not haunt their homes, steal their money, or frighten their children.

A hand suddenly appears from under her dress. Su-Mi awakes with a start realizing everything she has witnessed was still a dream.Tension continues to rise among the three females as their menstrual cycles become synched together.Su-Mi finds several family photos which reveal that their stepmother was once a nurse her father worked with and apparently was also a live-in nurse for the girl\u0027s mother. Su-Yeon enters the room and Su-Mi discovers bruises on her arm, but when she angrily questions her if their stepmother was the cause, Su-Yeon refuses to answer and runs out. Su-Mi confronts her stepmother about Su-Yeons injuries. The stepmother angrily responds to Su-Mi by telling her that she is now the sister\u0027s mother and that they must accept it and bear the worst that life has to offer. She also questions if Su-Mi is feeling well.That night, the sister\u0027s uncle and his wife arrive for a visit. They dine with the father and stepmother, whose behavior is extremely exaggerated and odd. When she asks the uncle if he remembers a peculiar event he tells her he doesn\u0027t. She responds icily: \"Why don\u0027t you remember? Are you crazy?\"Suddenly, the uncle\u0027s wife starts to convulse. She is thrown to the floor and has a violent attack. When she recovers the uncle drives her home and she informs him that during her attack she saw a girl under the kitchen sink. The stepmother sees the girl too and tells the sister\u0027s father that ever since Su-Mi and Su-Yeon returned home weird things have been happening inside the house. The father seems unconvinced.The stepmother goes into Su-Yeon\u0027s room where she discovers that photos of her have been mutilated and her face has been scratched out. Enraged, she attacks Su-Yeon and throws her into a wardrobe closet and locks her inside and refuses to let the terrified girl out. When the stepmother leaves the room, Su-Mi suspecting something is wrong, enters the bedroom and releases her sister from the closet. Overcome, she comforts Su-Yeon and tells her that she is sorry, that she didnt\u0027 hear Su-Yeon\u0027s pleas for help and that this will never happen again.The father enters and asks Su-Mi why all these bad things have been happening since she returned. Su-Mi says that it\u0027s the stepmother to blame and that his new wife has been attacking Su-Yeon. The father tells her to stop it and screams at her that Su-Yeon is dead. Neither Su-Mi, nor Su-Yeon, is pleased to hear this news.The father makes a phone call and informs the other person that he/she must come to the house tomorrow. The next morning, the stepmother is shown dragging a large sack with something inside it into the house and she starts beating it with a stick. The noise awakens Su-Mi. When she gets up she finds a note from her father saying he will return to the house that afternoon.Su-Mi runs to find Su-Yeon and sees a trail of blood on the floor. Following it leads to the sack the stepmother dragged in earlier. Su-Mi thinks it is Su-Yeon inside, but she can\u0027t get the bag open. She goes to the kitchen to retrieve a knife and when she returns she finds that the sack has been moved to the wardrobe closet. She also finds that her stepmother is behind her ready to throw boiling water on her. A violent fight ensues between the two females and Su-Mi stumbles and is knocked unconscious. Her stepmother drags her to another part of the house and retrieves a garden statue.As Su-Mi regains consciousness, the stepmother asks her what brought them to this point and reminds Su-Mi of a conversation the two once had where the stepmother told her that one day Su-Mi would live to regret something and that no matter how hard Su-Mi would try to forget it, she would never be able to. The stepmother then proceeds to drop the statue on Su-Mi\u0027s head as the father returns.He finds an unconscious Su-Mi as well as the injured stepmother. He attends to the stepmother\u0027s injuries and leaves the room. When the door opens again, someone else enters: the real stepmother. How can this new person be the stepmother when the original stepmother is sitting right there looking at herself?The camera turns 360 degrees to reveal that Su-Mi has been in the house alone with her father the past few days and that the conversations and events she had previously had with Su-Yeon and her stepmother were the result of her schizophrenic mind.The father and real stepmother take Su-Mi back to the hospital and the stepmother returns to the house alone that evening. There she hears an odd noise upstairs in what was once Su-Yeon\u0027s bedroom. When she goes to investigate she encounters a ghost hiding in the wardrobe closet.Flashback scenes reveal that one day some time ago, the father visited the house with the stepmother after what was an apparent marriage, or engagement, to his mistress. His ex-wife, the uncle and the uncle\u0027s wife are also there. An argument results and the sister\u0027s real mother goes into Su-Yeon\u0027s room. When her daughter goes to sleep the mother hangs herself in Su-Yeon\u0027s wardrobe closet. The apparition Su-Mi dreamed of earlier was her hanged mother.In the reveal, Su-Yeon wakens and the door to her closet opens. When she looks inside she finds her mother hanged. She shakes the lifeless body in an attempt to revive it, but instead pulls the wardrobe closet down on top of her. There she suffocates, or is slowly crushed to death, by the weight of her mother and the closet. She desperately strikes at the floor with her hand and calls out for Su-Mi to help her.We also learn that the stepmother having heard something upstairs goes into Su-Yeon\u0027s room. There she discovers the turned over wardrobe, but apparently thinks it is the father\u0027s wife under the closet. She does nothing to help her and quickly leaves the room. She encounters Su-Mi and the two exchange words. The stepmother tells Su-Mi that Su-Mi will one day regret something and that she will not be able to make it go away. Su-Mi brushes past her and leaves the house. She hesitates and thinks about going back inside, but instead she goes for a walk down a pathway not knowing that her life has changed forever and that she won\u0027t be able to ever make the past events go away.","numvotes":"60965","primarytitle":"A Tale of Two Sisters"},"color":"rgb(92,73,83)","size":1.0},{"source":"Mystery","target":"tt0061036","id":"7198","attributes":{"productioncompany":"Arco Film","countriesoforigin":"Italy","averagerating":"6.3","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"La strega in amore","storyline":"A historian goes to a castle library to translate some ancient erotic literature.

A woman, (Rosanna Schiaffino), appears holding a guitar. She introduces herself as Aura, daughter of Consuelo. He explains that her mother has fainted and seems to have taken a drink of potion from a cup which he hands her. She replies that it must be difficult for her mother who was formerly a beauty queen.

She says maybe later.They gaze through an iron grating at Consuelo and Aura asks if he really thought she meant to seduce him. He is surprised and asks how she knew that. She doesn\u0027t answer. He asks if she is amused by that to which she replies yes. She shows him to the garden.She answers that she knows he was summoned by the ad. He asks what reasons she knows why he should take the job. Good food and peace and tranquility, she says. She tells him that her door is never locked and he tells her that the most important thing is for her to be like her mother was when she was young. They go into the greenhouse, where she tells him her mother grows a plant she brought with her from Mexico in a tea which she drinks. He kisses her and asks if she likes it. She agrees.There is a catfight and she asks him to chase them away. He picks up some clods and throws them at the cats. At least one cat is seen exiting the window. She tells him she cooks with herbs that she grows in the greenhouse. She asks him to fetch her some aloe vera which is good for healing. He goes to find it and when he looks back, she is gone. He goes to leave and notices a dead cat which has been strangled with a string around its neck. He goes calling for Aura.Going back upstairs in the house, he finds Consuelo and asks about her. She claims she was going to connect the electricity so that she would hear the bell when the doctor arrived. He tells her about the dead cat that was tortured before it died. She makes a reference to some hoodlums who come over the wall to torment the cats. She asks for his arm to help her to her room.Consuelo asks Sergio how he likes her daughter. He says he likes her but that she is different from most girls. She confesses that she is jealous of Aura and is afraid some common man will take her away from her.

She tells him that there are no secrets between her and her daughter and that Aura is waiting for him in the library.When he is unable to find Aura in the library, he calls Marta on the phone, telling her he will be home soon. As he does this, he notices a mummified body in a glass coffin. Stunned, he hangs up and goes to look. Aura speaks from a nearby rocking chair, telling him it is her father who is embalmed here and that he is the author of the journals in the library. He asks and is told that Consuelo comes and stares at the body for hours.She retrieves a book and begins talking about the author who took a lover of age 13. He begins to caress her about the shoulders. She asks why he is attempting to undress her and he mentions making love. She asks if he would like music and puts on a record.

They begin embracing until a noise is heard in the room.They look up and see Fabrizio (Gian Maria Volonté) placing some books on a shelf, having just awakened. Surprised to see her, Fabrizio approaches and welcomes her back. She suggests that Sergio has tried to attack her and that she resisted. Fabrizio turns to question Sergio, who denies an attack. Fabrizio looks him over for signs of resistance but finds none. Asking why he is there, Fabrizio hears that Sergio has answered an ad for a librarian. Sergio tells Fabrizio that he is still the incumbent librarian and that no one has fired him. He questions Aura as to why he is there. She claims that he has been rejected by her and her mother although initially was accepted. She tells Sergio to go, reassuring Fabrizio that he will remain. Sergio asks what the ending to the comedy is. He receives a slap on the face from Aura.  Good ending.  he says.Fabrizio questions Sergio about whether Consuelo rejected him or he chose not to take the job. Sergio tells him Consuelo changed her mind. When Fabrizio asks what if anything the old woman said about him, Sergio replies  nothing good.  Sergio turns to leave.Hearing a strange noise, Sergio finds Consuelo conducting a ritual with a crucifix. She stops when she sees him, telling him that the doctor friend just left. She convinced the doctor that there was a misunderstanding.Sergio calls out the window to his friend Marco (Vittorio Venturoli) who is leaving. As he tells the old woman he is leaving, she insists he say goodbye to Aura. He approaches Aura in the next room and sits by her. Consuelo tells him that they had hoped he would prove to be a good friend and that she lied to him earlier about the dead cat. It is Fabrizio who tortured the cat, she claims. She wants Sergio to do Auras eyebrows. He is handed the pencil and begins tracing her eyebrows. She tells him to go.Outside, Sergio is told by his friend that the old lady said he had left. He asks if the doctor thinks she is crazy and is told that most likely she takes drugs. Offering to take Sergio to lunch, the doctor drives off after being told that Sergio will remain.Sergio questions the owner of a nearby antique shop about the purchases bought from the old lady. She claims the money is in the millions and that Consuelo is at least twenty years older than she. Sergio disbelieves that, pointing out that she has a young daughter. He is told Consuelo has no daughter and that most of the money went towards facial reconstruction. Sergio returns to the house.He sees Fabrizio praying for strength in the chapel. Sitting down, he offers an amen to the prayer. Fabrizio questions why he has returned, then urges Sergio to serve as a confessor in the chapels confessional. Fabrizio confesses to living in hell and loving it. He tells of a false body near him each night to which he is addicted and wants absolution. When Sergio tells him he cannot absolve him, Fabrizio is upset and tells Sergio he should leave. Sergio also recommends that Fabrizio leave, which he says he cannot do. He asks that they make a pact that if he can convince Aura that Sergio will leave.Aura comes in and tells Fabrizio it is time for the bath. He points out that Sergio has come back and tells her to welcome him with a kiss. She approaches Sergio as if to kiss him but whispers  thank you. Aura prepares the bath and Fabrizio tells Sergio that he was destitute when he first came but that the old lady gave him everything he has now. He tells Aura to pour a drink for Sergio, which she does. She goes back into the bathroom and changes into a robe as Sergio watches through the door. He tells Fabrizio that it is time for him to leave them alone. Fabrizio says it is time for his bath and goes in. Sergio approaches Aura and they begin kissing on the bed. They talk about Fabrizio and she admits she is afraid of him. They begin more passionate kissing and Aura pushes him away, saying that Fabrizio is watching. He is shown looking through the glass at them. She says to Sergio that it is impossible tonight and goes into the bathroom. Sergio feels something under the pillow and finds a small gun. He examines it and places it back. Hearing them kissing, he opens the door and is told by Fabrizio that it is impossible tonight. Aura is seen sitting on the bed. Sergio leaves.Fabrizio and Aura are seen fencing (they are wearing no masks). He gives her some instructions. They look over and see Sergio watching them. Fabrizio gives her an epée and they resume. He strikes her epée down and teases her with the tip of the blade. Sergio rushes over to her aid, but is rebuffed by Fabrizio, who tells him to stop being a hero. She excuses herself and leaves. Sergio tells Fabrizio that he is tormenting her and keeping her as a slave. Fabrizio answers that she likes him, which is disputed by Sergio. Telling Fabrizio that he will take the job, Sergio is told that the job belongs to Fabrizio. Sergio says he will ask Consuelo.They enter Consuelos quarters and Fabrizio tells her that Aura is pleased with him. She asks Sergio what he wants and he begins to tell her that he wants the job, but is interrupted by Fabrizio, who insists that she tell Sergio he is not wanted or needed. She replies that the decision is hers to make. Asking if Sergio approves of the pay and agrees to live in the palace, she hires him and tells him to remove Fabrizio. He tells Fabrizio to pack his bags and leave. This infuriates Fabrizio, who turns to see Aura looking in. He goes after her. Consuelo tells Sergio to go after him.Seeing the elevator going up, Sergio takes the stairs and ends up in the library, calling for Aura. The lights go out and he looks around, finding a sabré which has been stabbed into the mummified corpse. Muffled screams are heard. As Sergio runs through the darkened library, he sees Fabrizio grab Aura and run out of the room. He chases after them. Hearing them nearby, he pushes away books from a shelf and sees them embracing. Aura reaches out to Sergio, who fights with Fabrizio. In the struggle Fabrizio is killed. When Sergio informs the women he will have to report this accidental death to the police, Consuelo tells him no and to dispose of the body. He insists he will tell but is told that they will testify that he came in and violently attacked them. Sergio realizes they are working together and that he has been used to kill someone they no longer wanted around. Stunned, he offers disbelief. Both women insist that he must do as he is told.Sergio is told to put the body in the trunk of Consuelos car because his is too small. Then he is given a roll of heavy tape and told to do as he was instructed so that the body will not be identifiable. Sergio takes the body to nearby railroad tracks and tapes the arms to the rails, positioning the head so the train will run over it. He hides in the bushes and checks his watch as he waits for the train. A man is seen crossing the tracks with a bicycle. The train roars through and Sergio returns to the palazzo.He tells Aura that everything went as planned and that he is leaving. He will tell no one about this. She professes that she wants him. He tries to leave but is irresistibly drawn to her. Consuelo tells him that now that he has proven his worth, she is able to reveal that Aura is not her daughter.The three are seen eating with Sergio watching. Aura and Consuelo have almost identical hand movements. They rise and look at Sergio. Consuelo says she is cold and for Aura to go and see if a window is open. As she leaves, strange music is heard. Consuelo comments on the music and Sergio calls for Aura. Consuelo pours another cup of the potion tea and drinks it as Sergio comes back into the room. He questions why she drinks it if it is harmful. She begins chanting, saying that it is life. She begins ritual dancing and speaking Italian. He asks where she has sent Aura. The dancing continues and Consuelo tells him to look in the dark. Aura is seen emerging from the shadows and begins a sensual dance. Both women are seen dancing as Sergio watches. Aura begins writhing on her knees until finally Sergio cries out for it to stop. The music stops but Consuelo is not seen. Aura approaches him and they go to Fabrizios bedroom.Sergio tells her he would prefer to go to her bedroom, but she insists that this is her bedroom and that they will be together forever here. Sergio turns and sees Consuelo watching. He angrily tells her to get her ugly face away and stop watching. Aura, undressed and sitting in bed, turns out the light. He tries to turn it back on, but she insists she prefers the dark. She lies down and begins moaning, clutching the bed frame.He wakes the next morning alone in bed. Consuelo tells him that Aura is not there, but that she told her last night how happy she was. She asks Sergio if he is happy and he agrees. She tells him that she is afraid that something will happen to interfere with that happiness. She brings his breakfast on a tray and clothes for him to wear. She tells him that the newspaper reports nothing bad. He is told to begin work in the library that day.Sergio goes outside as the city bells are ringing. Glancing down, he sees Consuelo dragging a cat by a rope around its neck. He goes into the fencing room and finds Aura, kissing her and telling her he missed waking up with her. He says he wants to take her away and leave Consuelo behind. She insists that this is her home and that he will not be able to persuade her otherwise. Saying she misses Fabrizio and his fencing, she tries to get Sergio to fence with her. He refuses and takes away her foil. She draws two epées and gives one to him. He kicks it away and takes hers away from her. They argue over the mention of Fabrizios name, which he never wants to hear again. He slaps her a few times, asking to know the truth. She says she will go away, leaving him alone with Consuelo. He locks the door and demands to know who she really is. She asks for him to let her out. He throws away the key. She runs from door to door but they are all locked. Exhausted, she sinks to the floor and begins twitching. He asks what is wrong. She contorts on the bed and Sergio calls for Consuelo. She tells him to leave her alone and retreats into the closet behind clothes. He calls to her and pulls aside the clothes. Consuelo is revealed. She tells him that she transforms herself into Aura for his pleasure and to give her time.Unbelieving, he runs around the house, calling for Aura. Unable to find her, he goes into the greenhouse and sits to wait. Outside a raging thunderstorm begins. He hears the womans voice calling him. He turns and sees Aura in the distance. She approaches him. Consuelo is also seen, warning him not to imprison Aura again. She must be free to come and go. She bids him come back to the house. Aura says he will be able to see and touch her because the witch wills it to be so.Later he is seen watching a woman hanging clothes on a clothesline and singing. He goes to his desk in the library but pulls his knees up into the chair. Next he is seen praying for strength just as Fabrizio did. Consuelo hears him and tells him he is pathetic. She asks why he doesnt leave and get another job. He answers that he is happy here. He asks if she remembers the last lines her husband wrote. She tells him to return the book to the library. He quotes lines from the journal which tells of his wife having reincarnated someone. Rushing into her room, he tells her the last words of her husband were that he was afraid of her and wanted to know what she had become. What happened to him, Sergio asks her? She tells him that he committed suicide. She asks him to zip her dress and to take some things to the antique store to sell. He begs her to bring back Aura whom he has not seen for several months. He pours a cup of the tea and tries to force her to drink it. She reminds him that only she can bring Aura back and that he should not make her angry.As he is carrying a statue to the antique dealer, Marta pulls up in a car and calls to him. Selling the statue, he is seen collecting the money and going back to the palazzo. Marta tries to question him, but he seems disinterested and wonders how she found him. She says she was just on her way to the antique dealer and saw him. He goes back into the house where Consuelo is leaving. Giving her the money, she remarks how his former friend seems to want him. She says she doesnt know when she will be back and leaves. Marta tries to prevent him from closing the door but is unable.Sulking in the library, he hears Auras laughter and goes to investigate. She is seen lying on a couch. She gets up and tells him it is because of the new man. Sergio looks and sees a new young man (Ivan Rossamov) who has answered a newspaper ad. She tells him to tell the young man to leave, but he insists that it is he who will leave. She tries to persuade him to stay, claiming it is he that she wants. He says that is what he was told when he came there to work. She wants him to tell the new man to go and that he should not believe what Consuelo tells him. When she tells him that she loves him, he tells her to wait.Tying up Consuelos hands, he drags her outside to the iron gate and binds her hands to it with wire. Meanwhile the new man calls for Aura, who disappears into the dark. Sergio brings small palettes and wooden cases to build a fire under the witch. He then pours wine over the wood and lights it. As the witch screams  No!  he sits a short distance away to watch. The young man, having come outside, sees this. In the flames, Consuelos face turns to Aura as Sergio watches her burn.","numvotes":"329","primarytitle":"The Witch"},"color":"rgb(65,97,106)","size":1.0},{"source":"Thriller","target":"tt7445958","id":"6824","attributes":{"productioncompany":"Movierockets Entertainment","countriesoforigin":"Australia","averagerating":"5.5","titletype":"short","originaltitle":"The Sculptor","sex of artist":"male","startyear":"2017","runtimeminutes":"5","sex of killer":"male","role of artist":"killer","numvotes":"15","primarytitle":"The Sculptor"},"color":"rgb(76,84,86)","size":3.0},{"source":"Short","target":"tt7445958","id":"6822","attributes":{"productioncompany":"Movierockets Entertainment","countriesoforigin":"Australia","averagerating":"5.5","titletype":"short","originaltitle":"The Sculptor","sex of artist":"male","startyear":"2017","runtimeminutes":"5","sex of killer":"male","role of artist":"killer","numvotes":"15","primarytitle":"The Sculptor"},"color":"rgb(76,84,86)","size":3.0},{"source":"Drama","target":"tt0839957","id":"6644","attributes":{"productioncompany":"Woolly Head Productions","countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"4.3","titletype":"movie","notes":"\"Voodoo\" motif","originaltitle":"The Promise Keeper","storyline":"2000 Year-Old Myth: The Promise Keeper movie springboards from a 2000 Year-Old myth.

In the morning, Sam is permitted to leave, but Morosini takes his passport because he considers Sam an important witness and must not leave Italy. Morosini tells Sam that they have been three unresolved murders and that a \"dangerous maniac\" is loose in Rome. Sam phones the airport to cancel his airplane reservation and heads back to his apartment. On his way back, someone swings a meat cleaver at his head, but an elderly woman on the street warns him just in time. The black raincoat killer flees before Sam can identify him.Later that day, Sam goes back to the police station to report his attack and he is told that a black-leather glove was found at the crime scene and has been analyzed. Apparently, the attacker was left-handed and a smoker. Sam goes to the hospital to visit the woman who was attacked whom is Monica Ranieri (Eva Renzi), the wife of the gallery\u0027s owner Alberto Ranieri (Umberto Raho). Alberto asks Sam for a cigarette and Sam tosses his pack to Alberto who catches it with his left hand.A few days later, the unseen killer is seeking out additional women to kill by staking out the local racetrack. Meanwhile, Sam and Julia research the previous victims. Sam visits an antique shop where the first victim worked, and the flamboyantly gay owner tells Sam that a painting was sold that night of the woman\u0027s disappearance. The owner lets Sam borrow a black-and-white copy of the painting which consists of a woman being attacked in the snow of a local park.Morosini visits Sam at his home and tells him about the most recent murder and takes him to the police station. There, Morosini returns Sam\u0027s passport. By now, Sam has decided to stay and investigate the killings by himself. Morosini tells Sam that he will have a police detective follow the writer around for protection since the killer now is after him for seeing the attempt on Monica Ranieri. After Sam visits Alberto again at his home near the art gallery, Monica is there having returned home from the hospital and thanks him for saving her life. Next, Sam goes to a local prison where the second victim\u0027s pimp is there serving time where he asks information about the killer.That evening, Sam and Julia are walking down a dark street with the police detective tailing them, a black car appears and runs over the detective. While the black-clad unseen driver heads off, the car\u0027s passenger, a strange-looking man in a yellow jacket (Reggie Nalder) jumps out and pursues the couple with a gun. Julia gets away, but Sam is chased by both the yellow jacket assasin on foot and the black-jacket killer in the black car. After a chase through the streets and a local junkyard, Sam runs out onto a busy street. Sam realizes that the yellow jacket killer will not kill him with witnesses around, Sam then becomes the pursuer. But he loses the yellow jacket assasin who ducks into a hotel meeting room full of yellow jacket men.The next day, Sam visits the pimp in jail again who tells him that he knows a man who can help. Soon after, another man arrives at Sam\u0027s apartment and after he is given money, says he will contact Sam later to find out the idenity of the yellow jacket man who chased him. Then, the killer phones Sam and Julia at their apartment and threatens to kill them. The killer also phones the police station and taunts Morosini with planing to do more killings. Sam and Julia visit the police station where they listen to the recorded phone call where they hear a mysterious creaking sound in the background.The hired man returns to Sam\u0027s apartment and give him the name and address of the yellow-jacketed shooter. Sam goes to the small aparment of \u0027Needles\u0027, but finds the assasin dead from an apparent drug overdose. Later, Sam and Morosini are told by a voice annalyst that Sam\u0027s recorded call and an phone call to the police station placed to Morosini were made by two seperate people. Sam\u0027s friend Carlo hears the background noise and says that it sounds familiar. He takes the tape to listen some more. Meanwhile, the killer strikes again and kills another woman, named Tina, who returns to her apartment after an outing with her boyfriend.When Sam and Julia agree that things have gone too far for them, they make plans to return to America. But the next flight will not be until two days from now. Sam decides to visit the painter of the eerie painting, who lives in a run-down house on the outskirts of Rome. The eccentric artist tells Sam that he witnesses the event of the assault on the girl from over 10 years ago. Back in Rome, Julia is alone in Sam\u0027s apartment when the unseen killer pays her a threatening visit. Sam returns just in time, and Julia is saved, but the killer has already fled yet again.The next day, Carlo arrives where he tells them that he has finally identified the background noise on the tape which is the sound of a rare bird that can only live in Northern Siberia, and the only one that resides in Rome is in the local zoo. Sam and the police arrive at the zoo and realize that it is near the apartment of Alberto and Monica. When they burst into the apartment, the couple are struggling over a knife. When the police intervene, Alberto flees and falls out a window to his death on the street below. As he is dying after the fall, he admits to being the murderer.With the case apparently wraped up, Sam cannot find Julia who had run out of Alberto\u0027s apartment with Carlo and Monica. When Sam tracks them down to a small apartment a few blocks away (the same apartment the killer resides in), he finds Carlo dead and a bound and gagged Julia on the floor. Sam turns around and sees a snickering and wild-eyed Monica holding a knife. At this point, Sam finally remembers what he saw that night: it was not Monica being attacked but it was her husband Alberto trying to stop an attack on HIM! Sam chases Monica through the dark hallways and it leads right back to the art gallery where it all started. Monica drops a heavy sculpture down on Sam, pinning him to the floor. Before she can utilize her knife, the police arrive and subdue Monica.It is revealed by Inspector Morosini that Monica was a victim of a sexual assault and lived with the trauma of it for many years. In a transference-of-guilt, Monica imposed upon herself as the assailent and killed all those women as a way of re-enacting the assault on her and her loyal husband Alberto covered up for her and was the one trying to kill Sam to prevent him from finding out of his wife\u0027s murderous activities. With the case finally wraped up, Sam and Julia fly back to America.","numvotes":"20522","primarytitle":"The Bird with the Crystal Plumage","productioncompany":"Seda Spettacoli","countriesoforigin":"Italy, West Germany","averagerating":"7.1","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"L\u0027uccello dalle piume di cristallo","sex of artist":"male","storyline":"In Italy, American writer Sam Dalmas witnesses a murder attempt on an art-gallery owner, Monica Ranieri, a few days before he\u0027s supposed to return home.

While wealthy, charming, generally intelligent and very handsome, he is naive and easily manipulated. These faults lead to his spiral into sin and, ultimately, misery.While posing for a painting by his artist friend Basil Hallward (Lowell Gilmore), Dorian meets Basil\u0027s friend Lord Henry Wotton (George Sanders). Wotton is enchantingly cynical and witty, and tells Dorian that the only life worth living is one dedicated entirely to pleasure. After Wotton convinces Dorian that youth and beauty will bring him everything he desires, Dorian openly wishes that his portrait could age in his place, and that he could keep his youthful good looks forever. He makes this statement in the presence of a certain Egyptian statue, which supposedly has the power to grant wishes. When the portrait of Dorian is complete, Lord Henry hails it as a masterpiece and is surprised when Basil announces he will never exhibit it because he feels he put \"too much of himself\" into it. Basil is also concerned about Lord Henry\u0027s influence on the impressionable Dorian, who Basil considers a dear friend and an artistic muse. Basil gives the painting to Dorian, who proudly hangs it in his opulent home.One fateful night, Dorian visits a lower-class tavern, The Two Turtles, where he is given a prime seat for the night\u0027s entertainment. He is instantly charmed by the tavern owners\u0027 daughter, Sibyl Vane (Angela Lansbury), who performs a sweet singing routine during the lineup. Dorian is invited backstage after the show to meet Sibyl, and plays the piano for her in the empty tavern. Sibyl is flattered by the attention of such a handsome gentleman, and her mother (Lydia Bilbrook) encourages the relationship because of Dorian\u0027s wealth, but Sibyl\u0027s brother James (Richard Fraser) is suspicious. James tells his enamored sister in private that if this young man, whom Sibyl nicknamed \"Sir Tristan\" after a virtuous knight in Arthurian mythology, ever harms her, he will kill him. James is then deployed to Australia on a sailing mission.Dorian excitedly tells Basil and Lord Henry that he is engaged to the beautiful Sibyl Vane, and invites them to come with him to the tavern to hear her sing. Despite having heard Lord Henry\u0027s disdainful views on marriage, Dorian is so genuinely happy that Lord Henry\u0027s words no longer influence him. Basil sees this as a positive development, and after seeing Sibyl perform and making her acquaintance, encourages the engagement for the sake of Dorian\u0027s moral purity. Lord Henry, on the other hand, cannot resist exploiting his innate ability to influence his friends, and suggests that Dorian test Sibyl\u0027s worth with an \"experiment.\" Dorian invites Sibyl to his house that night and, when she prepares to go home, asks her to stay. Torn between love and honor, Sibyl nearly leaves, but cannot resist Dorian\u0027s charm. This meant that she had failed Lord Henry\u0027s test, and Dorian sends her an incredibly hurtful letter, accusing her of \"killing his love,\" and that she can have no part in his life henceforth. He sends her a sum of money for compensation, but Sibyl is emotionally destroyed.When Dorian returns home after abandoning Sibyl, he notices a slight change in the portrait Basil had painted of him. The mouth looks somehow crueler, and a cold unkindness is present in the face that had not been there before. When he wakes the next morning, the change is still visible. He feels immense guilt over how badly he had treated Sibyl, and hastily composes an apology letter in an attempt to redeem himself. Before he can deliver it, Lord Henry arrives with the news that Sibyl Vane had killed herself the night before. Dorian is initially devastated, but Lord Henry convinces him to not blame himself for the tragedy and invites him to the opera. Abandoning his grief, Dorian falls deeper into Lord Henry\u0027s teachings of \"new hedonism\", and goes to the opera with him that very night. Basil is surprised and worried when he witnesses Dorian\u0027s uncaring behavior in regard to Sibyl\u0027s death, and Dorian plans to dedicate his life solely to his own pleasure. Because the change in the portrait still disturbed him, Dorian has it covered with a screen and locked in his old school room at the top of the house, to which he keeps the only key.Eighteen years later, Dorian is nearing his fortieth birthday, but has not visibly changed since age twenty-two. His friends and neighbors are awestruck at his youthful appearance, but unsavory rumors constantly circulate about his strange behavior and acquaintances. Having taken Lord Henry\u0027s ideas to heart, Dorian\u0027s life consists largely of scandals with women, opium dens, and influencing other wealthy young men to adopt his hedonistic way of living. Over time, many of his friends lost their good standing in society, and women were shamed to be in his company. Dorian meets Basil again, who is preparing to catch a train to Paris, and invites him to his house. Basil expresses his concern about Dorian\u0027s behavior, and admits that in order to truly know what kind of man Dorian is, he would have to see his soul itself. Dorian grimly leads Basil up to the old school room to look upon his handiwork for the first time in eighteen years. Dorian removes the coverings from the hidden portrait, and Basil is horrified to see that the man in the painting has warped into a hideous, demon-like creature to reflect Dorian\u0027s multitude of sins. Basil begs Dorian to repent and change his ways, but Dorian feels a surge of anger toward Basil, blaming him for his miserable life because the painting was his own work. Dorian stabs Basil to death and locks his body in the school room with the horrible painting, in which blood has appeared on the hands of the twisted painted Dorian.The next morning, Dorian summons a former friend, Allen Campbell (Douglas Walton), whose reputation had since been ruined by his associations with Dorian. Campbell is a scientist specializing in anatomy and chemistry, and Dorian blackmails the highly reluctant man into disposing of Basil\u0027s body. The nature of the blackmailing subject is not revealed, but Campbell agrees to disintegrate Basil\u0027s body, and departs afterward looking shaken and disturbed.Basil\u0027s disappearance is talked about in London society for some time, but Dorian is never suspected. Among the few who have remained his loyal friends are Lord Henry and Gladys (Donna Reed), Basil\u0027s niece, who was a little girl when the portrait was painted. Dorian enters a romance with Gladys, though he is apprehensive about the effect he appears to have on the lives of those he becomes close to. He visits a seedy inn one evening and finds a former friend, Adrian Singleton (Morton Lowry), a wealthy young man who had been ruined by following Dorian\u0027s influence. Adrian is now a disheveled opium addict, but he knows of Dorian\u0027s sordid past and mockingly addresses him as \"Sir Tristan\" as Dorian departs the inn. The nickname is overheard by James Vane, Sibyl\u0027s brother, who happened to be at the inn and had spent eighteen years being hell-bent on avenging his sister. Though he did not know her cruel suitor\u0027s name and had never seen his face, the name \"Sir Tristan\" is enough to motivate him to follow Dorian outside and threaten him. Dorian calmly denies ever knowing a Sibyl Vane, and asserts that he is too young to have had anything to do with a death that occurred eighteen years before. James Vane admits that this man looks too young to be the suspect, and releases him. Adrian Singleton, with both amusement and resentment, explains to James that Dorian Gray was the man he sought, and that he had not looked a day older than twenty-two for the past eighteen years. Enraged, James Vane begins to track down Dorian Gray.A few days later, Dorian attends a hunting party with several society friends. The sport is interrupted when a man, assumed to be a beater, is shot to death by accident after hiding in the bushes unseen. It is revealed to Dorian later that the dead man was not a beater, but James Vane, having followed Dorian in revenge and lost his own life in the process. Dorian feels even more guilty and cursed, but wishes to make one final stab at having a good and worthwhile life. He soon proposes marriage to Gladys, who happily accepts, much to the displeasure of her friend David Stone (Peter Lawford), who is one of the many who are suspicious of Dorian.Despite his happiness about his upcoming marriage to Gladys, Dorian is weighted down by the deaths of Sibyl, Basil, and James, as well as the ruin of Adrian Singleton and others like him. The last straw is the news that Allen Campbell, whom Dorian ruined and then blackmailed into disposing of Basil\u0027s body, had killed himself in misery. Dorian realizes that the one noble thing he can possibly do is to spare Gladys from the certain misfortune he will bring her.At long last, Dorian ventures up to the school room to face the painting that is the embodiment of his corrupted soul. Using the same knife with which he had murdered Basil Hallward, he stabs his painted figure through the heart. Dorian himself feels the effect of the knife, and collapses, praying for his salvation. Roused by his screams, his houseguests, including Gladys, David, and Lord Henry, rush upstairs and find Dorian Gray\u0027s dead body on the school room floor, now in the form of the hideous creature from the painting. The painting itself, with the knife still protruding from it, has reverted to its original image of the handsome, innocent youth than Dorian once was. Lord Henry, stricken, sees the horrible results of his own influence and gazes at Dorian\u0027s corpse in shocked remorse.","numvotes":"12975","primarytitle":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","productioncompany":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM)","countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"7.5","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","sex of artist":"male","storyline":"In 1886, in Victorian London, the corrupt Lord Henry Wotton (George Sanders) meets the pure Dorian Gray (Hurd Hatfield) posing for talented painter Basil Hallward (Lowell Gilmore).

When Gordon is taking his girlfriend\u0027s picture in Hong Kong, several Caucasian thugs led by a Chinese man, Kogan, threaten her, so he beats them up. Elsewhere, Bernard Wong pays his workers extra money to continue digging his land after discovering human bones. The thugs are members of the Black Ninja Clan, whose dead are buried on Wong\u0027s site. One of their operatives strangles Gordon\u0027s girlfriend, believing she knows where Gordon has hidden the Golden Ninja statue that apparently gives him power and won\u0027t say, while another hires Ghost Ninja, a beautiful witch dressed in white to kill Wong, his daughter Fanny, her husband George, and her son, Bobo, for three million dollars. Fanny is frightened by a cat in the house upon move-in, and the Black Ninja leader keeps swinging her sword to hallucinate frogs jumping to their deaths out of her refrigerator and her soup ladle turning into a flying snake (strung on a wire that is highly visible without pausing despite being a split-second shot). The witch keeps spooking Fanny and Bobo, who insists on riding his bike in the living room, but George doesn\u0027t believe either of them. Gordon (sitting in front of a poster of a strangled woman marked \"this could happen to you\" and another poster of a swimsuit model) responds to their complaints (in shot-reverse shot, as they\u0027re obviously not in the same film) and commands Magic Chan, a wizard with a magic mirror he has forgotten, and his obese sidekick, Firecracker, in the same manor, and frequently keeps in touch on the phone after his Caucasian operative living next door, Sara, is murdered by a zombie man. Sometimes he uses a black phone, but more often it is a Garfield phone (which the camera moves and music suggest is supposed to be funny). The Ghost Ninja is more interested in her own desires than killing the family, and masturbates to the couple\u0027s lovemaking before spiriting herself into Fanny\u0027s vagina (there is no full-frontal nudity) in order to lure George away from her, though she makes him physically ill, as she did to Bobo by stuffing his mouth full of handfuls of grass. The Ghost Ninja, once compelled by the Black Ninja leader, calls upon more women like dressed her, plus one impersonating Bobo\u0027s grandmother as a lure for him, and the zombie man, in an all-out assault against the family, while the two bumbling idiots (Firecracker and Magic Chan) are having a drinking contest, and Gordon, in a red ninja suit, who has been offing the Caucasian ninjas, prepares to confront Kogan, the Black Ninja leader. —Scott Andrew Hutchins \u003cscottandrewhutchins@yahoo.com\u003e","startyear":"1988","runtimeminutes":"92","sex of killer":"female","numvotes":"197","primarytitle":"Diamond Ninja Force"},"color":"rgb(82,77,74)","size":1.0},{"source":"Crime","target":"tt0052655","id":"6988","attributes":{"notes":"The artist takes revenge on critics; comedy or satire","runtimeminutes":"66","sex of killer":"male","synopsis":"At the Yellow Door café, a popular hangout for the beatnik crowd in Venice, California, busboy Walter Paisley (Dick Miller) is deeply impressed by Maxwell H. Brock\u0027s spontaneous poetry recital. Despite the poet\u0027s open disdain for his simplistic, gullible nature, Walter clings to Maxwell\u0027s words and admires his associates, especially sketch artist Carla (Barbour Morris). Unknown to the customers and Yellow Door owner Leonard De Santis, two undercover police officers, Art Lacroix and Lou Raby, take turns staking out the café for possible drug deals.After his shift ends, Walter returns to his small apartment frustrated over his inability to convince the Yellow Door patrons of his artistic potential. When his attempt at sculpting proves futile, Walter lashes out angrily at his landlady\u0027s cat and accidentally kills the animal. At first horrified, Walter then covers the cat\u0027s body with clay and the next day presents it to Leonard and Carla as a work of art.Amazed by the realistic quality of the \"sculpture,\" Leonard displays the cat in the café and that evening Walter is showered with praise by the Yellow Door regulars, including Maxwell. One customer, Naolia, is so moved by the work that she offers Walter a small vial as a gift. Lou notices the exchange and, following Walter home, asks to see the vial and discovers it contains heroin. Walter is surprised and confused when Lou reveals his identity and demands to know the name of his dealer. Frightened when Lou pulls a gun and places him under arrest, Walter lashes out with a frying pan, splitting Lou\u0027s skull. Meanwhile at the café, Leonard is closing up when he accidentally knocks over Walter\u0027s cat sculpture and to his horror, discovers fur underneath the clay.The next afternoon when Walter returns to work, Leonard makes sarcastic remarks to him about his artistic talent, but Carla and Maxwell come to his defense. Emboldened, Walter reveals he has a new work to show them, entitled \"Murdered Man,\" which stuns Leonard. On his way to telephone the authorities, however, Leonard is approached by a wealthy art collector who offers five hundred dollars for the cat sculpture. Leonard warily agrees, then later goes with Carla to Walter\u0027s apartment to see the new work, which is Lou\u0027s body covered with clay. Shocked, Leonard refuses to display the work at the Yellow Door, but when Carla and Walter express puzzlement, Leonard suggests Walter make other pieces in order to put together a show. The distressed café owner encourages Walter to move away from realism and try \"free form\" art, then pays him fifty dollars from the cat sculpture sale.Ecstatic by his newfound success, Walter ceases working at the Yellow Door, and, affecting a beatnik style, becomes one of the café\u0027s customers, where he joins Maxwell\u0027s table of artists. One afternoon soon after Walter\u0027s initial success, Alice, a part-time model who has been out of town, joins the group but is critical of Walter, whom she knows only as a busboy. Offended by Alice\u0027s put-downs, Walter departs, but later follows her home to ask her to pose for him. Alice agrees and goes to Walter\u0027s apartment, where he strangles her with a scarf, then makes another \"sculpture\" that he takes to the café the next day.Profoundly affected by Walter\u0027s abilities, Maxwell delivers a poetic homage to him that night at the Yellow Door. After a drunken, boisterous night of acclaim, Walter heads for home, but grows frightened at the notion that his fame might be short-lived. Spotting a man cutting wood at a lumber mill, Walter attacks the man and cuts his head off with a large table saw. The next day, Leonard is mortified when Walter brings in his newest work, the bust of a man, and pleads with him to stop sculpting, declaring they have enough pieces for a show. Walter agrees and Leonard sends out invitations for his exhibition.On the night of the show, Walter takes Carla aside and proposes, but Carla insists that while she admires Walter\u0027s works, she is not in love with him. Angered and hurt, Walter asks Carla if she will pose for him later and she agrees. At the show, Walter, distressed over Carla\u0027s rejection, ignores the renowned art critics admiring his work. A little later, Carla closely examines Alice\u0027s sculpture and is terrified when some melting clay reveals a real finger. Carla confronts Walter who quotes Maxwell\u0027s poetry and insists he has only immortalized worthless people. Appalled, Carla flees from the café and Walter follows. Meanwhile, Art has also examined some sculptures and, realizing they are dead bodies, pursues Walter. Maxwell and several of his friends also discover the truth behind the sculptures and run after Walter.Haunted by the voices of his victims who assure him that he will be reviled now that he has been discovered, Walter abandons chasing Carla and instead rushes home in fright. When Art, Maxwell, Carla and the others arrive at the apartment, they find that Walter has hanged himself in despair.","numvotes":"6798","primarytitle":"A Bucket of Blood","productioncompany":"Alta Vista Productions","countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"6.7","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"A Bucket of Blood","sex of artist":"male","storyline":"Walter Paisley, nerdy busboy at a Bohemian café, is jealous of the talent (and popularity) of its various artistic regulars.

However, Susan refuses to leave with Cora and runs back into the cemetery, where she discovers the Nomed mausoleum. As the gate springs open, she enters, finding herself surrounded by green fog and the sound of thunder. When a tramp wanders in behind her, Susan\u0027s eyes turn luminous green and a mysterious man in a robe hits the tramp with some kind of spell. The tramp staggers from the structure with smoke and flames emanating from his face, resulting his head exploding. Susan kneels before the tomb and touches it, causing the lid to open and a claw-like hand to reach out.Twenty years later, psychiatrist Dr. Simon Andrews (Norman Burton) assures Cora that her ongoing concerns about Susan (Bobbie Bresee) are unfounded. Cora counters by handing Simon her father\u0027s history of the Nomed family, which describes a 300-year-old family curse. Simon dismisses the story as superstition, ignoring Cora\u0027s insistence that she has witnessed similarly erratic behavior in both her late sister and her niece. Despite Simon\u0027s skepticism, he reads the book, which explains how a demon \"broke free of the crown of thorns\" and now possesses the body of the firstborn daughter to each generation of Nomeds. It also states that the demon can only be cast out by reuniting it with the crown of thorns, which adorns the gate of the mausoleum.That evening, Susan\u0027s husband, Oliver Farrell (Marjoe Gortner), awakens her from a nap and offers to take her dancing to a nightclub, as their gardener, Ben (Maurice Sherbanee), watches with interest through a window. Shortly after arriving at the nightclub, Oliver is called back to his office, and the couple is followed to the exit by a drunken man, who is enamored by Susan. Offended by the man\u0027s rudeness, Susan follows him with her glowing green eyes and causes his car to burst into flames once he is inside. Oliver tries to rescue the man, but is unable to open the car doors. The drunken man burns to death inside his car.Ben appears at the Farrell home the next day and flirts openly with Susan while her husband is at work. She responds in kind, and their ensuing sexual encounter concludes with Susan using a garden claw to kill and mutilate Ben. The following morning, Cora arrives at the house, asking for Susan\u0027s signature on some estate papers. The demon overtakes Susan and uses powers of telekinesis to levitate Cora off the the floor and makes her torso split open, killing her as well.Oliver is unaware of his wife\u0027s alter ego until later that night, when he awakens to find Susan asleep in a rocking chair, bearing the demon\u0027s face. He telephones Simon, who maintains his skepticism and offers an appointment for the next day. Susan returns to normal, but Oliver is unable to sleep.In the morning, he asks Elsie (LaWanda Page), the maid, to look after Susan until he returns in the early afternoon. However, the green fog and pulsating light that surround Susan only encourage the maid to pack her suitcase and leave, never to return.Although Susan tells her husband that nothing is wrong, she keeps her appointment with Simon. The psychiatrist places her under hypnosis and records the session, during which the demon reveals itself. Afterward, Simon plays the tape for his colleague, Dr. Roni Logan (Sheri Mann), a specialist in the paranormal, who convinces him of Susan\u0027s demonic possession.Meanwhile, Susan invites a delivery boy (Chu Chu Malave) into her home with the promise of sex, but she transforms into the demon and uses powers to telekinesis to split his skull, killing him too.The next day, Simon informs Oliver of Susan\u0027s condition and instructs him to avoid close contact with her until the crown of thorns has been retrieved. That afternoon, Susan goes to a local shopping mall where she steals a painting from an art gallery. When the salesman pursues her, she uses her demon powers to levitate him high above the floor, then allows him to drop onto a conical metal sculpture on the ground level.Upon his return home, Oliver expresses dislike for the painting, which features a centaur and bare-breasted women. The tension between the couple continues through dinner, but Oliver later apologizes to Susan while she is taking a bubble bath, and she climbs from the tub to embrace him. A thunderstorm rages outside as Simon removes the crown of thorns from the mausoleum gate, and Susan tightens her embrace until it crushes Oliver\u0027s body (her bare breasts turn into two individual demon heads which their mouths filled with sharp teeth disembowel Oliver).Simon arrives at the house a little later to find Oliver dead in the bathtub and Susan playing with dolls in the attic. As Susan reminisces about her childhood, Simon places the crown of thorns on her head, removing the demon from her body and returning it to the cemetery. Simon and Susan arrive at the mausoleum, where they find the creature sprawled over the tomb. At the urging of Simon, Susan places the crown on the demon\u0027s head, and the tomb opens, trapping the monster inside as the sun rises outside.Susan emerges from the experience in a state of bewilderment, and Simon promises to explain everything over time (refusing to tell her about Oliver\u0027s fate). Before leaving the cemetery, Simon tells the caretaker (the same robed being from earlier), \"You\u0027ve known this secret and lived with it, like your father before you and his father before him,\" reminding him that no one is to enter the mausoleum. As Simon and Susan drive away, the caretaker reveals himself to be Ben, the gardener. He looks at the camera, breaking the fourth wall, and laughs.","numvotes":"2468","primarytitle":"Mausoleum"},"color":"rgb(76,80,97)","size":1.0},{"source":"Crime","target":"tt0038621","id":"7004","attributes":{"notes":"The artist takes revenge on critics","runtimeminutes":"65","sex of killer":"male","numvotes":"1024","primarytitle":"House of Horrors","productioncompany":"Universal Pictures","countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"6.1","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"House of Horrors","sex of artist":"male","storyline":"Marcel De Lange is a struggling sculptor whose work and sanity are derided by the New York art critics.

Shortly after defeating the evil entity known as Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard), the Losers Club - Bill Denbrough (Jaeden Martell), Ben Hanscom (Jeremy Ray Taylor), Beverly Marsh (Sophia Lillis), Richie Tozier (Finn Wolfhard), Eddie Kaspbrak (Jack Dylan Grazer), Stanley Uris (Wyatt Olef), and Mike Hanlon (Chosen Jacobs) - gather as Bev tells the boys about the vision she saw of all of them as adults when she faced Pennywise. The Losers make a blood pact to return to Derry in the event that they must face IT once more.27 years later in 2016, a gay couple - Adrian Mellon (Xavier Dolan) and Don Hagarty (Taylor Frey) - are enjoying a night out at the carnival when they are harassed by homophobic thugs. Even as they walk away from the carnival, the thugs follow them and start to viciously assault them. They throw Adrian over the bridge and flee into the night. Adrian almost drowns until he is pulled out of the water... except the one who pulled him out was Pennywise. Don watches in horror as the monster clown grabs Adrian and takes a huge bite out of his chest. Mike (now played by Isiah Mustafa) overhears a report of the incident over a police scanner, and when he arrives at the scene, he discovers the message \"COME HOME\" written in blood on the side of the bridge. Mike knows that IT has returned.We catch up with the other Losers in adulthood. Bill (now played by James McAvoy) is married to Audra (Jess Weixler) and has found success as an author/screenwriter, but he is frequently told that his endings are not good. Eddie (now played by James Ransone) is a risk assessor who is married to a woman, Myra (Mollie Atkinson), who is just as controlling as his own mother. Ben (now played by Jay Ryan) has slimmed down and is a successful architect, though he lives alone. Richie (now played by Bill Hader) is a stand-up comedian. Stanley (now played by Andy Bean) is a partner in an accounting firm. Bev (now played by Jessica Chastain) is a fashion designer, married to the abusive Tom Rogan (Will Beinbrink). Mike calls everyone, and they do not immediately recognize his voice until he mentions he is from Derry. Everybody becomes slightly unnerved by the phone call, and Mike beckons them to return to Derry. Bev tells Tom that she will be returning to Derry to visit friends, but he is paranoid and thinks she is lying to him and is cheating on him since he heard Mike\u0027s name. Tom starts to hit Bev until she fights back and runs away from their home. The other guys start to make their way back to Derry. The only one who doesn\u0027t go is Stanley, as he commits suicide by slitting his wrists in the tub rather than facing the nightmare from his childhood again.A flashback shows that psychotic bully Henry Bowers (Nicholas Hamilton) survived being pushed down the well by Mike and had washed out of the sewers. When he returned home, police arrested him after they came across the body of Henry\u0027s father and deduced that he murdered him. Today, Henry (now played by Teach Grant) is in a mental institution and has become even more insane. He is visited by Pennywise in the form of a zombified Patrick Hockstetter (Owen Teague), who presents Henry with his old knife.The Losers meet at the Jade of the Orient restaurant and catch up after a long absence. They joke and reminisce, but also note Stanley\u0027s absence. They start to split fortune cookies, only to each get single word fortunes that they realize form a full message. Bev\u0027s fortune reads \"Stanley\", and put together, the fortunes read \"Guess Stanley Could Not Cut It\". The Losers know that Pennywise has found them. The fortune cookies then start to crack open and reveal hideous little spider-like creatures. The Losers bash at them on the table, which only makes them look crazy when others see them attacking a table. Outside the restaurant, Bev calls Stanley\u0027s wife. Before she can say what happened, Bev knows that Stanley was found in a bathtub, and the other guys figure what happened to him.Everyone gathers at the hotel where they are staying, and Mike confesses that this is the real reason he summoned everyone back to Derry. They ask Bev how she knew how Stanley died, and she says she has seen how they all die, as she was the only one who saw the Deadlights when Pennywise captured her. Bill goes back to Mike\u0027s house, where Mike drugs Bill\u0027s water to cause him to experience a trippy vision. Mike explains that in all the time he has stayed in Derry, he has studied the history of IT and learned from a Native American tribe of the Ritual of Chud, which can be performed to destroy IT once and for all. He produces a ritualistic piece of pottery with a depiction of the ritual. They bring it back to the other Losers, and Mike explains that they need to gather artifacts from their childhood and place it in the pottery so that they can destroy Pennywise.Somewhere else in Derry, we see a little girl named Victoria (Ryan Kiera Armstrong) at a football game with her mom. Victoria is lured away by a firefly, and she follows it under the bleachers until she meets Pennywise. He uses the same manipulative trick on her to make her think he is playful, and he appeals to her sympathy when he cries about not having friends, as Victoria is made fun of for a birthmark on her cheek. Pennywise promises to make it go away, only to end up devouring Victoria.The Losers go to an old clubhouse that Ben built for them over the summer they all became friends. There, they find an artifact for Stanley, which is a shower cap. A flashback shows them as kids with Stanley asking if they will all remain friends as adults. His friends assured him that they would be.The gang splits up as they head back to their homes in Derry. Bev goes to her old home and meets the elderly Mrs. Kersh (Joan Gregson). She invites Bev inside for tea and cookies as Bev looks around. She finds an old pack of cigarettes, as well as the poem that Ben wrote for her, although she still thinks it was written by Bill. As Bev sits with Mrs. Kersh, the old woman displays unusual behavior. Bev notices what looks like rotted flesh on Mrs. Kersh\u0027s chest. She mentions to Bev that her father joined the circus. Bev sees what looks like a human Pennywise in an old picture. Mrs. Kersh then asks Bev if she is \"daddy\u0027s little girl,\" as her father had called her. The old woman is then revealed to be Pennywise as she takes on a grotesque and monstrous form that chases Bev out. Before Bev gets away, she sees Pennywise in his human form as \"Bob Gray\", who wears his clown makeup and scratches the red lines on his face to taunt Bev.Richie goes to an old arcade he went to as a kid where he picks up a token as his artifact. In a flashback, he is seen playing a game with Henry\u0027s cousin, and the bully teases Richie for being a \"fairy\". Adult Richie is then found and tormented by Pennywise, who claims to know his \"dirty little secret.\" He takes on the form of a Paul Bunyan statue and tries to attack Richie, but he gets away in time.Bill goes to an antique shop and sees that his old bike is on sale. He asks the shop owner (played by none other than Stephen King) if he can buy the bike. The owner knows of Bill\u0027s work, but agrees that his endings suck. Bill gets the bike and rides around his old street, passing the sewer where Georgie (Jackson Robert Scott) was taken. Pennywise taunts Bill with an apparition of Georgie calling to him from the sewers. Bill is almost lured in by the monster clown. As he rides away, he sees a kid named Dean (Luke Roessler), whom the gang had seen at the restaurant because he is a fan of Richie\u0027s stand-up. Dean has also seen Pennywise lately after Bill had mentioned it. He firmly orders Dean to get himself and his family out of Derry as soon as possible.Ben gets an old yearbook page, in which Bev was the only one to write for him. He is haunted by a flashback to his childhood where Pennywise took on Bev\u0027s form to ridicule Ben for his weight, as Pennywise knew that Ben loved Bev, and he still harbors feelings for her to this day. Her form\u0027s head took fire as Ben hid in a locker, only for Pennywise to be in there with him.Eddie goes to the pharmacy where he would pick up his medications. Creepy Mr. Keene (Joe Bostick) and Gretta (Juno Rinaldi) still work there. Eddie gets an inhaler before he is haunted by Pennywise in the form of his mother being attacked by the Leper (Javier Botet).Henry kills a guard and escapes the institution. He finds the Losers and attacks Eddie by stabbing him in the cheek. He manages to pull the knife out and stab Henry in the chest, albeit non-fatally, and he runs to his friends for help. However, Henry gets away again before he is caught.In another Pennywise haunting, Bill sees the message \"The fun is just beginning\" written, which is what Dean said to Richie at the restaurant, itself a line from Richie\u0027s stand-up. Bill knows that Pennywise is referring to Dean, and he goes to a carnival to try and save the boy after learning he will be there. Bill follows Dean into a hall of mirrors, but Dean just thinks Bill is a crazy weirdo. The two are then found by Pennywise, who bares his long tongue and razor-sharp teeth. Bill desperately tries to kick the glass out to save Dean, but Pennywise breaks through first and brutally attacks the boy, blocking Bill\u0027s view. Bill can only watch in horror as he fails to save the boy.Mike is in the library where Henry finds him and attacks him. Not long after, Richie comes and kills Henry by stabbing him in the back of the head. This causes Richie to puke.Bill reunites with his friends and vows to kill IT himself. His friends gather their artifacts and they join him at the Neibolt House to face off the evil entity for the last time. While there, they make it into Pennywise\u0027s lair and use the pottery to begin the ritual. The Losers throw in their artifacts, being Bev\u0027s poem, Ben\u0027s yearbook page, Richie\u0027s token, Eddie\u0027s inhaler, the boat that Bill helped make with Georgie, and a rock that Mike recovered from their rock war with the Bowers gang. The Deadlights appear and sink into the pottery with the artifacts, but just when it seems that things worked, out rises a red balloon that produces Pennywise. He faces the Losers again in his true form, as a monstrous spider that still carries his clown face, and he states how he has waited so long to see them again. Mike then reveals that the ritual never worked, and the tribe that attempted it on Pennywise got killed themselves. He splits the Losers up with more nightmare visions, including one of Stanley\u0027s severed head as a spider.Eddie and Richie find themselves in a similar scenario to when they were kids as Pennywise places three doors with \"Scary\", \"Very Scary\", and \"Not Scary At All\" for them to walk through. They see the severed half of Betty Ripsom\u0027s body, as well as a small Pomeranian that morphs into a monster. Meanwhile, Ben and Bev are trapped and split from each other, and Pennywise tries to kill Ben by having him sink into the earth while Bev is trapped in an illusion of a bathroom stall where he is harassed by the forms of Mr. Keene, Gretta, Henry, and her own father. Bev fights back against the visions and manages to pull Ben out from sinking, and she realizes he is the one who wrote her the poem as he had recited it as he was almost dying.Bill is trapped in what looks like his childhood basement. He sees his young self talking to Georgie, as the image of the little boy blames Bill for lying on the day that he died, as Bill had pretended to be sick so he wouldn\u0027t go out to play with Georgie in the rain. This had haunted Bill for years, and Pennywise knew he blamed himself for it. Young Bill goes to his adult self with a nail gun, but Adult Bill forgives himself and shoots the apparition instead.The Losers get close enough to fight Pennywise, with Eddie managing to muster up the courage to strike Pennywise himself. As he runs to Richie, however, Pennywise impales Eddie with one of his talons. The Losers try to seek a way out of there, and they figure that since Pennywise is a spider, he can make himself small to try and go after them. They then quickly realize that the only way to make him small enough to defeat him is to force him to believe he is small. They begin to yell at Pennywise and call out all of his otherwise harmless forms before he starts to shrink and shrivel into a powerless shell of his former self. This allows the Losers to pull his heart out of his chest and crush it, destroying him for good. The lair begins to crumble and collapse around them. Richie tries to get Eddie out, but he is already dead. The Losers escape the house and watch as it collapses on itself.The remaining five head to the quarry where they all swam as children. They think about Eddie and how he would have hated it since it\u0027s so dirty. Richie then starts to cry for his fallen friend, and the others console him. As they continue to swim, Ben and Bev share a kiss. As they later walk home, they see their reflections on a window and see their childhood selves, including Eddie and Stanley. One last flashback shows the group as kids riding their bikes home.Later on, Bill has gone back to work with writing, and he feels his endings are getting better. He speaks on the phone to Mike, who is thinking about finally seeing the rest of the world. They tell one another that they love each other, and Mike mentions a letter that all the Losers have been getting. Bill finds his letter and sees that it\u0027s from Stanley, written before his suicide. We hear his voice reading the letter over a small montage of the other Losers in the present. Ben and Bev are now in a relationship, while Richie goes to a bridge where he carved his and Eddie\u0027s initials, revealing that he was in love with him. Stanley\u0027s letter states that he knew he could never be brave enough to face Pennywise again, so he removed himself from the equation to give his friends a chance to honor him, which would give them the strength to fight IT. He turned out to be right.The film concludes with Mike driving away and finally leaving Derry.","numvotes":"245218","primarytitle":"It Chapter Two"},"color":"rgb(92,73,83)","size":1.0},{"source":"craft","target":"tt0385993","id":"6927","attributes":{"runtimeminutes":"89","sex of killer":"male","numvotes":"456","primarytitle":"Rojo sangre","productioncompany":"Canonigo Films","countriesoforigin":"Spain","averagerating":"5.5","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"Rojo sangre","sex of artist":"male","storyline":"Veteran actor Pablo Thevenet has no luck: His daughter has been murdered, his wife has left him, he finds no job and his agent wants to leave him - current directors will never give him a role.

Right after this event, George (Jerry Levitan)and his thug (-----------------) show up to threaten Lionel, because he owes them 200 dollars, presumably for rent. They are going to cut his fingers but Ed Reid, who had hidden himself and tried to stay out of it, makes some noise and is seen. Ed ends up paying Lionel\u0027s debt with a cheque, and the thug requests that he signs an autograph for him, as Ed Reid is quite a famous writer. Next week, Lionel will have to pay again. Lionel is a bit hurt, but he is more worried about not speaking to Ed than anything else. Lionel says that he will give him his money back soon.Back home, Clara calls him on. He tells him off, because he is constantly messing everything up. Clara is crazy for having a perfect carpet. Her attitude is totally opposite when Ed tells her that he won\u0027t be able to pay rent that week. She tells him not to worry about that, because she loves the sexy way he writes. She also flirts with him, and shows him kinky underwear and a whip. She wants him to describe her aloud. She likes it, but she wants some more, to be described as he describes Laura, the sexy flight attendant. She insists in being described later on, and tells him that they are arguing about the rent. Ed says that he only writes filthy stories because it is better than working at McDonald\u0027s.Doc Clapton (Russ Tamblyn) takes Ed to a par, and he introduces him to some poor homeless people who are being fed.

There is the presence of a monster who sets the caretaker on fire inside the ruins. Ed is ashamed about writing cheap porn, but Lynn appreciates that he is imaginative. She comes from a broken home,with two psycho ex-boyfriends. Ed asks her to keep him informed when she falls in love with him. He shakes her hand and kisses her softly. Lynn admits that he had fun and will meet him the following day. Ed celebrates like a child.The monster helps Ed to finish his sculpture. This seems to bring to life another monster. Clara sees that Lionel has stained her carpet again. Lionel is giving life to more gargoyles. Ed puts on loud music and starts to write. Clara enters Lionel\u0027s flat and sees weird sculptures made of blood. A gargoyle is watching her. She faces Lionel about the mess in the apartment.

Another scene has Lionel going crazy.Doc gives Lionel some lemon fizzy drink as an experiment. Lionel throws up blood and clay - that is the material for creating the little devils. There was a little part of his brain that the gargoyles haven\u0027t taken over because Lionel hid it, albeit showing it in the recorded message at the computer. The lemon fizzy drink kills the gargoyle. One of the ones which crawl through the ventilation shaft gets killed like that. They kill the gargoyle stabbed to the wall and the one enclosed in a metallic container with lemon fizzy drink.

That night, a strong wind blows a bottle of water over onto the rock, which begins to bubble and smolder. The next day, the head of the geological office, Dave Miller, returns to town from a business trip and finds the office destroyed by a huge growth of black rock and Ben dead, in a rock-hard, apparently petrified state. Meanwhile, Dave\u0027s girl friend, schoolteacher Cathy Barrett, brings her students to the desert, where little Ginny Simpson pockets a piece of the black rock, later washing it in a basin outside her parents\u0027 farm. In town, Doctor Reynolds performs an autopsy on Ben, but when he cannot explain Ben\u0027s rigidity, he informs Dave and Police Chief Dan Corey that he is shipping the body to a specialist. Martin returns to the demolished office with Dave, and there recognizes the rock formations as resembling the piece of black rock Ben had been examining. Cathy joins them and, also recognizing the rock, races with the men to the Simpson farm. They find it in ruins under a pile of black rock, and Ginny\u0027s parents dead. The girl, however, is in a catatonic state, and they rush her to the care of specialist Dr. Steve Hendricks, at the California Medical Research Center. He soon reports that she is slowly turning to stone, and posits that her only hope of survival lies with identifying the black rock within the next eight hours. Dave brings the rock to his old professor, Arthur Flanders, who assumes that it is from a meteor. Together they visit the Simpson farm, where Arthur notices a discoloration in the ground and deduces that the rock is draining silicon from whatever it touches, including humans. They then go to the desert, where they trace fragments of the rock to a huge meteor. Fretting that the meteor contains billions of years worth of space secrets, which they have only hours to discover, Dave sends the new information to Steve, who prepares a synthetic silicon solution and injects it into Ginny. While a storm brews outside, Dave and Arthur continue to investigate what causes the rock to grow, and after a piece of rock falls into the sink and begins to bubble, they realize that water is the culprit. Noticing the rain, they drive to the desert, where the small pieces of rock are mixing with water to form huge monoliths that rise from the earth and then crash into hundreds of pieces, each becoming another monolith. They report their findings to Dan, who plans to evacuate the town, even though the weather bureau reports that the rain will soon stop. At the hospital, Ginny finally stirs, and Dave deduces that Steve\u0027s silicon solution can be used to control the rocks. Soon, however, more locals are rushed to hospital in the throes of the petrification process, and the rock continues to grow. With little time to announce their findings to the town, Dave and Dan turn to Martin to round up the paperboys and spread the word. The governor soon declares a state of emergency, and Dave and Arthur struggle to convert the formula to one that will retard the rock growth, failing until they realize that the key lies in the simple saline solution Steve used on Ginny. While casualties mount, Dave figures out a way to dynamite the local dam and flood the nearby salt flats, thus creating a large supply of salty water near the canyon edge. Knowing that they must halt the rock\u0027s growth at the canyon edge or lose all hope of survival, Dave ignores the governor\u0027s refusal to give permission to the risky project, and sets up dynamite stations around the dam. Arthur doubts that the water will be able to absorb enough salt for the plan to work, but Martin cites hopeful statistics he has learned from years of reporting on the salt flats, and the team is cheered by his certainty. With only minutes left until the monoliths reach the canyon edge, Dan orders the dynamite to be detonated, and the group watches in fear as the water flows over the monoliths. The plan at first seems to fail, but finally the rock growth slows, and Dan holds Cathy as the last huge formation crashes to a standstill.","numvotes":"3150","primarytitle":"The Monolith Monsters"},"color":"rgb(92,73,83)","size":1.0},{"source":"special connection","target":"tt7584314","id":"6819","attributes":{"productioncompany":"Terra Studio","countriesoforigin":"Russia","averagerating":"6.8","titletype":"short","notes":"Cursed film trope","originaltitle":"Stalin.exe","storyline":"Young guy wanted to watch the curse file named \"stalin.exe\".

A sign in front of the house gives its name as \"High Hopes.\"The film is based on the book of the same title, by Jay Anson, published in 1977. (Anson did not work extensively with the couple, but worked from hours of taped conversations between George and Kathy, which they had turned over to him.)The home features the Dutch gambrel (barn-shaped) roof design, and a pair of quarter-circle windows, on the end, on the 3rd floor, up near the roof. These are illuminated to look like the home\u0027s eyes. Filmmakers modified a house in New Jersey to look like the actual home in Amityville, and it is surprisingly close.It is a documented fact that a troubled young man, 28, had shot his entire family to death in the house, on 11/13/1974, including father, mother, two brothers and two sisters. Thus, in the film, the history of the house allows the Lutz\u0027s, in the fall of 1975, to make an offer of $80,000 on the home, which, we are told, is easily worth $120,000.Despite full disclosure of the home\u0027s past, by the realtor, the couple proceeds with the purchase, and moves in. George appears not to be strong of faith, but Kathy is at least a nominal Catholic. The couple turns to Father Delaney to bless the home. Father Delaney (Rod Steiger) encounters troubles in trying to bless the home, including a room full of flies, out of season, violent stomach sickness, and later, blisters on his palm when trying to make even a phone contact with Kathy at the home.In his further efforts to confront the evil, he suffers a car wreck from brake and steering malfunction, a lack of support by his superiors in the diocese as he describes the occult things he\u0027s seen, and ultimately, blindness and a mental breakdown.It is most moving when he, at the altar of the church, is praying, \"Give them strength of mind and body, that they may do Your will,\" and a high-mounted statue begins to crumble and drop dust down in the chancel area. Refusing to run, he continues the prayer at a scream, \"Oh, Lord, give them strength of mind and body, that they may do Your will!\" weeping at the seeming triumph of evil over good. After this, we are shown Father Delaney, sitting in an outdoor garden area, in a totally unresponsive state. Presubably, his mind is gone. George begins to be more sullen and angry over perceived cold in the house, and obsesses with splitting logs and keeping the fireplace stoked. One of the two boys suffers a crushed hand when a sash window falls on it, and the little girl has an imaginary friend, Jody, who seems to be of a malevolent nature. Mom, Kathy, catches a glimpse of two red, swine-like eyes, outside the daughter\u0027s 2nd story window. The family dog, Harry, a black labrador, obsesses over a secret room in the basement.George\u0027s land surveying business begins to suffer with his lack of attendance, and his partner is concerned. The business partner\u0027s wife, very sensitive to the paranormal, is at once both revulsed and intrigued by the things she feels when at the house. \"Boy are these vibes ever strong!\" she says at one point.The Lutz\u0027s witness a black, bubbling substance coming up in the toilets, an \"ooze\" coming down from nail holes in the walls, a babysitter being trapped in a closet despite its not having a locking doorknob, the disappearance of $1,500.00 cash, and Kathy\u0027s Aunt, a nun, running from the house and vomiting. Kathy observes George\u0027s persistant waking at 3:15 am, feeling he must go check on the boathouse, and other unsettling incidents. Kathy has nightmares in which she is given details about the killings of the home\u0027s prior family.Their research at the library and at the county records office suggest that the house is built atop a tribal burial ground, and that a known devil worshiper named Ketcham had once lived on the land.Finally, the paranormal events drive the family to flee the house one night, in the pouring rain, no longer even worried about their posessions.

A man in Egyptian fez and garb follows a suited man to his apartment building. The landlady lets the Egyptian in when he asks for a Mr. Dragore. In Dragore\u0027s room the Egyptian, Mahmoud, threatens Dragore (who is also Egyptian) with a knife. He demands a jewel, the Eternal Light. He wants to return it to the tomb from which it was stolen. Dragore says it is too late, he has sold it to a Professor Morant. They join forces to get it back.The next scene is at Professor Morlant\u0027s estate home, Eastvale. Morlant is on his death bed. He seems disfigured. A parson, Nigel Hartley, rings at the door but is abruptly turned away as he is told the professor is a pagan. The doctor comes out of the professor\u0027s bedroom after examining the professor and says to someone that he hasn\u0027t long to live and goes down stairs and talks to Morlant\u0027s solicitor, Mr. Broughton. Broughton sends the doctor across the hall to get a drink. Broughton looks in the professor\u0027s books and sees he paid 75,000 pounds for the Eternal Light, which leaves him little.Morlant asks for his manservant, Laing. He tells Laing that he wants the jewel buried with him as it will enable him to receive eternal life at the next full moon. Laing is against the idea but agrees. Morlant binds his hand with the jewel in his grip. Morlant also tells Laing to watch Broughton as he doesn\u0027t trust him. Later, Morlant dies. He is buried in a large mausoleum on the estate grounds. Someone is watching from the bushes but we can\u0027t see who. Laing removes the jewel from the professors hand and locks the tomb with the key left inside. Inside the house, Laing hides the jewel in a coffee container. He then looks up the address of a Miss Betty Morlant in the city. Miss Morlant, it turns out, is one of the professor\u0027s two heirs.Broughton leaves but tells his chauffeur, Davis, to stay behind outside and tail Laing if he leaves. Broughton seems to think Laing is going to steal the jewel. Laing now heads for \"Yoxford Station\" with Davis following.Back in the city at Broughton\u0027s office, the other heir, and Miss Morlant\u0027s cousin, Ralph Morlant learns that his uncle is almost penniless except for his house. Ralph decides to meet Betty and then go to Eastvale against Broughton\u0027s wishes.That night, Laing meets Betty in the street and hands her a note which she reads and then puts in her purse. The note says \"There is something of value at Eastvale and others are after it. Come quickly.\" Almost immediately the purse is stolen by Broughton (it\u0027s dark and she doesn\u0027t see who the thief was) and the note torn up, but the Aga has been loitering outside also, sees all this, and reads the torn up note.Inside, Ralph and Betty and Betty\u0027s friend Laney, who is sort of silly, decide to leave immediately for Eastvale.Back at the tomb we see someone planting explosives at the base of the door, and running a blasting cap under the foundations into the tomb. Broughton arrives at the house and begins looking for the jewel. Broughton answers the door and lets in Betty, Ralph, Laney, and the parson who has also wandered by. Aga Ben Dragore and Mahmoud also arrive. Mahmoud hides on the grounds with a knife and the Aga enters the house. The Aga wants to enter the tomb but is refused. Laney is quite taken with the Aga. Betty and Ralph, when alone, reconcile. Laing returns.Professor Morlant rises from the dead, sees the jewel has been stolen and staggers out, like a zombie, and begins his search for the jewel. He encounters Mahmoud and kills him.The Aga and Laney go to the kitchen to make coffee. They are interrupted by Laing who retrieves the jewel and hides it in Miss Betty\u0027s over-night case. The Aga goes outside and Laney gets scared and joins him. The professor encounters Laing and learns that Betty has the jewel. He strangles Laing into unconsciousness.Betty goes upstairs to her room with her case. The professor follows her and takes the jewel after a struggle. Looking inside a window, the Aga sees that the professor now has the jewel. Broughton and Ralph are arguing downstairs when Betty comes in and says what has happened and faints.The professor returns to the tomb with the jewel and Laing trails behind with the cousins. The Aga rids himself of Laney. In the tomb, the professor uses a knife to draw the sign of Anubis on his chest. He then places the jewel into the hand of the statue of Anubis and waits for something to happen. The cousins enter the tomb, without Laing who has refused to go with them. Anubis closes his hand to accept the jewel and the professor collapses, dead. But then the \"parson\" comes out from behind the statue with the jewel. He had placed his own hand inside the arm of Anubis. The \"parson\" Nigel Hartley points a pistol at Ralph but Ralph throws an object at him and knocks him unconscious. However the Aga now enters, also with a pistol and wants the jewel. He and Ralph fight and Ralph hurts the Aga\u0027s arm, but eventually the Aga shoots Ralph with a glancing blow to the head which knocks him unconscious. The Aga leaves, locking everyone inside the tomb, which now catches fire from one of the torches.Earlier, Ralph had called the professor\u0027s doctor and asked him to send the police. As they are driving toward the estate the doctor tells the police that he thinks Professor Morlant wasn\u0027t actually dead, that he had just suffered from an attack of catalepsy.The Aga runs into Laney and they argue and he slaps her. As he does so, the jewel falls out of his pocket, unknown to him, and Laney picks it up.The Aga runs out to a car but Broughton is in it and pulls a pistol on him and demands the Eternal Light. The Aga surrenders but then discovers he doesn\u0027t have it and they both see Laney has it. They chase her. She holds the jewel over a well and says that if they shoot her she\u0027ll drop the jewel in the well. They are stopped at first but then decide it might be okay if the jewel goes into the well as they can retrieve it. Just as they start to shoot her, the police arrive and disarm Broughton and Laney hands them the jewel.Back inside the tomb, just when everyone seems about to die, The fake parson, Nigel Hartley, comes to and detonates the explosives, which he had buried earlier which blows the door open.Ralph and Betty come staggering out of the tomb and kiss each other.The end.","numvotes":"2754","primarytitle":"The Ghoul"},"color":"rgb(82,77,74)","size":1.0},{"source":"form","target":"tt2837694","id":"6867","attributes":{"countriesoforigin":"Japan","averagerating":"6.4","titletype":"movie","notes":"Very strange cut-paper short","originaltitle":"Moeru butsuzô ningen","storyline":"There is a series of Buddha statue thefts in Kyoto.

Kathy is tricked into going on a date with Mr. Vernon, but when she overeagerly makes her move onto him in his parked car in the woods, the students appear in their cars to taunt her. Running away from several carloads of her tormentors, Kathy runs onto a busy street where she immediately gets hit by an oncoming car and is admitted to the local hospital in a coma.

The first victim is Mr. Vernon, whom asks Eva on a date. That night while waiting for Eva to show up at the gym for their secret rendezvous, the narcissist Mr. Vernon is attacked and strangled by his own reflection when it jumps out of a mirror.

Four hundred years later, one night in 1937, part of a wall in a building collapsed. Amongst the victims was a man of strange skin, the color of marble in moonlight, his chest mortally pierced. His last words: Sua tempore. This was the alchemist. The authorities located the residence of the dead man. What they found there was never fully revealed to the public. After a brief investigation, the mansion and its contents were sold at public auction. Never on any list or inventory was the Cronos device mentioned. As far as anyone knew, it never existed.\"What was not revealed to the public was that a human male was found hanging from his feet, his blood draining into a basin. Also unknown to the public, except for a dying millionaire named de la Guardia [Claudio Brook] who will stop at nothing to obtain it, the Cronos device had been hidden in the base of a statue of an archangel. De la Guardia had spent his life acquiring old statues of archangels, always in search of the hidden Cronos device... so far in vain... until the day that the archangel shows up in the antique shop of Jesus Gris [Frederico Luppi]. Jesus and his granddaughter find the device and, not knowing what it is, Jesus activates it. He is horrified as claws protrude from the orb, hold fast to his hand and proceed to dig into   his flesh.Meanwhile, de la Guardia (who lives in an antiseptic chamber) sends his nephew Angel [Ron Perlman] to buy the archangel.

Fortunately, Jesus has come to realize that the Cronos device confers immortality, and he uses it. But there is a cost. He begins to crave human blood, and his flesh starts peeling off, exposing a strange layer of skin, the color of marble in moonlight. In the final confrontation between Jesus, de la Guardia, and Angel, Jesus emerges victorious. Still, he smashes the Cronos device and goes home to Aurora and his girlfriend... to die. [Original synopsis by bj_kuehl]___   A voice over (Jorge Martínez de Hoyos) tells the story of Humberto Oganelli (Mario Iván Martínez), an Alchimist who arrived to Veracruz in Mexico running away from the Inquisition. In 1937, a building collapsed, and a grey-skinned men was discovered. It was Oganellli, the inventor of the Cronos device. He is supposed to die at that moment, impalled onto an iron stick. Every together renmant of that building was auctioned, including the small statue of an angel.Years later, the angel appears at the antiquarian\u0027s shop. Somebody (Luis Rodríguez) enters to look at it but leaves without buying it. Jesús Gris (Federico Luppi) has bought it. He realises that the angel is hollow, because, through one of the eyes\u0027 empty plaster socket, several huge bus fall down to the floor. Jesús picks up a kind of oval machinery thingy; it\u0027s the Cronos watch, a golden watch in the shape of a metal scarab. His mute granddaughter, Aurora (Tamara Shanath) is with him when he finds it.Ángel de la Guardia (Ron Perlman) is told where the angel statue is. In his turn, he tells his uncle, a millionaire De la Guardia (Claudio Brook) the news. De la Guardia wants the angel statue at all costs. Ángel buys it for him.Jesús wants to keep the watch. He sets the machiney onto motion. At first, it looks safe, but then 6 cocroach-like legs protude from the watch and make a hole on his hand. He doesn\u0027t let Aurora to get near the thing. His girlfriend Mercedes (Margarita Isabel), a tango-dance teacher, tends to his wound. She takes out a kind of metal sting from his hand and gives him some stiches.At night, Jesús doesn\u0027t feel very well. He goes to drink some water to the fridge, but the thing which attracts him the most is the bright red meat. Jesús feels restless. He sets the watch in motion again. A fourth sting comes out of the back side of the watch. That morning, the sun is shining outside. Jesús draws the curtains. His face looks much longer, but he shaves and he tells his girlfriend that he looks much younger because he has saved his white-haired moustache.When Jesús arrives to the shop, it has been vandalised. He contronts Ángel. He is frustrated because the archangel statue was hollow... and empty. De la Guardia tells him about the history of the Cronos mechanism. He also admits that he\u0027s dying of his sickness, and no treatment has worked so far. Jesús doesn\u0027t want to lose the Cronos. Jesús leaves on a hurry by the rooftop trying to look for Aurora, as he suddenly realises she\u0027s in danger. Aurora has picked up the Cronos to play with it. When he finds Aurora, he realises that she is frightened and tries to hide from him, or maybe she\u0027s scared about him, in any case she stops playing with her toy teaset and hides away from him. He tries to calm her down. She has hidden the Cronos inside her teddy bear. Immediately, Jesús uses the Cronos again, this time on his chest.Jesús is still guessing at the nature of the Cronos, but he feels that it\u0027s doing him good. His chest wound now expels a kind of mucose, and his eyes feel weird. Mercedes insists on his leaving the bathroom and go with her to the New Year\u0027s Eve party. Mercedes wonders how anyone can change so fast in such a short period of time. They dance in love there at the party. Aurora goes with them, but the girl usually stays on her own, silent as always. During the party, a man (Javier Álvarez) gets hurt and starts bleeding profusely. Jesús can\u0027t refrain from following that man to the gent\u0027s. They make small talk, but Jesús can\u0027t stop himself from staring at the spilled blood. He gets down on the floor to lick a blood stain. Somebody kicks him while he\u0027s doing that, knocking him out. The countdown to the first day of the year is being celebrated by everybody else. Meanwhile, Jesús is pushed out of the place where the party takes place.When he wakes up, he\u0027s in a car with Ángel, who beats him up. Ángel won\u0027t stop seeking the Cronos. Jesús asks what they want it for. Ángel leaves Jesús unconscious. Ángel pushes the car down from a cliff with Jesús inside.A funeral technician called Tito (Daniel Giménez Cacho) is preparing Jesús\u0027 corpse for burial. He is told that he\u0027ll be cremated, so all his excellent artistic work will be useless. De la Guardia tells off his nephew because he couldn\u0027t get the scarab and probably Jesús is still alive. Ángel goes to the funeral home and tries to wake Jesús up by closing his nostrils. Ángel leaves him for dead. Tito prepares the crematorium to burn the coffin - but there are problems with the gas and the piping, as all the tubes and pipes are really old and they would need maintenance. The technician leaves the room for some seconds to solve the problem. He doesn\u0027t realise that the coffee is empty, he just closes it down again without thinking about it. Ángel appears with the funeral house director (Juan Carlos Colombo) to enquire about the body of Jesús. The technician shows him the empty coffin burning to ashes in the oven. Ángel smiles.It\u0027s freezing. It\u0027s night. Jesús walks dazed confused and with a grey wounded face. He stops by a rubbish bin and he sees printed his own orbituary. Jesús tries to phone Mercedes. When he finally speaks up, Mercedes hangs up. Jesús limps home. It\u0027s Christmas and decorations are on the streets and the main hall of his building. He is opened the door by Aurora, who offers a towel for him. Jesús uses the Cronos mechanism again.Daylight really hurts him, so he hides inside an old trunk. Aurora paints the trunk and keeps on playing. Jesús writes a long letter to Mercedes. Jesús\u0027 faces is worst still. Jesús comes back to De la Guardia\u0027s warehouse, and he realises that Aurora has followed him. He tries to scare her away. She finds the little book written by Humberto Oganelli. There are some pages missing, and De la Guardia says that he\u0027s eaten them. De la Guardia takes off some pieces of dangling skin from Jesús\u0027 face nows feels metalic. De la Guardia rings the bell for his son. Ángel is pissed off at being disturbed by his uncle. De la Guardia tells Jesús that he needs to artifact to keep himself alive, and that he also needs blood. Jesús shows the Cronos to him and asks for the exit. De la Guardia knighs him. He fights with Jesús, but Aurora hits De la Guardia with a long stick. Jesús wakes up. Ángel appears and he tries to talk to his uncle. Jesús drinks the blood from De la Guardia\u0027s body. Ángel gets off from the lift and finds his uncle dead. Jesús and Aurora have hidden away. Ángel laughs with joy as everything will become his. However, at that moment, De la Guardia asks him for help, but his nephew kills him, fed up of being kept waiting. Jesús and Aurora hit Ángel. They run across the rooftops. He tells her granddaughter to leave by doing down the façade\u0027s ladder. Ángel hits Jesús. His victim looks week and unable to defend himself: he can only crawl away from him. To end the matter, Jesús throws himself agains Ángel\u0027s body, making him fall to the floor. Aurora sets the mechanism onto motion. Inside the scarab, a huge bag gives Jesús life. Aurora caresses Jesús\u0027 deformed face. Jesús peels off his own skin. Aurora was a bit hurt, so she\u0027s broken her lip. She offers her blood to Jesús, who finally decides to reject it with a supreme effort. Jesús shouts \"NO!\", and he removes the Cronos from his chest. He uses a stone to break it into pieces.

The astronomer is very much excited, and, rushing over to the large telescope he tries to discover by what means she had vanished. The moon now appears, and begins her repast by eating the immense telescope used by the astronomer. The astronomer flies around apparently wild at the loss of his wonderful telescope. Suddenly the moon opens wide her mouth and there comes forth a tot of about five summers. She is immediately followed by two others, and they proceed to dance around the astronomer, and vanish one at a time until but one is left. The astronomer, picking her up, thinking he could keep her, hugs her tightly in his arms, but she also vanishes. Tired and heart-broken the astronomer grasps a broom and attempts to strike the moon, when she suddenly vanishes and in the distance laughs at him, rolling his eyes forward and backward, apparently convulsed with laughter. The moon suddenly changes to a crescent, and a fairy appears sitting on it. The veiled figure which stands before him throws back its veil and becomes animated; he rushes forward and grasps it, when, to his utter amazement, it disappears in the air. The Fairy Queen appears in the crescent.

He is a Professor of English at the University of Southern California. He explains that there are just a few areas left on Earth that are unknown and briefly describes a few theories that postulate there may be places deep under the surface of the Earth where man can survive.In Asia an archeological dig has discovered something. Dr. Roger Bentley (John Agar) and Prof. Etienne Lafarge (Nestor Paiva) expose a stone tablet. They take it back to their tent to clean and examine it. We are introduced to Dr. Jud Bellamin (Hugh Beaumont) and Dr. Paul Stuart (Phil Chambers) who ask Bentley to translate the find: it may be related to the story of Gilgamesh and Ishtar. An earthquake rattles the area and the tablet is broken. This puts their work a month behind schedule. A small boy discovers something the earthquake brought down a mountain and brings it to Bentley. He cleans it and it is revealed to be an ancient oil lamp. The inscription is translated as a pre-biblical Noah\u0027s Ark story. The party of scientists set off for the mountain where the artifact originated before it was dislodged by the earthquake.They set up base camp and plan their final assault on the mountain the next day. A storm hits the base camp that evening. As they set off the next morning an avalanche brings down an arm from a statue. They continue climbing and discover the ruins of an ancient Sumarian civilization on a small plateau. They estimate the ruins are 5,000 years old. While Dr. Stuart walks around the ruins he falls down through an opening. The rest of the party goes down on ropes to save him. Bentley leads the way, followed by Lafarge, who is much older than the rest. Bellamin is third down the opening followed by Nazar (Rodd Redwing). After dropping down about 200 feet Bentley finds Stuart, but he died in the fall. Nazar notices a loose piton and hammers it secure, but that triggers a rockfall and he is killed and the three archeologists are trapped.They start searching for a way out, but Lafarge is experiencing breathing problems. He is also claustrophobic, They wander through the cave and discover a light source, which reveals a large underground city. They notice a very large tablet that informs them they have discovered the temple of Ishtar. They bed down for the night, but a lizard creature (a mole person?) digs up to the surface to spy on the three. A short time later, the party is attacked, sacks are placed over their heads, and they are pulled underground. They awake in a cave and Lafarge has claw marks on his chest. Two very pale white representative of the human underground civilization suddenly appear and direct they follow them. The scientists are escorted back to the city and presented to the High Priest, Ilinu (Alan Napier) who is performing a ritual. Ilinu immediately suspects the strangers and tells the king that they are evil. The king questions the three archeologists. At the conclusion of the questioning the high priest sentences them to death.The three escape into a cave, with guards in hot pursuit. Bentley shines his flashlight in the face of the First Officer (Robin Hughes) who cringes and retreats. It seems the light hurts their eyes. The three return to the city and shine their flashlight on the King and High Priest and they also retreat. The inhabitants of the city are albino, adapted to a world without sunlight. A lizard creature pulls the body of one of the guards underground. Seeing this, Lafarge panics and runs back into one of the caves. Bentley and Bellamin follow and discover a slave labor camp where the lizard creatures are forced to cultivate the food source--mushrooms. The guards whip their charges, which particularly incenses Bentley. Laforge is attacked and killed by a lizard creature, but is driven off by the flashlight before he can eat Laforge.Bentley and Bellamin return to the city and are met by the high priest along the way who tells them that they are welcome back to the city since they \"possess the divine fire of Ishtar\". The King is convinced they are holy messengers and are invited to a feast. One of the servers, Adad (Cynthia Patrick) drops her bowl of mushrooms, and is ordered whipped by the king. Bentley stops the punishment and is told not to interfere by the High Priest. Bentley helps her to her feet and notices she is not albino, but normally pigmented. The King presents Adad as a gift to Bentley. The High Priest explains that she is not human (like them) but a \"marked one\". The King and Priest further explain that when the population gets too large the excess are sacrificed in the fire of Ishtar.Bentley and Adad talk about their respective worlds as the High Priest spies on them. The next day Bentley and Bellamin tour the city. Meanwhile the High Priest meets with his fellow priests and plots to get the flashlight. This will show the king that the strangers are not divine, but mere mortals.Bentley and Bellamin intercede when three lizard creatures are being beaten, but their flashlight batteries begin to fail. They free the lizard creatures. Food production has been reduced because the lizard creatures are rebelling against their mistreatment. The High Priest schedules another sacrifice.

Inside the box they discover artifacts belonging to Mater Lachrymarum (Moran Atias), the last surviving member of the Three Mothers; an ancient trio of powerful black witches. In particular, the box contains a magic cloak that, when worn by Mater Lachrymarum, increases her powers significantly.The urn is shipped to the Museum of Ancient Art in Rome, where Sarah Mandy (Asia Argento), an Italian-American studying art restoration works. Sarah is dating the curator Michael Pierce (Adam James), a single father who is away from the museum that night. With help from the assistant curator Giselle (Coralina Cataldi-Tassoni), Sarah opens the box and finds the cloak, a dagger, and three statues representing the three witches. Sending Sarah to her office to retrieve tools to help her translate the text on the artifacts, Giselle is promptly attacked by the demonic agents of Mater Lachrymarum. Sarah arrives too late to save Giselle (who is being disembowelled by the monsters) and starts to flee the museum. Unfortunately, she is pursued by Mater Lachrymarum\u0027s familiar (a baboon) and is only able to escape when a disembodied voice magically throws open a series of locked doors keeping her trapped inside the museum. Sarah tells the police what happened as she spends the night with Michael and his son. Michael visits the Cardinal who sent him the urn only to find out that, shortly after mailing the urn to him, he had a severe stroke and is now in a coma. An assistant of the priest gives Michael a piece of paper, which the Cardinal was writing on before collapsing. On it is scrawled the name \"Mater Lachrymarum\". As he leaves the hospital, a pair of witches observe Michael leaving the building.Back in Rome, chaos descends as a wave of mass suicides, murder, and violence engulfs the city. Sarah continues her own research only to be summoned by Michael to his apartment. The witches have kidnapped his young son and won\u0027t return the boy to him unless he stops his investigation. Sarah begs him to call the police (who are tailing Sarah, ever since the murder at the museum) but Michael refuses to and instead opts to visit a local priest (Udo Kier) who is a trained exorcist. This goes badly for Michael; the two witches see him and he is soon captured and murdered, along with his son, whose body is cannibalized by the rapidly-expanding coven. However, before he is killed, Michael calls Sarah and begs for her to come and help him.As Sarah makes her way through a crowded train station, Sarah is spotted by a gang of witches who, like so many other witches, have arrived in Rome from all over the world in order to pledge their loyalty to Mater Lachrymarum. Pursued by the witches and the police, the disembodied voice from before instructs Sarah on how to magically make herself invisible. She uses this to avoid the police detective, though she is forced to kill a Japanese witch (Jun Ichikawa) who catches and corners her on the train.At the priest\u0027s home, Sarah meets Marta (Valeria Cavalli), a fellow white witch and friend of Sarah\u0027s deceased mother Elisa (Daria Nicolodi). Realizing that Sarah\u0027s mother is the voice guiding her, Marta reveals details to Sarah about her parents. Her mother was a powerful white witch who dared to challenge and severely wound Mater Suspiriorum, the eldest and wisest of the Three Mothers (a reference to \u0027Suspria\u0027). In response to this, Suspiriorum (known by her alias as Elena Markos) caused the fatal car crash that killed Sarah\u0027s parents. Though Mater Suspiriorum and her sister Mater Tenebrarum are now dead, their sibling Mater Lachrymarum has emerged from the shadows to bring about the second age of magic, with the fall of Rome as her coming out party. They talk to the priest, only for him to be killed before he can give the two a copy of a book that would explain Mater Lachrymarum\u0027s backstory to them by a patient of his.Escaping back to the city, Sarah goes to her own home but finds Mater Lachrymarum\u0027s goons waiting for her. She heads to Marta\u0027s house, but once again Mater Lachrymarum\u0027s minions strike and Marta and her lesbian lover are murdered. Fleeing, Sarah spots Michael, who takes her back to his apartment. Unfortunately, Sarah soon realizes that Michael is dead and that Mater Lachrymarum is animating his body in an attempt to kill her. As she burns her lover\u0027s still-animate body, the ghost of her mother intervenes one final time to grab Michael and banish him (and possibly herself) to Hell.Out of options, Sarah locates a powerful alchemist, who Marta mentioned as her only hope to learn how to fight Mater Lachrymarum. After being briefly paralyzed by the alchemist (so that he could perform a test on her to see if she was a white witch or an evil witch), the alchemist gives Sarah the only help he has in locating Mater Lachrymarum\u0027s dwelling. Sarah is given a copy of \"The Three Mothers\" to read (a reference to the previous movie \u0027Inferno\u0027), and from this (and from following a group of witches) Sarah finds Mater Lachrymarum\u0027s lair; a now run-down and disrepaired mansion.At this point, Sarah is joined by one of the police detectives hunting (whom think she has something to do with the recent murders in Rome) her and the two go into the catacombs under the house to find Mater Lachrymarum. However, the two become separated, and the detective is tortured alongside the alchemist and his assistant, who dies after his arm is chopped off by one of Mater Lachrymarum\u0027s minions. Sarah is caught and brought before Mater Lachrymarum, who offers Sarah up to her cannibal followers but makes the mistake of removing her cloak. Sarah, having healed the detective\u0027s wounds, grabs the cloak and tosses it into a nearby fire. This causes the mansion to collapse as a pillar falls and impales Mater Lachrymarum. With the Mother\u0027s followers crushed as the caves collapses, Sarah and the detective manage to escape from the catacombs and as they reach the surface, the both laugh in horror and shock, as they realize that the threat of the Three Mothers has been defeated once and for all.","numvotes":"10094","primarytitle":"Mother of Tears","productioncompany":"Medusa Film","countriesoforigin":"Italy, United States","averagerating":"5.0","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"La terza madre","storyline":"An ancient urn is found in a cemetery outside Rome.

As part of the ritual they chop her hand off, take it outside and throw it to the jackals. They go back into tomb and place the lid on the sarcophagus. Outside, a jackal dies on the ground with its throat ripped and bloody as the hand crawls away. As the priests leave the tomb a sandstorm appears and they all die with lacerated throats too. The severed hand crawls away. Margaret awakes from her nightmare. Her father Professor Julian Fuchs (Andrew Weir) comes into bedroom to comfort her. Another man, Corbeck (James Villiers), watches then from the window of an empty house opposite.Next morning the Professor gives Margaret a ring containing a large ruby. She puts it on showing she has a scar completely across her wrist before going off with her boyfriend Tod (Mark Edwards) in his sports car, observed again from by Corbeck from opposite.In a mental hospital two orderlies look at Berrigan (George Coulouris) in his cell which has a desk and some furnishings. He is seeing some lights that look like stars on his carpet.Tod inspects Margaret\u0027s ring closely. He thinks it must have come from her father\u0027s expedition. Tod says he will take it to a friend who can give them more information.At the mental hospital, Corbeck visits Berrigan. He tries to take an ornamental cobra from the wardrobe but Berrigan attacks him and the orderlies intervene and make him leave.Tod and Margaret visit expert Geoffrey Dandridge (Hugh Burden) to show him the ring but when he sees Margaret he collapses. Star-like lights appear in the ring.Fortune teller Helen Dickerson (Rosalie Crutchley) is looking into her crystal ball to read a fortune for her customer but sees the same star-like lights too. She is alarmed and asks the customer to leave.Later, at the end of the day, Geoffrey sends his assistant home then goes to a cupboard and takes out and opens a box containing a jackal\u0027s skull. Corbeck arrives and Geoffrey explains that he has seen a woman with the ring. Corbeck explains to Geoffrey she is Margaret Fuchs, daughter of Professor Fuchs, and it will soon be her birthday and soon be time.That night Margaret dreams again about the soul of Queen Tera living all these years while her mortal body has waited. Her time is drawing near and it was she who guided people to her tomb to find her. In a flashback, explorers Professor Fuchs, Geoffrey, Corbeck, Berrigan and Helen Dickerson enter Queen Tera\u0027s tomb. Around the tomb are several ornaments around including one of a cobra snake, the skull of jackal, and a cat. They open the sarcophagus and see Queen Tera\u0027s body with the hand severed. The hand is on the floor next to the sarcophagus with the red ruby ring on a finger. The Professor takes the ring off and from its inscriptions identifies the queen as Tera. At the exact same time, Mrs Fuchs is in hospital giving birth to baby but she dies in the process. The baby at first appears to be stillborn but then doctors hear its heart start beating. The severed arm of Queen Tera in the sarcophagus starts bleeding fresh blood. Margaret wakes up from her dream and tells Tod she must leave immediately.In the basement of his house Professor Fuchs opens the sarcophagus and looks at Queen Tera\u0027s body. Margaret and Tod arrive, observed by Corbeck opposite, but there is an ominous feeling and sound from the basement. They break down the door to the basement and rush to the Professor who has cuts on his neck. He instructs them to call Doctor Putnum (Aubrey Morris). They put the Professor in bed but he is unresponsive. Doctor Putnum says the Professor will be like that for a few days and cannot reveal much about Professor\u0027s wishes other than his work would astound the world of science.That night Margaret goes to the basement and looks at Queen Tera\u0027s body. Corbeck arrives and explains the ruby is the symbol of the god to come. The Professor life\u0027s work was to discover the legend of the queen and find the truth, and he and Corbeck and their team searched for her tomb together. There was an attack on one of their members in tomb and fresh blood from Tera\u0027s wrist at exactly the same time Margaret was born in the image of Tera. Tod arrives and they agree Tera has some kind of astral power which will be directed against them if they don\u0027t understand it. They agree they must contact all old members of team to help reunite Tera with her soul.Tod and Margaret visit Berrigan at the mental hospital. When he sees Margaret he is frightened. Margaret realises he thinks she is Tera so she pretends to be Tera and asks for her familiar - her snake. He says he has not got it, then breaks down causing the orderlies to enter and restrain him and Tod and Margaret have to leave.Back home, Putnum is checking on the Professor. He is still unconscious and the doctor says there will be some paralysis on one side. He says the Professor wanted to protect her from the artefacts in the basement.Tod reads the Professor\u0027s journal. The simultaneous events of the Professor entering the tomb and Margaret\u0027s birth were a unity created by Tera. Tera had prepared for an abstract metaphysical state by lying in her sarcophagus, creating an astral body with freewill and a conscious intelligence. He believes this power could be used to keep people alive for a long time in suspended animation. Margaret says she feels Tera is dreaming of loneliness, of ancient land and times, when love was a divine possession.In the mental hospital that night the orderlies tease Berrigan with the cobra then leave it on the desk where he can see it when they leave. He struggles in his strait-jacket then goes still and listens. Suddenly the snake disappears from the desk and he sees its shadow approaching him. The window bursts open and wind blows everything around but he cannot escape. The snake approaches and strikes him. He dies with his cuts to his throat.The next morning the Professor wakes up. Margaret explains he had a terrible shock. She asks about the ring and why would it protect her. The Professor explains the priest severed it because they thought it was source of her evil. She says Berrigan is dead and the snake has appeared in their basement. She mentions Corbeck but the Professor implores her not to have anything to do with him. She asks where Tera\u0027s hand is but he cannot answer. Out of the window she sees Corbeck going into house opposite and she goes across to confront him. They argue over the facts but she says they need her and she is interested in the power that she may now have. Corbeck says Tera is beyond good and evil and they need to understand her. He says the relics from her tomb are needed for her resurrection from the dead, to provide power over life and death. He says her father is weak and cannot be a part of it. She says she will do anything to have the power so Corbeck says they will do it together.At Geoffrey\u0027s, his assistant tells him about Berrigan\u0027s death as she leaves at the end of the day. He realises that the jackal skull is significant and takes it out. Margaret arrives and says she wants the skull. He panics and tries to escape out of the window and down the fire escape but he drops the box. As he looks for it he hears a jackal call. He flees in fright.Tod arrives wondering what is going on. Margaret will not tell him anything and leaves. He looks around and hears the jackal call from outside. He investigates, going down the fire escape where he finds the empty box that housed the skull. Hearing noises then a scream he finds Geoffrey\u0027s body with the throat lacerated and bloody. He sees the shadow of a jackal running away.Margaret looks at Tera\u0027s body in the sarcophagus. The wrist is still bleeding fresh blood. Corbeck arrives and together they see that both the cobra and the jackal\u0027s skull are now present in the basement. Tod arrives and tries to stop Corbeck and Margaret. When they refuse he drives away to get help. Margaret screams wishing Tod dead. Tod crashes his car into a tree, his throat lacerated and covered in blood. She is frightened but Corbeck says she must not weaken and she is coming of age. Margaret collapses to the floor.The Professor staggers down to the basement and sees Margaret lying on the floor. Corbeck explains that Margaret no longer exists and soon Tera will be reborn and the Professor cannot do anything to stop it. Corbeck leaves to get the final artefact, the third and final phase of Tera\u0027s soul.Margaret dreams in bed watched by the Professor and Doctor Putnam. The Professor insists Putnum give her an injection to ensure she will not wake but while he is preparing it she wakes up. He tries to convince her to go back to bed but she uses her willpower to kill him. He dies with a lacerated throat like the others and Margaret flees. The Professor returns to find Putnum\u0027s body, then Corbeck arrives and helps the Professor move the body downstairs. Corbeck says they need each other and they control Tera not the other way around. Corbeck knows where Margaret has gone.Margaret arrives at Helen Dickerson\u0027s house. She is afraid and tries to strike Margaret but cannot do so. Instead she concedes and gives Margaret the statue of the cat. As Margaret leaves, she uses her willpower again to kill Helen. Corbeck arrives and sees Helen\u0027s body. Margaret reappears at the door and tells Corbeck to come.The Professor finds the scroll of life in the basement then sees that the statue of the cat has appeared. He looks at the severed hand in its box, then Margaret and Corbeck arrive. Corbeck takes the severed hand and places it back in the sarcophagus next to the wrist. The Professor implores him not to read the scroll saying Tera has abused her power and to wait, but Margaret says she is ready and where there is good there must be the opposite. Corbeck reads the scroll of life, to reunite Tera\u0027s soul and body and rekindle her astral spirit. The hand reattaches itself to the wrist. Margaret says to the Professor it was Tera that lead them to the tomb. The Professor realises Tera is in Margaret and Corbeck must not finish scroll. They stab Corbeck to death with some relics but Tera awakes. They try to kill her too but she kills the Professor first. Margaret manages to stab her but the building collapses in on top of them all.In a hospital, the medical staff have no idea who the woman all bandaged in the bed is.

As a means of coping with these recurring nightmares and at the request of his girlfriend Lori (Anne Bobby), Boone is seeing psychotherapist Dr. Phillip K. Decker (David Cronenberg), who convinces Boone that he has committed a series of gruesome murders. In reality, Decker is a serial killer who dons a grotesque mask and has been murdering several families, all whom he sees as disgusting \"breeders\". Decker attempts to pin the blame for his killing spree on Boone. He gives Boone a bottle of lithium (actually a hallucinogenic substance) and twenty four hours to turn himself in. Boone wanders the streets in a hallucinogenic haze. He is hit by a truck and taken to a hospital.In the hospital, Boone overhears the drug-addled cries of Narcisse (Hugh Ross), who is waiting for the monsters to take him to Midian. Narcisse, led to believe Boone is a messenger from Midian sent to test him, tells Boone the way, before tearing the skin from his face with a pair of razors, in order to show his \"true face\". Boone escapes the hospital and makes his way to Midian, an entire city standing under a massive graveyard. Boone encounters two supernatural creatures named Kinski (Nicholas Vince) and Peloquin (Oliver Parker) who inhabit the city. Kinski says they should take him below but Peloquin states that whereas they are \"Nightbreed\", Boone is a \"natural\" and thinks he should die. Boone pleads with them, claiming he is a murderer and hence belongs with the monsters, but Peloquin says he can smell innocence. Peloquin transforms himself into a more monstrous state and bites Boone on the shoulder intending to devour him, but Boone manages to escape and leaves the graveyard, only to run into an entire squad of police officers waiting outside the gate with Decker. Decker tries to get Boone to surrender and suddenly yells that Boone has a gun. Boone is then gunned down by the police. At the morgue, Boone comes back to life due to Peloquin\u0027s bite becoming a Nightbreed. He makes his way back to Midian where Narcisse has also returned to. Boone is schooled in the laws of Midian and is inducted into Midian\u0027s society by Dirk Lylesburg (Doug Bradley), the leader of the Nightbreed. Lylesburg dips his hand into blood of Baphomet (the deity of Midian) and presses it to Boone\u0027s chest, completing his induction ceremony.Lori, seeking to understand why Boone left her, resolves to investigate Midian for herself. She befriends a woman named Sheryl Anne (Debora Weston) and drives out to the cemetery. She wanders into the cemetery, leaving Sheryl Anne waiting at the car. She finds a dying creature out in the sunlight and at the pleading request of a Nightbreed woman named Rachel (Catherine Chevalier), picks it up and takes it into the shadows, where it transforms into a little girl who happens to be Rachel\u0027s daughter Babette, who is sensitive to sunlight. Lori asks after Boone, only to be rebuffed by Lylesburg, who assures her that Boone is now Nightbreed, and hence no longer part of her world. Lori tries to make her way into Midian but is scared off by Peloquin. As she leaves the cemetery, she is greeted by the sight of Sheryl Anne\u0027s dead body and her new boyfriend, who reveals himself as Decker. He tries to kill Lori in an attempt to bring Boone out of hiding. Decker chases Lori back into the cemetery where he knocks Lori unconscious. Before he can kill her however, Boone appears. Decker stabs him only to learn that Boone cannot be killed due to his supernatural transformation. Decker manages to escape and Boone takes Lori into Midian, where she regains consciousness deep inside the city. Lori is told of the history of Midian by Rachel: the monsters of lore were peaceful beings, hunted to near extinction by frightened and superstitious humans. Boone and Lori are then banished from Midian by Lylesburg. Meanwhile, Decker interrogates a local mechanic who once wanted to join the Nightbreed and learns how they can die. He then murders the residents of the hotel where Boone and Lori are staying. Boone finds the murder scene. Unable to control his thirst for blood, Boone takes a taste. The police find him and take him into custody. At Decker\u0027s urging, the local police and militia led by a bloodthirsty police captain named Eigerman (Charles Haid) form up a small army to attack Midian. They release a drunken priest named Ashberry (Malcolm Smith) to serve them as God\u0027s servant in the battle. Lori, Rachel, and Narcisse race to the jail to release Boone. Lori shows Boone that she loves him even as a \"monster\". The four head back to Midian where Boone convinces the scared Nightbreed to fight back.During the battle, Ashberry is horrified to learn that there are women and children among the Nightbreed and tries to stop the attack, but is roughly beaten down by Eigerman. Ashberry then finds the statue of Baphomet. He drops his cross and Bible and moves forward to swear allegiance, but is splashed and severely burned by the blood of Baphomet and transformed. The Nightbreed manages to fight back, but Boone learns from Lylesburg that Baphomet is going to destroy all of Midian. He tells Lylesburg to release the Berserkers, a monstrous, feral breed that were imprisoned due to their sheer insanity. Lylesburg attempts to open the cages but is killed, leaving Boone to release them. The Beserkers attack the humans furiously, turning the tide of the battle as the humans flee in fear. Boone and Decker then face each other in the burning wreckage of Midian. The two fight and Boone kills him. Boone then goes to Baphomet (Bernard Henry), who says that he has caused the end of Midian, but also that this was foretold. Baphomet charges Boone with finding a new home for the Nightbreed and renames him \"Cabal.\" Boone makes his way out of Midian with Lori. The remaining Nightbreed meet in an old barn. Boone says his goodbyes to Narcisse promising that he will not forget the Nightbreed and that he will find a place where they will all be safe.Meanwhile in the ruins of Midian, Ashberry stands in front of Decker\u0027s corpse and states that he wants to exact vengeance on Baphomet and the Breed. He takes some of the blood of Baphomet and pushes it into Decker\u0027s chest wound. Decker suddenly springs back to life with a scream as Ashberry chants \"Hallelujah\" over and over again.Alternate endingIn an alternate ending (as used by The Cabal Cut of the movie), the Nightbreed await Boone in a barn whilst Boone says his goodbyes to Lori as he must venture the world to find a new home for them, but he promises to return to her. Lori, fearing she will be elderly when the time comes whilst Boone will retain his youth, stabs herself and dies. Boone is forced into resurrecting her into another Nightbreed. At first the revival doesn\u0027t seem to work, but it is eventually successful.Elsewhere, Captain Eigerman wanders the underground remains where he stumbles upon the transformed Ashberry who desires revenge. Eigerman shares this desire, but Ashberry rejects him and kills Eigerman and begins his hunt for the Nightbreed.","numvotes":"22535","primarytitle":"Nightbreed"},"color":"rgb(82,77,74)","size":1.0},{"source":"object of desire","target":"tt6287420","id":"6593","attributes":{"productioncompany":"Exploitation International Pictures","countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"5.4","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"Dream Nightmare","storyline":"A Manny Velazquez Psychological Thriller about a young detective (played by Alen Rios) finds a handcrafted Indian sculpture in an alley, and takes it home with him, but he soon realizes that the sculpture is bringing his worst fears to life. —Dreamier (2016)","startyear":"2016","runtimeminutes":"75","numvotes":"26","primarytitle":"Dream Nightmare"},"color":"rgb(76,80,97)","size":2.0},{"source":"object of desire","target":"tt0071768","id":"6719","attributes":{"productioncompany":"Eguiluz Films","countriesoforigin":"Spain, Liechtenstein","averagerating":"4.8","titletype":"movie","notes":"Disability motif","originaltitle":"La loba y la Paloma","storyline":"Four villains seek to wrest from a mute girl the secret location of a prehistoric gold statuette discovered by her father.

Another man then kills him by smashing his head with a sledgehammer.A journalist, Carmen (Cindy Sampson), is having problems with her relationship with her boyfriend, Marcus (Aaron Ashmore) who is a photographer. Marcus says that although both of them are busy with their respective work, Carmen never seems to stop thinking about it and tends to ignore him.Carmen asks her boss to allow her to to investigate the disappearances of several tourists in the fictional Polish village of Alvania (the letter v is not part of the modern Polish alphabet). The last person to go missing was Eric Taylor (Ben Lewis), the man killed at the beginning of the film. She also mentions that the luggages of all the missing tourists end up being found all around Eastern Europe. Her boss isn\u0027t interested in another missing persons case, saying that people go missing all the time and does not give her permission to go. Instead, he would rather have her investigate why a farmer\u0027s bees go missing.Carmen and her intern Sara (Meghan Heffern) visit Eric\u0027s mother, Laura. Laura tells them that she has tried to get the help of both the Polish and the American Police. However, they are unwilling to help her. Carmen asks Laura if Eric\u0027s luggage has been returned to her. Laura says that it has and Carmen borrows Eric\u0027s journal.Later in her home while reading Eric\u0027s journal, she sees a vision of Eric who has bloody eyes and tells her \"leave me alone\". But this is revealed to be just a dream. Carmen, wanting to mend her relationship with Marcus as well as her job, urges him to come with her and Sara to Alvania. Upon reaching Alvania, they find the village people to be secretive, unfriendly and unwelcoming, just as described in the last entry in Eric\u0027s journal. Although English is taught in the villages\u0027 school, not all the villagers know how to speak it.They find a man (named Henryk) butchering a pig and a girl (named Lidia) picking flowers and approach her. They show her a picture of Eric and ask if she has seen him. The girl is hesitant to answer and before she even can, Henryk (presumably her father) calls to her and sends her off. Carmen, Sara and Marcus explore the village. They notice that the villagers treat their religious leaders like royalty. They then spot a strange dense area of fog which seems to be concentrated only in one portion of the forest, also mentioned in Eric\u0027s notes. They are threatened by Henryk and the villagers and told to leave the village when they attempt to move toward the fog.Leaving the village initially, Carmen tells Marcus that they should go back and investigate the fog. Marcus disagrees and insist that they leave. But Carmen manages to convince Marcus to return. They leave their car and walk into the forest where they eventually find the area with the fog. Marcus takes pictures of the fog. Carmen, Sara and Marcus find it strange that the fog seems to never move and is quite dense, therefore preventing Marcus from taking pictures of anything inside the fog.Sara enters the fog and disappears into it. Carmen and Marcus wait for Sara to return but after awhile, they lose their patience. Marcus insist that they leave but they can\u0027t leave Sara behind. Carmen enters the fog to find Sara. Moments after she enters the fog, Sara somehow gets out and is found by Marcus. Sara appears to be a little scared and unfocused. Carmen seems to have gotten lose in the fog and comes across a statue of a demon holding a heart. Carmen takes a picture of it. As she moves to the side of the statue in order to take another picture, the statue seems to have turned its head to face Carmen. The statue\u0027s eyes bleed and the \u0027heart\u0027 in its hand start to beat. This frightens Carmen. As she backs away from the statue, she find herself out of the fog and is found by Marcus and Sara. Sara and Carmen talk about seeing the statue, both a bit disoriented, also having heard strange whispering voices.As they make their way back to their car, they come arcoss Lidia who claims to know the whereabouts of Eric and takes them to a hidden sacrificial tomb, where they discover the bodies of people (including Eric) whom the village people have executed. Each body has a metal mask deeply embedded on its face, making it look as though the villagers are cultists and are practicing some kind of ritual black magic on the tourists who come to Alvania. Marcus, Sara and Carmen notice that Lidia is gone and finds the door to the tomb jammed.Luckily, Marcus is able to open it but they are suddenly surrounded by the villagers. They struggle to escape but one of the villagers knocks out Carmen. Henryk shoots Sara\u0027s leg with a crossbow. The villagers knock her out with chloroform but not before she sees the one of the villagers\u0027 face turn into a demon. Marcus runs into the forest and is being chased by Henryk. Henryk catches up with him. Marcus fights Henryk but the latter gains the upper hand and knocks him out with chloroform.As they wake up, they see Henryk talking to Lidia. Lidia walks off and the villagers bring them back to the entrance of the sacrificial tomb where the head of the village\u0027s church, Arkadiusz, decides to sacrifice both Sara and Carmen. Sara and Carmen are taken inside the sacrificial tomb while Marcus is led away by two villagers and is forced to dig a grave at gunpoint. After one of them leaves, Marcus uses the shovel to disarm the remaining villager with the gun and knock him unconscious. He takes the gun and runs off to rescue Sara and Carmen.At the sacrificial tomb, Cultists strip Carmen and Sara and don them with ceremonial gowns. Henryk puts on the Cultists\u0027 robes. The Cultists place Sara on the same ceremonial table where Eric was killed while Carmen is placed in a prison cell. The Cultists secure her arms, legs and head. They then deeply lacerate her arms and sever her Achilles\u0027 tendons. While this is being done to her, she sees the faces of the Cultists and Arkadiusz turn into demons. The same mask they found on the corpses is placed over Sara\u0027s head. It has two spikes inside of it which are meant to pierce Sara\u0027s eyes and embed the mask on her face. Arkadiusz takes a sledgehammer and uses it to embed the mask on Sara, executing her in the process.One of the Cultists looks at Carmen and she sees that the Cultist\u0027s face become that of a demon as well. They bring her out to be sacrificed but Marcus rescues her. He locks the Cultists in the tomb and he and Carmen make their escape.They enter a villager\u0027s house to steal the keys to a truck. Marcus sees a woman, Emilia, and her son, Dariusz, in the kitchen. The woman calls for her husband, Aleks, but is unable to do anything since Marcus still has the gun. Marcus asks them for the keys to the truck but they can\u0027t understand English. When they see Carmen, Emilia expresses fear and panic. Marcus takes the family to their living room and ties up the couple.While Marcus tries to get them to give him the keys, Carmen starts to experience voices. She sees the objects in the room shake. She sees Daruisz turn into a demon and gaze at her. She sees Emilia and Aleks untie themselves and crawl on the floor and as demons. Marcus turns around to Carmen and he too becomes a demon. But in truth, all of them are still humanEmilia and Aleks are still tied up and none of them are even looking at her.Carmen goes to another room where she continues to see and hear things. Dariusz, who understands and speaks English, leads Marcus back to the kitchen and gives him the truck keys. Not wanting to risk Dariusz going out and call for help, Marcus also ties him up. The boy begs for Marcus to let them go and warns him that Carmen is evil since she has seen the statue. However, Marcus ignores him. Carmen is then possessed by a demon while she is alone in the room and lets out a very loud shriek. The Cultists, who have gotten free and are looking for Carmen, hear the shriek and are alerted of Carmen\u0027s location.Marcus hears Carmen calling out to him. He enters the room she went inside through a door from the kitchen. As he enters the room, another door leading back to the living room closes. Marcus hears Aleks and Emilia scream in fear and pain, followed by footsteps going to the kitchen. Marcus then hears Dariusz screaming. As he looks out from the door, he sees the boy being dragged on the floor. The door then closed before he could go out and Dariusz\u0027s screaming stops. The door leading to the living room slowly opens. He goes to the living room and finds the entire family brutally killed. A possessed Carmen then jumps on him and pins him on the floor. Just as she is about to kill Marcus, she is confronted by the Cultists. She kills several of them. Arkadiusz fights back with prayers and holy water. He calls for the mask but the Cultist holding the mask is stunned in fear, giving the possessed Carmen the opportunity to impale Arkadiusz. Carmen turns her attention back to Marcus.Before Arkadiusz dies, he passes on his duties to Henryk. Henryk chants prayers while splashing Carmen with holy water. Henryk stabs Carmen. The prayers weaken her, allowing Henryk to slowly set on her on the floor. Two more Cultists help. They impale Carmen\u0027s hands and pin her to the floor, making sure she does not get back up. Henryk calls for the mask and this time, the Cultist holding the mask complies. They position the mask over Carmen\u0027s face while Henryk readies the sledgehammer. However Carmen stills struggles and the mask can\u0027t be properly placed over her eyes.Marcus now realizes what is going on and understands why it was necessary to kill Sara and Carmen. Sara and Carmen saw the statue which is why the villagers decided to kill them but not Marcus. The Cultists weren\u0027t Cultists and they weren\u0027t sacrificing anyone. They were trying to prevent demonic possessions from taking place. Knowing this, Marcus helps out Henryk and the others. He holds Carmen\u0027s head still. With the mask now in place, Henryk readies the sledgehammer to embed the mask. Carmen returns to normal and asks Marcus for help but Marcus knows it is just a trick. Henryk sends the sledgehammer down and embeds the mask on Carmen, killing her.Marcus then looks at Henryk and the remaining men, wondering what will happen to him since he knows too much. One of the villagers asks Henryk on what they will do with Marcus. In the end, Marcus is set free by the villagers. Henryk offers to have one of the village\u0027s men take him to where he needs to go. Marcus looks over to the forest where the fog is seen. Not really knowing what is really inside the fog, he asks Henryk about it. He is told that the fog and the statue are a curse left long ago to the village that cannot be undone. The devillish statue is shown once more and the screen goes black.","numvotes":"13682","primarytitle":"The Shrine"},"color":"rgb(93,99,84)","size":2.0},{"source":"Thriller","target":"tt0065143","id":"6730","attributes":{"notes":"Giallo; other arts are more important","runtimeminutes":"96","sex of killer":"female","synopsis":"In the opening credits, a person, unseen except for a black-leather gloves and wearing a dark coat, takes photos of a young woman walking the streets of Rome.

Appointed official watchmaker to the viceroy, Oganelli was determined to perfect an invention which would   provide him with the key to eternal life. He was to name it the Cronos device. Four hundred years later, one night in 1937, part of a wall in a building collapsed. Amongst the victims was a man of strange skin, the color of marble in moonlight, his chest mortally pierced. His last words: Sua tempore. This was the alchemist. The authorities located the residence of the dead man. What they found there was never fully revealed to the public. After a brief investigation, the mansion and its contents were sold at public auction. Never on any list or inventory was the Cronos device mentioned. As far as anyone knew, it never existed.\"What was not revealed to the public was that a human male was found hanging from his feet, his blood draining into a basin. Also unknown to the public, except for a dying millionaire named de la Guardia [Claudio Brook] who will stop at nothing to obtain it, the Cronos device had been hidden in the base of a statue of an archangel. De la Guardia had spent his life acquiring old statues of archangels, always in search of the hidden Cronos device... so far in vain... until the day that the archangel shows up in the antique shop of Jesus Gris [Frederico Luppi]. Jesus and his granddaughter find the device and, not knowing what it is, Jesus activates it. He is horrified as claws protrude from the orb, hold fast to his hand and proceed to dig into   his flesh.Meanwhile, de la Guardia (who lives in an antiseptic chamber) sends his nephew Angel [Ron Perlman] to buy the archangel. When the statue proves to be empty, however, Angel is forced to take strong measures. He kills Jesus. Fortunately, Jesus has come to realize that the Cronos device confers immortality, and he uses it. But there is a cost. He begins to crave human blood, and his flesh starts peeling off, exposing a strange layer of skin, the color of marble in moonlight. In the final confrontation between Jesus, de la Guardia, and Angel, Jesus emerges victorious. Still, he smashes the Cronos device and goes home to Aurora and his girlfriend... to die. [Original synopsis by bj_kuehl]___   A voice over (Jorge Martínez de Hoyos) tells the story of Humberto Oganelli (Mario Iván Martínez), an Alchimist who arrived to Veracruz in Mexico running away from the Inquisition. In 1937, a building collapsed, and a grey-skinned men was discovered. It was Oganellli, the inventor of the Cronos device. He is supposed to die at that moment, impalled onto an iron stick. Every together renmant of that building was auctioned, including the small statue of an angel.Years later, the angel appears at the antiquarian\u0027s shop. Somebody (Luis Rodríguez) enters to look at it but leaves without buying it. Jesús Gris (Federico Luppi) has bought it. He realises that the angel is hollow, because, through one of the eyes\u0027 empty plaster socket, several huge bus fall down to the floor. Jesús picks up a kind of oval machinery thingy; it\u0027s the Cronos watch, a golden watch in the shape of a metal scarab. His mute granddaughter, Aurora (Tamara Shanath) is with him when he finds it.Ángel de la Guardia (Ron Perlman) is told where the angel statue is. In his turn, he tells his uncle, a millionaire De la Guardia (Claudio Brook) the news. De la Guardia wants the angel statue at all costs. Ángel buys it for him.Jesús wants to keep the watch. He sets the machiney onto motion. At first, it looks safe, but then 6 cocroach-like legs protude from the watch and make a hole on his hand. He doesn\u0027t let Aurora to get near the thing. His girlfriend Mercedes (Margarita Isabel), a tango-dance teacher, tends to his wound. She takes out a kind of metal sting from his hand and gives him some stiches.At night, Jesús doesn\u0027t feel very well. He goes to drink some water to the fridge, but the thing which attracts him the most is the bright red meat. Jesús feels restless. He sets the watch in motion again. A fourth sting comes out of the back side of the watch. That morning, the sun is shining outside. Jesús draws the curtains. His face looks much longer, but he shaves and he tells his girlfriend that he looks much younger because he has saved his white-haired moustache.When Jesús arrives to the shop, it has been vandalised. He contronts Ángel. He is frustrated because the archangel statue was hollow... and empty. De la Guardia tells him about the history of the Cronos mechanism. He also admits that he\u0027s dying of his sickness, and no treatment has worked so far. Jesús doesn\u0027t want to lose the Cronos. Jesús leaves on a hurry by the rooftop trying to look for Aurora, as he suddenly realises she\u0027s in danger. Aurora has picked up the Cronos to play with it. When he finds Aurora, he realises that she is frightened and tries to hide from him, or maybe she\u0027s scared about him, in any case she stops playing with her toy teaset and hides away from him. He tries to calm her down. She has hidden the Cronos inside her teddy bear. Immediately, Jesús uses the Cronos again, this time on his chest.Jesús is still guessing at the nature of the Cronos, but he feels that it\u0027s doing him good. His chest wound now expels a kind of mucose, and his eyes feel weird. Mercedes insists on his leaving the bathroom and go with her to the New Year\u0027s Eve party. Mercedes wonders how anyone can change so fast in such a short period of time. They dance in love there at the party. Aurora goes with them, but the girl usually stays on her own, silent as always. During the party, a man (Javier Álvarez) gets hurt and starts bleeding profusely. Jesús can\u0027t refrain from following that man to the gent\u0027s. They make small talk, but Jesús can\u0027t stop himself from staring at the spilled blood. He gets down on the floor to lick a blood stain. Somebody kicks him while he\u0027s doing that, knocking him out. The countdown to the first day of the year is being celebrated by everybody else. Meanwhile, Jesús is pushed out of the place where the party takes place.When he wakes up, he\u0027s in a car with Ángel, who beats him up. Ángel won\u0027t stop seeking the Cronos. Jesús asks what they want it for. Ángel leaves Jesús unconscious. Ángel pushes the car down from a cliff with Jesús inside.A funeral technician called Tito (Daniel Giménez Cacho) is preparing Jesús\u0027 corpse for burial. He is told that he\u0027ll be cremated, so all his excellent artistic work will be useless. De la Guardia tells off his nephew because he couldn\u0027t get the scarab and probably Jesús is still alive. Ángel goes to the funeral home and tries to wake Jesús up by closing his nostrils. Ángel leaves him for dead. Tito prepares the crematorium to burn the coffin - but there are problems with the gas and the piping, as all the tubes and pipes are really old and they would need maintenance. The technician leaves the room for some seconds to solve the problem. He doesn\u0027t realise that the coffee is empty, he just closes it down again without thinking about it. Ángel appears with the funeral house director (Juan Carlos Colombo) to enquire about the body of Jesús. The technician shows him the empty coffin burning to ashes in the oven. Ángel smiles.It\u0027s freezing. It\u0027s night. Jesús walks dazed confused and with a grey wounded face. He stops by a rubbish bin and he sees printed his own orbituary. Jesús tries to phone Mercedes. When he finally speaks up, Mercedes hangs up. Jesús limps home. It\u0027s Christmas and decorations are on the streets and the main hall of his building. He is opened the door by Aurora, who offers a towel for him. Jesús uses the Cronos mechanism again.Daylight really hurts him, so he hides inside an old trunk. Aurora paints the trunk and keeps on playing. Jesús writes a long letter to Mercedes. Jesús\u0027 faces is worst still. Jesús comes back to De la Guardia\u0027s warehouse, and he realises that Aurora has followed him. He tries to scare her away. She finds the little book written by Humberto Oganelli. There are some pages missing, and De la Guardia says that he\u0027s eaten them. De la Guardia takes off some pieces of dangling skin from Jesús\u0027 face nows feels metalic. De la Guardia rings the bell for his son. Ángel is pissed off at being disturbed by his uncle. De la Guardia tells Jesús that he needs to artifact to keep himself alive, and that he also needs blood. Jesús shows the Cronos to him and asks for the exit. De la Guardia knighs him. He fights with Jesús, but Aurora hits De la Guardia with a long stick. Jesús wakes up. Ángel appears and he tries to talk to his uncle. Jesús drinks the blood from De la Guardia\u0027s body. Ángel gets off from the lift and finds his uncle dead. Jesús and Aurora have hidden away. Ángel laughs with joy as everything will become his. However, at that moment, De la Guardia asks him for help, but his nephew kills him, fed up of being kept waiting. Jesús and Aurora hit Ángel. They run across the rooftops. He tells her granddaughter to leave by doing down the façade\u0027s ladder. Ángel hits Jesús. His victim looks week and unable to defend himself: he can only crawl away from him. To end the matter, Jesús throws himself agains Ángel\u0027s body, making him fall to the floor. Aurora sets the mechanism onto motion. Inside the scarab, a huge bag gives Jesús life. Aurora caresses Jesús\u0027 deformed face. Jesús peels off his own skin. Aurora was a bit hurt, so she\u0027s broken her lip. She offers her blood to Jesús, who finally decides to reject it with a supreme effort. Jesús shouts \"NO!\", and he removes the Cronos from his chest. He uses a stone to break it into pieces. He repeats his own name over and over again.Jesús dies, being cried by his granddaughter Aurora.---written by KrystelClaire","numvotes":"29759","primarytitle":"Cronos"},"color":"rgb(76,80,97)","size":2.0},{"source":"comes to life","target":"tt0020668","id":"7253","attributes":{"productioncompany":"Feature Productions","countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"6.4","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"The Bat Whispers","storyline":"Despite advance warning to the police, who seal off the area, The Bat, a master criminal, steals a necklace from the safe in the house of a rich socialite.

On his way through the village of Oakdale, the Bat notices someone robbing the Oakdale bank. Intrigued, the Bat follows the robber, who leads him to the old Fleming mansion.Inside the Fleming mansion, Cornelia van Gorder [Grayce Hamptom] and her ditzy maid Lizzie Allen [Maude Eburne] are discussing Cornelia\u0027s decision to rent the house for the summer. The big old house is a scary place, and Lizzie doesn\u0027t like the strange sounds, the strange caretaker [Spencer Charters], and the strange stories he tells about seeing ghosts in the house. Add to the fact that the Bat has taken to the country, and Lizzie is terrified of everything and anything. She\u0027s even gone so far as to set a bear trap outside her bedroom window, just in case the Bat decides to pay a vist. When Cornelia\u0027s niece Dale [Una Merkel], who works at the Oakdale Bank, returns home with her boyfriend Brook Bailey[William Bakewell] and tries to pass him off as a gardener, Cornelia is immediately suspicious (Cornelia: Any experience with alopecias? Brook: They dry up if you don\u0027t water them.), but Cornelia hires him anyway, at least until she can find out why Dale has brought him home.A rock suddenly comes crashing through the window. A note on it reads: Get out of the house now while there is still time. Immediately thereafter, Dr Venrees [Gustav von Seyffertitz] drops by to inform Cornelia that the Oakdale bank has been robbed of a half million dollars and that Fleming, Sr, the owner of the mansion, is returning from Europe so Cornelia will have to vacate the house. Then, a heavy painting moves, and a voice from behind warns them to get out of the house. Becoming concerned, Cornelia phones the police. When Detective Anderson [Chester Morris] shows up, Cornelia explains her suspicion that Fleming, Jr [Hugh Huntley] is trying to frighten her out of the house, possibly because he rented it to her while his father was out of the country. Nowthat his father is returning, she thinks he may be trying to frighten her into leaving.Soon everyone begins acting suspiciously. The doctor unlocks the broken window and \"forgets\" to relock it until Cornelia relocks it herself. Alone in the parlor for a few moments, Venrees unlocks the window again. Brook starts going around the house pounding on the walls. Dale phones Fleming Jr and asks him to come over. When he does, he brings a blueprint of the house so that they can locate a hidden room. Before they can find it, he is murdered, and Dale hides a piece torn from the blueprint under a tray. A storm is approaching, and the lightning knocks out the electricity. Someone phones from the garage, but when Det Anderson goes out to check, there is no one there. Detective Jones [Charles Dow Clark] arrives to help with the investigation. Dr Venrees finds the torn piece from the blueprint showing that the hidden room is behind a fireplace, but Det Anderson forces him to hand it over. When Anderson is poring over the blueprint, Venrees clobbers him with a heavy statue and locks his body in a closet. In the lightning flashes, the silhouette of the Bat can be seen peering into the window.It gets even more intriguing. Brook turns out to be a cashier from the bank and the primary suspect in the theft. Fleming Sr is seen walking on the roof when he\u0027s supposed to be out of the country. Dale finds the secret room behind a fireplace and gets locked in, along with the Bat, Mr Fleming Sr, and the money. The Bat shoots Fleming Sr. Dale escapes and leads Inspector Jones, Cornelia, and Dr Venrees to the secret room. Just as the fireplace swings open, Venrees blows out the candle, allowing whomever was in the room to escape. Finally, Inspector Anderson figures it out. Dr Venrees and Fleming Sr robbed the bank together and hid the money in the house. Anderson arrests Venrees and locks him in a closet.A strange man suddenly stumbles into the room. He\u0027s been hit in the head and is suffering from amnesia. He remembers only that he tried to phone from the garage. As they search the secret room for the money and find nothing, Cornelia thinks that she sees someone out on the roof and Anderson goes outside to catch him. Shortly thereafter, the garage is set afire. The amnesic man grabs a gun and orders everyone to be silent. The fire was set to get everyone out of the room, he explains, and the person who set that fire will be back shortly to get the money. They blow out the candles and wait. The Bat enters the house. The amnesic man points the gun at the Bat and orders Inspector Jones to disarm him. Just as they prepare to remove the black hood from the Bat\u0027s face, the Bat creates a distraction by knocking over a chair and escaping...right into the bear trap that Lizzie set so many hours ago.The Bat has been captured. They remove his hood to see that it\u0027s Detective Anderson. The amnesic explains that he is the real Detective Anderson, but he was clobbered in the garage by the Bat, who took his IDs. But the Bat isn\u0027t ready to be captured. While he extols his great intellect, he pulls out a gun he found on the ground and forces everyone to put up their hands. Only Cornelia refuses. I took the bullets out of that gun only ten minutes ago, she says. Everyone jumps on the Bat, and the gun goes off. Cornelia was lying!As the movie closes and the curtain falls on the stage, the Bat drops down from the ceiling. Chester Morris, who played Detective Anderson and the Bat, then addresses the audience. He asks them not to reveal the identity of the Bat to anyone and promises that, if they keep the secret, the Bat will not haunt their homes, steal their money, or frighten their children.

Her daughter Clare (Raegan Revord) goes to ride her bicycle with her dog Max. Johanna goes into the house looking spaced. When Clare comes home, she goes into the attic to find Johanna hanging herself.Teenage Clare (now played by Joey King) wakes up from this nightmare. She gets ready to go to school. Clare rides her bike to school and sees her Uncle August (Victor Sutton), whom her father won\u0027t let her speak to for some reason. Clare is distracted and nearly gets struck by popular girl Darcie Chapman (Josephine Langford). Clare just scrapes her knee and rips her legging.When Clare gets to school, she sees her father Jonathan (Ryan Phillipe) dumpster-diving with his friend Carl (Kevin Hanchard). Embarrassed, she goes to tell him to go away. Clare then joins her friends June Acosta (Shannon Purser) and Meredith McNeil (Sydney Park) while we see that Clare has a crush on popular guy Paul Middlebrook (Mitchell Slaggart).

Clare takes it inside and reads that the box will grant seven wishes. She scoffs it off.The next day, Clare is at school with June and Meredith when they are giggling as Darcie and her clique of mean girls walk by. Darcie questions Clare as to why she\u0027s laughing, and Clare says that she called Darcie \"ultimate smegma\", which is some kind of genital secretion in both males and females. Darcie smacks Clare, who smacks her back. Clare then gets knocked over, and she retaliates by tackling Darcie to the ground and engaging in a girl fight.When Clare goes home, she takes the music box and makes what she thinks is a hypothetical wish for Darcie to \"go rot\".The following morning, after an apparently crazy party in her home, Darcie wakes up to find part of her hands, feet, and face looking grotesquely rotted. The news spreads around the school that Darcie got necrotizing facilities from a spa, and that means Clare\u0027s wish has come true. However, the next morning, Clare goes to look for Max and finds his dead body under the deck in the house. She and Jonathan bury their dog.After spending a good part of her day pining for Paul, Clare decides to make her second wish be that Paul would fall madly in love with her. When she goes to school again, Paul approaches her and shows clear interest, even in front of his girlfriend Lola Sanchez (Daniela Barbosa).In Uncle August\u0027s home, the old man is preparing to take a bath. He fills his tub with water and steps in, only to clumsily slip and hit his head on the side of the tub. He regains consciousness, only to bang his head on the nozzle and die.Upon learning of August\u0027s death, Clare wonders to her father if August left his inheritance to anyone. Jonathan doubts he or Clare would have been mentioned. Considering that they aren\u0027t very financially stable at the moment, Clare goes to her room and tells the music box her third wish, which is that August had left her everything.Clare wakes up the next day to Jonathan telling her that August apparently left Clare his entire inheritance. Soon, the two move into a mansion and start driving flashy cars. Jonathan gives Clare his credit card so that she can treat June and Meredith to a shopping spree.Paul officially breaks up with Lola and immediately proceeds to ask Clare out. She takes some time to think about it.The Shannons\u0027 former neighbor Mrs. Deluca (Sherilyn Fenn) is in her home cooking dinner. She drops something down the garbage disposal and sticks her hand in there while precariously leaning close to the switch. Meanwhile, her pots on the stove appear to be burning. Mrs. Deluca pulls her hand out and turns off the stove. She then moves back toward the sink. Her ponytail goes down the disposal and she accidentally turns it on, causing the disposal to yank her hair and break her neck.Clare is still annoyed that her dad goes dumpster-diving for knick-knacks. She uses her fourth wish for Jonathan to be less embarrassing. Jonathan then becomes a smooth saxophone player that even Clare\u0027s friends find hot.Clare asks her friend Ryan Hui (Ki Hong Lee) for help in figuring out the phrase on the music box, as well as its history. They visit his cousin Gina (Alice Lee) in her loft. They find that the box has been passed down for decades, but they cannot translate the phrase. Gina sends the phrase to someone for an answer.That night, Gina is alone in her loft when she receives an email with the translation. She says it\u0027s messed up and it starts to freak her out. She tries to call Ryan outside but he doesn\u0027t answer the phone. The door behind her slams and causes her to drop her phone. She goes back inside as the power is out. In the darkness, she trips and falls face-first onto a the horn of a bull statue.At school, Clare is now Paul\u0027s girlfriend, but all of his friends don\u0027t care to hang out with her since Paul dumped Lola for her. Clare then wishes that she would become the most popular girl in school. She then gets invited to a party with Paul where they have a good time and go to his car to hook up, only for Clare to realize Paul is talking to other girls behind her back, as well as spying on her and taking pictures. She leaves Paul.Ryan finds Gina\u0027s phone on the ground and runs up to her loft to find her dead. He finds Clare at school and tells her that he learned the phrase on the box translates to \"When the music ends, the blood price is paid.\" He tells Clare that Gina is dead. Ryan also tells Clare that he\u0027s learned more about the box\u0027s history. Those who have used it all ended up dead. He refers to a man (Jerry O\u0027Connell) who used the box\u0027s wishes to make his life better, only for his wife and children to perish. He burned his house down with himself and the box inside, but the box survived. Clare and Ryan do what they can to destroy the box themselves (burning it, hitting it with sledgehammers, etc), but nothing works.Clare goes to Mrs. Deluca\u0027s home and enters to a horrible smell. She then finds Mrs. Deluca\u0027s dead body still lingering by the sink.Clare tells June and Meredith about the box and how she\u0027s been making wishes. Meredith chides her for not using wishes on good things instead of using them on herself. June encourages Clare to get rid of the box. Clare goes to do so, but then decides to keep the box just in case.While Clare is sleeping at night, she finds Paul has broken into her room. He asks her if it\u0027s over between them. Clare makes it obvious that it is, and he slits his wrist. He is later taken to the hospital.The girls hang out at a hotel. Clare gets a phone call from Jonathan saying he\u0027s going to a gig, and he soon gets a flat tire. The scene jumps between Jonathan changing his tire and Meredith going off by herself to play a phone app. Clare admits to June that she didn\u0027t get rid of the box. Meredith then sets foot in an elevator to rejoin her friends. Jonathan is nearly struck by two drag racers. He goes under the car to grab a missing piece, with the car jack nearly loosening itself. Finally, he knocks the spare tire loose, which gets hit by an oncoming car and nearly tears Jonathan\u0027s head off. The elevator that Meredith is on then malfunctions before dropping completely and crashing to the bottom, killing Meredith. June blames Clare for this.Clare struggles with the result of her wishes and the thought of undoing them. Eventually, the wishes are undone when Clare and Jonathan have their money taken because Uncle August never paid his taxes. They move back into their old home. Darcie returns to school with her skin healing and she\u0027s still a bitch to Clare. Clare finds out that June took the box from her room to try and get rid of it but Clare takes it back.Utterly frustrated and losing her mind, Clare tries to resist making another wish, but she makes her sixth wish be that her mother never committed suicide. Seconds later, she hears Johanna\u0027s voice. Clare embraces her mother for the first time in years. It also turns out that in this new time line, Clare has younger twin sisters. The happiness is short-lived Clare sees Jonathan outside under a tree as Carl is trying to chop off a branch with a chainsaw. Clare runs outside to warn her dad, only for Carl\u0027s ladder to wobble, causing him to accidentally swing the chainsaw down and decapitate Jonathan. Clare runs up to the attic and among her mom\u0027s paintings, she finds one of the same box, leading her to realize her mom once had the same box and it was responsible for her suicide. Clare screams at the box that she wants to use her last wish to go back to the day that her dad found the box.Clare wakes up on that fateful day. Max is on her bed. She calls Meredith to hear her voice, though she\u0027s annoyed that Clare woke her up. Clare asks Jonathan if she can join him and Carl as they go looking for things. Clare finds the box in a bin and wraps it in a sheet, taking it with her. Before going to school, she tells her dad she loves him.Clare finds Ryan and gives him the box, saying how she knows Gina and that she can figure out what the box says and that they should get rid of it. She also makes dinner plans with Ryan and kisses him in front of June and Meredith. Clare walks off happily... and then Darcie accidentally hits her with her car, sending Clare\u0027s body flying several feet and crashing onto a windshield. All the students look on in horror as Clare lays dead on the windshield of the other car.In the after credit scene, Ryan is seen finishing digging up a hole to bury the box. Then he looks around and takes out the box from the bag in which Clare handed it over to him saying never to open to see what\u0027s inside and to bury it so nobody could find it.

After the funeral, the six leave the graveyard and go to their friend\u0027s home. Following instructions in their friend\u0027s will, they look for and find a box containing a letter and a map. The map marks the location of a time capsule that the group buried together many years ago. The letter apologizes for the friend\u0027s suicide but asks that the remaining friends face the past and the things forgotten together. The letter ends by reminding them that they will always be together. The only other item in the box is an old photograph of eight children standing in front of a baseball field. Brent comments that their group must not have been very bright since a baseball team requires at least nine players, not eight, but Lyle chides him by saying that Crazy Eights was simply a name.The six travel to their childhood hometown and use the map to find an old, dilapidated barn, where the time capsule has been placed in the upper level. The group opens the box to find various items that they owned in their youth, including Beth\u0027s paint brushes, a journal (which once belonged to the deceased friend), a slingshot, and a few other items. They decide to move the box outside by using a pulley to carry it out of a nearby window. While Jennifer, Lyle and Brent are attempting to lift the box out, Beth and Wayne talk outside. Beth notices a new scar on Wayne\u0027s forehead; when she asks him about it, he confesses that he does not know how he got it, and that the cut appeared right after a disturbing nightmare he had. Suddenly, the box drops behind them and smashes, having slipped from the pulley.When the group goes to the box again, they find that the bottom has split open, revealing a secret compartment which contains the skeleton of a tiny girl. The group is unsure of what to do, debating whether to simply leave or to involve the authorities. Brent angrily leaves the group, refusing to accept any responsibility or consequences for the unknown skeleton.Upon realizing that Brent still has the keys to the van, the others quickly catch up to him, although they are still undecided as to what to do about the box and its grisly contents. As the group attempts to drive away, they find themselves lost and continually returning to a large white house no matter which direction they travel in. Brent notices a figure standing near a few trees surrounding the house, and quickly leads the group to her location. The girl disappears once the group heads towards her, so they decide to enter the home to search for her. The group agrees to split up into two groups, in the hopes of finding the girl faster.Wayne and Gina walk around outside and find the entrance to the basement. Upon entering, Wayne just makes out the shadow of a person, but falls down the stairs and breaks his leg. Gina turns the basement\u0027s lights on as Wayne begs her not to leave him alone in the dark, and sets out for help. Meanwhile, the group inside sees that the house does not look as though anyone has lived there for a long time; Brent soon discovers a \"Condemned\" notice, stating that all trespassers will be shot without warning. Gina finds the others and notifies the rest of the group of Wayne\u0027s injury, and the group descends into the basement to aid Wayne, with Brent bringing anything from the van that might help them.Once all members of the group are in the basement, the door strangely shuts and locks. The group, now looking for any way out of the house, leave with Wayne in tow and travel down a tunnel which they hope will lead them to another exit. The tunnel opens out into an abandoned underground hospital, complete with an empty nurse\u0027s station and rooms with hospital beds. The group decides to split up again to search for an exit or anything that might help them. The group leaves Wayne in Beth\u0027s care, but she soon abandons Wayne to explore the halls and rooms. She stares into a mirror hanging off a wall at the nurse\u0027s station, and is startled to see her younger self staring back at her.Meanwhile, the abandoned Wayne hears a noise behind him and crawls over to a nearby window to investigate, the window inexplicably opened even though the outside is covered by bars. Behind him, a ghostly figure passes by and the window is suddenly closed, killing Wayne. The group soon returns to find Wayne\u0027s body, and upon managing to get him out, temporarily transfer it to the attic. Lyle and Gina take an obviously disturbed Beth to a room serving as a bedroom for multiple children in order to calm her down.Beth demands to be left alone, and Lyle and Gina reluctantly comply. When left alone, Beth begins sucking her thumb, and lies on a bed. Soon, a horrible creature visits, promising to remove her guilt if she \" reaches down, and pulls it out.\" Beth screams in response, and when the other five reenter the room, they find Beth\u0027s bloody body lying crumpled against a wall with her jaw torn off. This is eerily similar to the fate of Beth\u0027s sculpture she had crafted at the beginning of the story.Brent panics and flees the room, running away from the remaining members of the group. He enters a series of adjoined, lighted rooms, before discovering that again, the series of rooms loop in circles, with no exit. Brent yells and curses at whoever is tormenting him, and promises that when he escapes the building, he will burn it to the ground.Brent eventually returns to the other four. Gina, Lyle and Brent return to the room where they saw her reflection and break the mirror, discovering that it was a two-way mirror used to watch the previous occupants of the home. Brent somehow finds an exit, which leads to a room filled with a plethora of toys, and a large painting on the wall. Brent explains that \"compassion is the difference between a man and a beast.\" The remainder of the group walks along the length of the hall exposed by the broken mirror, eventually arriving at a room containing records. The records document the progress of \"subjects,\" among which were a savant and an autistic individual.Lyle comes to the conclusion that they were trying to teach these unfortunate subjects guilt. However, Jennifer rampages through the room and exposes a large butterfly graffiti made by the group when they were children. They discover a picture frame containing pictures of all of them as children, including the man who each child believed was his or her own father.Brent, meanwhile, drops to his knees and reads several quotes from a book in the time capsule, talking about how they cannot run. He comes to some sort of realization but a figure emerges from a pile of toys behind him and kills him before he can express it. Lyle suddenly recollects old, repressed memories hidden by pain and horror, about how the group of eight children escaped this home, where they had been experimented on.He recounts how they were forced to leave one of the members of the group, a fragile young girl named Karen, in a chest containing meaningful objects, promising to return and rescue her. He realizes that the time capsule is the chest, and that they had come back for the girl long ago, only to find her dead from suffocation. Gina, horrified by this realization, runs into a bathroom, vomiting in the toilet. The bathroom is filled with multiple bathtubs, and she leans against one, moaning. Suddenly, the horrible creature who took the lives of Wayne, Beth, and Brent emerges behind her and blinds her by gouging her eyes out. She begins to scream as Lyle and Jennifer race towards the bathroom, but the door is locked.Lyle and Jennifer manage to batter their way into the room, and quickly bind Gina\u0027s bleeding eyes with strips of cloth. They take her to the storage room, and leave her there, promising to return soon. Lyle convinces Jennifer that they must find and destroy all objects linking them to the dead girl, and implores her to split up to find the objects in a reduced amount of time. Gina reminds Lyle that Brent left a slingshot under a grate, near a truncated tunnel. Lyle finds the area, and reaches down to acquire the slingshot, when a hand grabs his. He quickly struggles and stumbles back, severely wounding his neck on a pike.Meanwhile, Jennifer finds a paintbrush under a filthy bed, and begins to walk back to the room where Gina is. The blinded Gina, unaware of her surroundings and left with a metal bar to defend herself, inadvertently kills Lyle when he enters the room. In Lyle\u0027s last breaths, he tells Gina that yet another object is in the tunnel. Gina runs back to the entrance of the basement, where a horrible creature behind her clasps its hand over Gina\u0027s mouth, suffocating her. Jennifer returns to the room, finding Lyle dead. She pleads for the resurrection of the dead man, before gathering the courage to burn the slingshot and the paintbrush in a garbage can.While burning the objects, the horrible creature (who is revealed to be Karen, the dead girl\u0027s spirit) who led the other group members to their deaths, taunts Jennifer, reminding her of how she left her in the chest. Jennifer asks, with a raising temper in her voice, what objects are left to burn.When she does not receive an answer, she deduces that she herself is the only thing left connected to Karen. While Jennifer prepares to plunge a shard of glass into her stomach to kill herself, a flashback is shown where a man talks to Karen about the \"project\" is shown, and the movie abruptly ends with the words, \"Do you know the meaning of guilt? Do you know the meaning of redemption?

Mother Rukh (Violet Kemble Cooper), seated in a chair, inquires whether her son Dr. Janos Rukh (Boris Karloff) is still working in his lab. Diane confirms this, saying that he is preparing for the delegation of scientists due to arrive from England. Rising from her chair with help from Diane, Mother Rukh comes to the window with her cane. She tells Diane that on a day like this her son Janos discovered the ray from Andromeda while working with his late father. It was holding the lens during that discovery which caused her permanent blindness. They discuss the brilliance of Janos and how he was rejected by other scientists and called a charlatan. Diane says she was told to watch for the headlights coming and notify Janos. Mother Rukh returns to her seat and Diane looks out the window again. Seeing the car approaching, she announces that she will go tell her husband. She dons her cape and goes through an outer walkway to another building where she rings a bell and enters. Coming into the lab, she tells Janos (who is gazing through a large telescope) that the visitors are arriving. He says he is ready and confident.The car pulls up and several people get out and enter the house. Diane greets Lady Arabella Stevens (Beulah Bondi) who introduces her husband Sir Francis Stevens (Walter Kingsford), Dr. Felix Benet (Bela Lugosi) and her nephew Ronald Drake (Frank Lawton). They are introduced to Mother Rukh who speaks but remains seated. Janos enters and greets each one and is greeted by Lady Arabella who presents her nephew Ronald who she says is a mapmaker and will be valuable to the work in Africa. Janos tells them he has a presentation to show them.In the lab, he shows his telescope, explaining and showing a device which will capture a ray from Andromeda containing pictures and information from thousands of years ago. Dr. Benet looks at Sir Francis with a knowing look of doubt between them. Janos attaches the device to the telescope and tells them to wait a few moments while he prepares the projector. Coming back from another room wearing a welding mask, he reaches into a panel and starts a series of electrical devices which give off sparks and energy. He announces he is ready. Diane leads the way to seats which are protected from dangerous rays by a new kind of barium crown glass, which is explained by Janos. He tells them about the distances the ray has traveled and turns on the projector, which is the type used in planetariums to show outer space. As he narrates, the picture shows a movement that passes our moon, Saturn, Orion and finally Andromeda. He tells Sr. Francis that he had previously predicted a meteor which struck Earth many years ago in Africa, telling him that this will prove it. As they watch, the view changes direction back toward Earth as seen from Andromeda but millions of years ago. A meteor is shown hurtling towards Earth and striking in the southern portion of Africa. Those viewing this are stunned. Various comments are made, saying this is no hoax.Back in the house, brandy is served. Sir Francis marvels at the discovery to Janos, asking when he will publish it to the scientific world. He says it is not yet ready. Sir Francis says it would be good to locate this meteor and see what it contains. Dr. Benet suggests that Janos join them in an expedition. Janos says he has no standing before their scientific congress and that he had previously been declared unorthodox and discredited. Sir Francis tells him their expedition will not be under the auspices of any scientific association. Dr. Benet says that he will be doing them an honor. Janos accepts, but Mother Rukh tells him no. She says he may make an important discovery but that it will not bring him happiness. She reminds him that Janos is not good with people but is better suited to remain with his experiments.A scientific magazine is shown that has an article about Dr. Benets expedition to Africa to recover Radium X. It mentions that Dr. Rukh has separated from the others. Meanwhile, at a camp in Nigeria, Dr. Benet shows Sir Francis how he has been healing natives by a medicine he derived from sunlight. A young native child is shown and given back to his mother. Diane sits in her tent, hot, tired and bored to death since her husband left them to go on his own expedition. She emerges from her tent only to see Lady Arabella and Ronald returning from a hunting trip. Seeing him stirs her. She turns away, not wanting to look. A conversation with Ronald and Lady Arabella about Diane reveals that they are interested in each other, but that Ronald dares not act because she is married. Meanwhile Sir Francis says he is sick of staying in Africa and will not remain for the sake of anyone.A safari group accompanying Janos arrives near a volcano when suddenly a loud buzzing and clicking sound coming from one of the boxes carried by a native frightens him. It is revealed to be a Giger counter showing the presence of radioactivity. Janos takes the machine and approaches a site giving off steam or smoke. He tells the leader to send a message back to the camp by his fastest runner. A runner is selected by the leader and Janos writes out a message, telling him to give it to Diana and wait for an answer. He says he has found what he is looking for, but not to tell anyone where they are.Antelope stew is served at the camp, but not everyone is interested in eating. Diane and Ronald avoid glances over the table at each other, but it is obvious that they are mutually interested in each other and this causes great discomfort. About this time the runner arrives and the note is given to Diane, who reads it. She reports only that Janos will not return right away but believes he is on the right track. Going to her tent, she asks the leader to meet with her and the runner. A small team is prepared to accompany her to see her husband. This is observed by Ronald, who then confronts Diane of her plans. She tells him she must go to her husband right away. He tells her hes not surprised that she wouldnt disappoint any man.Dressed in a protective suit and helmet, Janos is lowered into the volcano by rope controlled by natives. He uses a mining hammer to extract a sample of glowing, sparkling rock which he puts into a safe container. Returning to the natives, he is told they do not like the area because there are many devils. After the leader tells him they all want to leave, he tells them to watch a rock standing alone on a precipice. Loading the rock sample into a projector, he focuses it on the rock and shines the beam. The rock is disintegrated and melted before their eyes. He tells them they may leave if they want to, but threatens to turn the ray on them if they do. They beg and pledge their continued support.That night a meal is brought to Janos by one of the natives. He tells him to take the lantern inside the tent so it will not attract bugs. When the light is taken away, Janos begins glowing in his hands and face. Seeing this, the native cries out in horror. Janos sees his hands glowing and enters the tent. Turning down the lantern, he grabs a mirror and sees his face glowing. When the light is turned on, the glow cannot be seen. He remarks to himself that it has poisoned him. Sitting down on his cot to think, the dog approaches him and he reaches to pet it. The dog dies, and Janos realizes that his touch is deadly.Diane and her party arrive and she is pointed toward his tent. Seeing her coming, Janos draws the tent closed and turns out his lantern, hoping she will not enter. She notices the light go out and stops at the tent door to call him. Not wanting her to see or touch him, Janos questions why she came and tells her she must leave in the morning. She is shown a tent for her to stay the night, but is heartbroken and cries upon her cot. Janos gathers up the rock sample along with his mask and protective suit and starts out into the dark. Passing close by her tent, he hears her sobbing and pauses.Dr. Benet is shown mixing chemicals in his tent. Wearing full protective gear, Janos shows up with the runner and calls out to Benet, entering the tent. He tells Benet not to touch him, saying that he found the element and it is ten times more powerful than radium but that it has poisoned him. They step outside into the darkness and Benet witnesses Janos hands and face glowing. Confessing that his touch is deadly, they re-enter the tent. Janos asks Benet for help. Benet says there is an antidote for radium poisoning which is made from radium. Janos gives him a sample of the element and his chemical analysis which he has written down. Benet says he will begin at once to develop an antidote and that Janos can hide in a small equipment tent.Diane leaves on her way back to base camp. Meanwhile, Dr. Benet wakes Janos, and shows him in the dark that his skin no longer glows. He tells him that the antidote was given him at midnight and that the effect is only temporary. Touching his hand, he demonstrates that Janos is not lethal at this time, but cautions him that he must take doses of this daily for the rest of his life or the condition will recur and eventually kill him. Janos is given the formula on paper as well as a kit containing samples of the antidote and a syringe.Diane and Ronald have a discussion about their relationship, saying there is no point in denying it now. At this point a bell rings, calling them to supper.Natives sound jungle drums. Dr. Benet arrives at Janos camp and approaches him. When asked how Benet found him, he is told they followed the sound of the drums, which stated that a white man had found magic in the mountains. They go into the tent and Janos tells him that he has harnessed the power of the element to destroy cities. Benet asks if he can develop its power to heal and do good. Saying that will come later, he brags about his great discovery. Benet tells him that this was anticipated by himself and Sir Francis and that they must all share the discovery. Benet says Stevens is on his way to present the sample to the International Scientific Congress meeting in Paris. Janos argues that it is his discovery and says they are stealing it from him. Benet assures him that Janos will receive credit for it but reminds him they are united for a common purpose and that this element is too powerful and important to entrust to just one man. He says that Diane has taken ill and gone back to England. Janos is given a note from his wife, telling him that she believes that he no longer loves her and is now involved with someone else. Benet confirms that it is Drake. This further infuriates Janos, who tells Benet to leave before he turns the ray on him. Benet leaves.A newspaper shows that the Benet expedition has left Africa and that Dr. Rukh has returned to his lab in the Carpathian Mountains. Inside, Janos turns the ray on his mothers eyes, hoping to restore her sight. After a few moments, she confirms that she can see. She tells him he has much work to do, but he tells her he is leaving in the morning for Paris. She warns him not to go, for he will find tragedy there. In case of tragedy, he says, keep the formula which he has written down and sealed in an envelope for his mother to keep.In Paris we see Dr. Benet in his office who sees many patients, using the ray to heal. One girl has her sight restored and she and her parents rejoice. At this moment Janos arrives and Benet tells him that his discovery is helping to heal many people. Benet tells Janos that the Nobel Prize has been awarded to Janos and that all Paris is waiting to honor him. Janos says it looks like he is late again and declares that only he can correctly harness its power. Benet reminds him that is why the discovery was too important to entrust to just one man. Saying the counter-active is still working, Janos asks about Diane. He is told that she is working for Lady Arabella and that she and Ronald are in love. Benet tells him that Diane will do nothing until she hears from Janos. He replies that will happen soon enough and leaves.Wandering through the city, Janos finds a man who looks like himself and promises to help the man. About the same height and build, they go off together.Lady Arabella is seen dictating to Diane, who types onto paper. The maid comes bringing the newspaper and giving it to Arabella. She reads the headline and gives it to Diane. It shows that Dr. Rukh has been found dead, his body mutilated by the effects of the Radium X.Diane and Ronald are seen at their wedding at the Church of the Six Saints. As they are leaving, Janos watches from a distance as they get into a car to leave. He looks up at the statues of the six saints and pictures each of them as representing himself, Benet, Diane, Ronald, Arabella and Francis. Taking a room facing the church, he plots to kill each of the other five people.At the Stevens home, Arabella is talking to Benet about the marriage and noted that Sir Francis has not come down from his room. She sends the butler up to see about him. Before the butler can get halfway up the stairs, one of the maids comes screaming into his arms. He goes up to see while Arabella questions the maid. She cannot speak but only screams. Rushing back down, the butler calls for Dr. Benet to come, saying only  Sir Francis! Sir Francis!. Entering his room, they find Francis dead on his bed with a look of horror on his face. Dr. Benet asks for an ultraviolet camera which he uses to shoot pictures of Francis eyes. Developing them, he sees captured in the reflection on the mans cornea the image of Janos.The next day there is a disturbance in the square below. The landlady (May Beatty) brings Janos his breakfast and the morning paper, telling him that one of the statues was destroyed. He sees in the paper the death of Sir Francis. Gazing at the second statue, he calls the name of Lady Arabella.The next day the papers announce the death of Lady Arabella, the third death in wake of the curse of Radium X. Diane and Ronald come into the bedroom where Dr. Benet and the authorities are with the body. He tells Diane not to look and for Ronald to take her away. Then he asks to show the Chief of the Surete (Georges Renavent) some evidence. As the lights are turned out, the cover is pulled back to reveal a glowing handprint on the victims neck. Benet says it was done by someone poisoned by Radium X. Meanwhile Diane blames herself for the deaths, saying they would all still be alive if she hadnt come on the expedition and married Ronald. He tells her not to think like that, saying he will fight with all his strength. She says how can you fight something you cannot see or touch?The paper headline shows that the second statue has been destroyed and people are upset. A discussion is held with Benet, Ronald and the Chief about Janos. It is suggested that the two men go into hiding. Ronald proposes a trap to draw Janos so they can arrest him. Benet says for the papers to announce that the remaining three will leave for an unknown destination after holding a lecture on Benets experiments with Radium X. He will invite distinguished scientists who will only be admitted by card which the police promise to verify. Benet warns that if the police fail to stop him at the gate that the house lights will be darkened at midnight (the time of the lecture) so that Janos can be seen glowing. It is a risk they are willing to take.The night of the lecture, the police are seen checking the cards of each scientist who enters. In the rain the last scientist, Professor Meiklejohn (Frank Reicher) is seen walking with his umbrella. Janos appears and stops him, introducing himself as someone else who remembers his lecture on radiology. Saying he is on the way to the lecture, the Professor locates his card in his pocket. Janos suggests they have a drink of Napoleon Brandy from his flask. They step aside and the flask is handed to him to drink. The touch kills Meiklejohn, who collapses. Janos takes the card and enters in his place. The police confirm him and he enters but remains outside so he can observe through a window.Inside, Benet greets everyone and tells them he must make final adjustments. Entering his lab with a gun, Benet looks around and heads for the outside door, opening it. Janos comes in and confronts him. The light is turned off, showing his glowing face and hands. Janos tells him he will kill the remaining three. Benet asks if he ever feels like he used to before the poison altered his brain. Janos answers  not often now.. When Benet reaches for his gun, Janos grabs his arm, killing him.Diane waits upstairs but is very anxious to come down. There is a knock at the door and it is opened, revealing Mother Rukh entering. Ronald greets her and she is told that Diane is upstairs. At that moment the lights are cut in the whole place. Diane lights a candle and Janos is seen going upstairs with his glowing face. She rushes into the bedroom and tries to close the door but he forces it open. He approaches to try and touch her but hesitates. Trying again, he announces he is unable to kill her and goes out. She faints. Outside on the landing, he faces his mother who tells him he broke the first rule of science. He says he needs time so he can kill Drake, taking out his kit for more of the antidote. As he does this, Mother Rukh strikes it with her cane tip, destroying the contents. As he begins to smoke, he tells her that maybe its better this way. Turning away, he goes upstairs and crashes through a window, falling to the ground below as a fireball. There is nothing left. The head of the Scientific Congress congratulates Mother Rukh for her sons work.

Betty plans to roast him in her oven and serve him at a dinner party for more of her witch friends. To pass the time in his cell, Betty had given Timmy an old, thick book called \"Tales From the Darkside\". When she reveals her plans for him, Timmy begins to stall her by reading her some of the stories.The first story is called \"Lot 249\". At a prestigious university, a nerdy student, Bellingham, is bullied by two rich students, Susan and Lee, who are quite contemptuous of him because he\u0027s a work-study student. Susan\u0027s brother, Andy, helps Bellingham one night with a new specimen that has arrived in the archeology department: an ancient mummy. Speaking about how the ancient Egyptians would draw the corpse\u0027s brains out through it\u0027s nose with a hook and stuff vegetables into it\u0027s abdomen, Bellingham finds the incision in the mummy\u0027s abdomen where his preparers had stuffed him with herbs and onions. Bellingham also finds an ancient scroll and remarks that it\u0027s fairly worthless. Andy leaves and Bellingham reads the scroll, finding a spell that will bring the mummy to life to be his servant. Bellingham been cheated out of a teaching assistant\u0027s position in his department, an incident that somehow involved both Susan and Lee.Bellingham brings the mummy to life and sends it after Lee. It stalks Lee through his apartment, finally cornering him and forcing a hooked wire hanger up his nose, killing him. Susan returns home to find Lee\u0027s brain on a table in the front hall and Lee himself partially wrapped in cloth bandages. The mummy attacks her, chasing her through the house, where she becomes lodged in the broken window of the front door. The mummy uses a large pair of scissors and slashes her back open, stuffing the wound with flowers from a vase.Andy goes to Lee and Susan\u0027s place and finds them both dead. Suspicious of Bellingham, he goes to Bellingham\u0027s apartment and find him there with the mummy. He knocks Bellingham unconscious and ties him up. When Bellingham comes to, Andy demands that he turn over the scroll. Bellingham refuses at first and then begins to recite the incantation to bring the mummy to life and attack Andy. Andy is able to defend himself quite easily with an electric carving knife, dismembering the mummy. Bellingham finally directs Andy to a scroll, which he burns in the fireplace, along with the mummy\u0027s limbs. Bellingham ultimately leaves the university. While he rides away in a cab, he chuckles to himself. The driver asks him what he\u0027s laughing about \u0026 Bellingham tells him that a person like Andy would never know the difference between one ancient scroll and another - the scroll he reads is the actual one from the mummy. He recites from it and rides off. Later, Andy answers his door and finds Susan and Lee standing there, re-animated as mummies, ready to kill him.Back in Betty\u0027s kitchen, she tells Timmy that she knows he\u0027s trying to stall his death. Timmy convinces her to let him tell another story and she listens to him read \"Cat From Hell.\"Halston, a high-priced assassin, arrives at an old mansion, having been summoned there by an old man in a wheelchair, Drogan. Drogan tells Halston that he has an unusual mark for him to dispatch: a black cat. The cat has supposedly killed Halston\u0027s sisters, Carolyn and Amanda. Both sisters had befriended the cat, feeding it and showing it affection over Drogan\u0027s objections that it was evil. Carolyn was killed when the cat, sitting on a staircase riser, tripped over it and fell to her death. Amanda had been killed when the cat laid on her face while she was asleep.Halston is skeptical. Drogan introduces him to the cat, which sits quietly in Halston\u0027s lap for a few minutes. When Halston smirks at the ease of such a lucrative job, he tries to strangle the cat. The cat slashes him with it\u0027s claws and escapes. Drogan tells Halston that his pharmaceutical company had tested a new medication on thousands of subjects, all of them cats. He now believes the cat has been sent to take revenge on him and his family.Drogan leaves the house, bidding Halston to kill the cat by the time he comes home and also suggesting he not get angry, which will cloud his ability to kill it. Drogan checks over his weapons and tries several methods of killing the cat, all of which fail. When the cat leaps at him and scratches his neck, Halston becomes furious. At one point he tricks the cat into approaching and eating from a dish of food - he uses a laser sighting scope to target the cat, fires his pistol and misses. Fully enraged, Halston chases the cat through the house. The cat, suddenly leaping on to and knocking Halston down, then forces itself into his mouth, crawls down his esophagus and roosts in his stomach.Just before the stroke of midnight, Drogan returns and finds Halston dead on the floor. The cat crawls out of Halston\u0027s body and leaps onto Drogan\u0027s lap. Drogan has a heart attack and dies.In Betty\u0027s kitchen, Betty herself is impatient with Timmy, who persuades her to listen to one final story from the book, \"Lover\u0027s Vow\".An out-of-work artist, Preston, is being told by his agent that he can\u0027t help him if he can\u0027t overcome his creator\u0027s block. The two leave the bar they\u0027d met at; in the alley outside, Preston\u0027s friend is attacked by a monstrous gargoyle, who decapitates the man with one slash of it\u0027s claws. Preston shrinks in terror, begging for his life. The gargoyle makes him promise that he\u0027ll never speak of what he saw or the creature that committed the murder. The gargoyle also slashes Preston\u0027s body as a reminder. Preston promises to keep his vow and the beast flies off.On his way home Preston meets a beautiful woman, Carola. Telling her that the neighborhood is dangerous, he takes her home with him. The two have sex together and fall in love, eventually marrying and having a boy and a girl. Preston also finds that his creativity has returned and he enjoys a successful period of production. However, he is still torn with guilt over the murder of his friend and occasionally draws pictures of the beast, which he is careful to keep from Carola and his children.By the time 10 years have passed since Preston witnessed the murder, he decides to tell Carola about the night he met her. He shows her a small sculpture of the gargoyle he\u0027d kept hidden. When Carola sees it, she lets out a mournful scream and begins to transform, saying that Preston had broken his promise - she, herself, is the gargoyle. Preston is shocked and horrified, even more so when their children begin to transform into gargoyles themselves. Carola tells him she\u0027s sorry and kills him. She gathers her children together and flies off, breaking through their skylight and settling on a high ledge of a nearby building. They turn to stone, staring mournfully down at Preston\u0027s body.Back in the witch\u0027s kitchen, Betty tells Timmy his time\u0027s up. She approaches him with a butcher knife and the keys to his cell and shackles. Timmy frantically tells her he has one more story to tell, one not from the book. Timmy throws some marbles in Betty\u0027s path and she slips on them, falling backwards on to the skewers she\u0027d set out. Timmy manages to reach the keys while Betty struggles in pain and he frees himself. He gives her a hard shove, sending her into her own oven, which he slams shut, roasting her alive.

While wealthy, charming, generally intelligent and very handsome, he is naive and easily manipulated. These faults lead to his spiral into sin and, ultimately, misery.While posing for a painting by his artist friend Basil Hallward (Lowell Gilmore), Dorian meets Basil\u0027s friend Lord Henry Wotton (George Sanders). Wotton is enchantingly cynical and witty, and tells Dorian that the only life worth living is one dedicated entirely to pleasure. After Wotton convinces Dorian that youth and beauty will bring him everything he desires, Dorian openly wishes that his portrait could age in his place, and that he could keep his youthful good looks forever. He makes this statement in the presence of a certain Egyptian statue, which supposedly has the power to grant wishes. When the portrait of Dorian is complete, Lord Henry hails it as a masterpiece and is surprised when Basil announces he will never exhibit it because he feels he put \"too much of himself\" into it. Basil is also concerned about Lord Henry\u0027s influence on the impressionable Dorian, who Basil considers a dear friend and an artistic muse. Basil gives the painting to Dorian, who proudly hangs it in his opulent home.One fateful night, Dorian visits a lower-class tavern, The Two Turtles, where he is given a prime seat for the night\u0027s entertainment. He is instantly charmed by the tavern owners\u0027 daughter, Sibyl Vane (Angela Lansbury), who performs a sweet singing routine during the lineup. Dorian is invited backstage after the show to meet Sibyl, and plays the piano for her in the empty tavern. Sibyl is flattered by the attention of such a handsome gentleman, and her mother (Lydia Bilbrook) encourages the relationship because of Dorian\u0027s wealth, but Sibyl\u0027s brother James (Richard Fraser) is suspicious. James tells his enamored sister in private that if this young man, whom Sibyl nicknamed \"Sir Tristan\" after a virtuous knight in Arthurian mythology, ever harms her, he will kill him. James is then deployed to Australia on a sailing mission.Dorian excitedly tells Basil and Lord Henry that he is engaged to the beautiful Sibyl Vane, and invites them to come with him to the tavern to hear her sing. Despite having heard Lord Henry\u0027s disdainful views on marriage, Dorian is so genuinely happy that Lord Henry\u0027s words no longer influence him. Basil sees this as a positive development, and after seeing Sibyl perform and making her acquaintance, encourages the engagement for the sake of Dorian\u0027s moral purity. Lord Henry, on the other hand, cannot resist exploiting his innate ability to influence his friends, and suggests that Dorian test Sibyl\u0027s worth with an \"experiment.\" Dorian invites Sibyl to his house that night and, when she prepares to go home, asks her to stay. Torn between love and honor, Sibyl nearly leaves, but cannot resist Dorian\u0027s charm. This meant that she had failed Lord Henry\u0027s test, and Dorian sends her an incredibly hurtful letter, accusing her of \"killing his love,\" and that she can have no part in his life henceforth. He sends her a sum of money for compensation, but Sibyl is emotionally destroyed.When Dorian returns home after abandoning Sibyl, he notices a slight change in the portrait Basil had painted of him. The mouth looks somehow crueler, and a cold unkindness is present in the face that had not been there before. When he wakes the next morning, the change is still visible. He feels immense guilt over how badly he had treated Sibyl, and hastily composes an apology letter in an attempt to redeem himself. Before he can deliver it, Lord Henry arrives with the news that Sibyl Vane had killed herself the night before. Dorian is initially devastated, but Lord Henry convinces him to not blame himself for the tragedy and invites him to the opera. Abandoning his grief, Dorian falls deeper into Lord Henry\u0027s teachings of \"new hedonism\", and goes to the opera with him that very night. Basil is surprised and worried when he witnesses Dorian\u0027s uncaring behavior in regard to Sibyl\u0027s death, and Dorian plans to dedicate his life solely to his own pleasure. Because the change in the portrait still disturbed him, Dorian has it covered with a screen and locked in his old school room at the top of the house, to which he keeps the only key.Eighteen years later, Dorian is nearing his fortieth birthday, but has not visibly changed since age twenty-two. His friends and neighbors are awestruck at his youthful appearance, but unsavory rumors constantly circulate about his strange behavior and acquaintances. Having taken Lord Henry\u0027s ideas to heart, Dorian\u0027s life consists largely of scandals with women, opium dens, and influencing other wealthy young men to adopt his hedonistic way of living. Over time, many of his friends lost their good standing in society, and women were shamed to be in his company. Dorian meets Basil again, who is preparing to catch a train to Paris, and invites him to his house. Basil expresses his concern about Dorian\u0027s behavior, and admits that in order to truly know what kind of man Dorian is, he would have to see his soul itself. Dorian grimly leads Basil up to the old school room to look upon his handiwork for the first time in eighteen years. Dorian removes the coverings from the hidden portrait, and Basil is horrified to see that the man in the painting has warped into a hideous, demon-like creature to reflect Dorian\u0027s multitude of sins. Basil begs Dorian to repent and change his ways, but Dorian feels a surge of anger toward Basil, blaming him for his miserable life because the painting was his own work. Dorian stabs Basil to death and locks his body in the school room with the horrible painting, in which blood has appeared on the hands of the twisted painted Dorian.The next morning, Dorian summons a former friend, Allen Campbell (Douglas Walton), whose reputation had since been ruined by his associations with Dorian. Campbell is a scientist specializing in anatomy and chemistry, and Dorian blackmails the highly reluctant man into disposing of Basil\u0027s body. The nature of the blackmailing subject is not revealed, but Campbell agrees to disintegrate Basil\u0027s body, and departs afterward looking shaken and disturbed.Basil\u0027s disappearance is talked about in London society for some time, but Dorian is never suspected. Among the few who have remained his loyal friends are Lord Henry and Gladys (Donna Reed), Basil\u0027s niece, who was a little girl when the portrait was painted. Dorian enters a romance with Gladys, though he is apprehensive about the effect he appears to have on the lives of those he becomes close to. He visits a seedy inn one evening and finds a former friend, Adrian Singleton (Morton Lowry), a wealthy young man who had been ruined by following Dorian\u0027s influence. Adrian is now a disheveled opium addict, but he knows of Dorian\u0027s sordid past and mockingly addresses him as \"Sir Tristan\" as Dorian departs the inn. The nickname is overheard by James Vane, Sibyl\u0027s brother, who happened to be at the inn and had spent eighteen years being hell-bent on avenging his sister. Though he did not know her cruel suitor\u0027s name and had never seen his face, the name \"Sir Tristan\" is enough to motivate him to follow Dorian outside and threaten him. Dorian calmly denies ever knowing a Sibyl Vane, and asserts that he is too young to have had anything to do with a death that occurred eighteen years before. James Vane admits that this man looks too young to be the suspect, and releases him. Adrian Singleton, with both amusement and resentment, explains to James that Dorian Gray was the man he sought, and that he had not looked a day older than twenty-two for the past eighteen years. Enraged, James Vane begins to track down Dorian Gray.A few days later, Dorian attends a hunting party with several society friends. The sport is interrupted when a man, assumed to be a beater, is shot to death by accident after hiding in the bushes unseen. It is revealed to Dorian later that the dead man was not a beater, but James Vane, having followed Dorian in revenge and lost his own life in the process. Dorian feels even more guilty and cursed, but wishes to make one final stab at having a good and worthwhile life. He soon proposes marriage to Gladys, who happily accepts, much to the displeasure of her friend David Stone (Peter Lawford), who is one of the many who are suspicious of Dorian.Despite his happiness about his upcoming marriage to Gladys, Dorian is weighted down by the deaths of Sibyl, Basil, and James, as well as the ruin of Adrian Singleton and others like him. The last straw is the news that Allen Campbell, whom Dorian ruined and then blackmailed into disposing of Basil\u0027s body, had killed himself in misery. Dorian realizes that the one noble thing he can possibly do is to spare Gladys from the certain misfortune he will bring her.At long last, Dorian ventures up to the school room to face the painting that is the embodiment of his corrupted soul. Using the same knife with which he had murdered Basil Hallward, he stabs his painted figure through the heart. Dorian himself feels the effect of the knife, and collapses, praying for his salvation. Roused by his screams, his houseguests, including Gladys, David, and Lord Henry, rush upstairs and find Dorian Gray\u0027s dead body on the school room floor, now in the form of the hideous creature from the painting. The painting itself, with the knife still protruding from it, has reverted to its original image of the handsome, innocent youth than Dorian once was. Lord Henry, stricken, sees the horrible results of his own influence and gazes at Dorian\u0027s corpse in shocked remorse.","numvotes":"12975","primarytitle":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","productioncompany":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM)","countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"7.5","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","sex of artist":"male","storyline":"In 1886, in Victorian London, the corrupt Lord Henry Wotton (George Sanders) meets the pure Dorian Gray (Hurd Hatfield) posing for talented painter Basil Hallward (Lowell Gilmore).

The shot pans the upstairs floor where Margaret is crying out to God in agony. We see a puddle of water that has splattered a Bible and numerous droplets of blood. Margaret is writhing on the bed in agony thinking she has been afflicted with a cancer, and begs for God\u0027s mercy as she is taken. Her body contorts a few times as she screams and she looks up waiting to die. But she doesn\u0027t. She realizes she is still alive and there is something underneath her nightdress. She looks between her legs and finds a baby. She had been pregnant and didn\u0027t know it. Margaret nods. \"It\u0027s a test,\" she says, and reaches for scissors, ready to slay her newborn daughter. She almost stabs the baby, when something stops her at the last second. She puts the scissors down and cradles her newborn daughter.Cut to present day. Carrie White (Chloe Grace Moretz), now age 17 or 18, is a meek, shy young girl at her high school located in the small town of Castle Rock, Maine. Considered an outcast by everyone, she sneaks into the background hoping she will not be noticed. During P.E. class, during the gym game of water volleyball, the ball lands in front of her and she is asked to serve the ball. She accidentally hits Sue Snell (Gabriella Wilde) in the head which makes everyone, including Carrie, laugh. Sue\u0027s friend, Chris Hargensen (Portia Doubleday) tells Carrie, \"you eat shit\", so everyone starts laughing at her instead.After gym, Carrie starts to take a shower alone when she notices blood. She races to the girls for help, not understanding what is going on. The girls, led by Chris, realize Carrie is having her first period and doesn\u0027t understand it. Instead of helping, they throw tampons at her and chant: \"plug it up.\" Chris even films it on her iPhone. Even Sue joins in with the chanting and taunting, but stops halfway through, ashamed of what she is doing. The gym teacher, Ms. Desjardin (Judy Greer) overhears them and in an effort to calm her down, slaps Carrie to keep her from screaming. Ms. Desjardin yells for everyone to get out. As the girls file out, a light shatters. Sue looks at Carrie with deep regret and guilt.Carrie is taken to the principal\u0027s office with Ms. Desjardin as they try to explain what has happened (with the principal, Henry Grayle, severely uncomfortable with it). He tells Ms. Desjardin to handle the punishment of the girls that participated in the incident. The principal and Ms. Desjardin tell Carrie that they have called her mother to pick her up. Carrie goes completely white, begging them not to call her mom. Principal Grayle says they know the school has problems with her mother since the state disallowed her mother to home school Carrie, but Ms. Desjardin reassures her and says it will be okay. Carrie starts hyperventilating and a nearby water cooler shatters. Carrie leaves the office.Margaret comes to pick up Carrie. Nearby, Sue, Chris and her rough boyfriend Billy Nolan (Alex Russell) sit. Chris shows everyone the video of Carrie, who sees what Chris \u0026 the others are doing. Sue looks on at Carrie, and her face betrays more guilt.On the way home Carrie apologizes to her mother for making her come to school.When they get home, Carrie wants to talk to Margaret about why she didn\u0027t explain to her about her period. \"I thought I was dying,\" Carrie says. Margaret is evasive and tells her to come inside. Carrie tells her mother she won\u0027t; she wants to talk about what happened. As Carrie sits in the car, a local boy rides around it on his bicycle and calls her \"Crazy Carrie.\" Carrie apparently uses her powers to makes him fall off his bike, which scares him into fleeing.Inside the house, Carrie finds her mother banging her head on the wall. Carrie tells her to stop and just talk to her. Margaret, however, is more concerned with praying for forgiveness and creates her own bible verses on a whim to suit her needs. Carrie recognizes these \u0027verses\u0027 are not even real Bible verses and objects to her mother\u0027s prayers, but Margaret knocks her in the head with a bible. As their argument heads downstairs to the kitchen, Margaret calls her a sinner. \"I did not sin,\" Carrie says. Margaret opens the \"Prayer Closet\" and tells Carrie to get in. Carrie refuses so her mother throws her in and latches the door, telling her to pray for forgiveness. Carrie bangs on the door, begging to be let out. \"GOD, YOU SON OF A BITCH!\" Carrie screams, and then suddenly a crack is formed through the middle of the door to both their surprise. Carrie looks at a sculpture hanging on the wall of Jesus nailed to the cross. It begins to bleed to her horror.Meanwhile, Sue and her boyfriend, Tommy Ross (Ansel Elgort) are having sex in a jeep, though Sue\u0027s mind is somewhere else. They get dressed, and Sue talks about her guilt about what happened to Carrie and how she initially helped. Tommy relates he once beat a bully that had tormented him. He says the guy had it coming. \"What did Carrie White ever do you?\" Tommy asks.At the same time, Chris and Billy, along with another girlfriend, named Tina, hang out at her house. Chris is unrepentant about what she has done, and on a whim, decides to upload the video to YouTube, humiliating Carrie even further.Back at the White household, Margaret is making clothes and singing Bible songs. She eventually opens the closet and finds Carrie sleeping. She wakes her up and asks if she said her prayers. Carrie says yes, and Margaret becomes a loving mother again. They exchange \u0027I love you\"s.The next day, Ms. Desjardin lays down the law with Chris, Sue, and all the other girls that participated in Carries shaming. Ms. Desjardin asks about Chris and Sue\u0027s dates for the prom and tells Sue she would\u0027ve voted her Prom Queen but not anymore. Ms. Desjardin tells them it was a \"very shitty\" thing they did to Carrie and they are going to pay for it. She also mentions that apparently someone took a video of the incident, looking at Chris as she is pretty sure that she is the one who did it. They will be doing suicide sprints after school for a week. Anyone who refuses the punishment is suspended and cannot go to prom. \"While you run, I want you to think long and hard about what it would be like to be Carrie White,\" Ms. Desjardin says.After a while, Chris calls \"bullshit\" on the whole punishment, saying Ms. Desjardin can\u0027t do it. Sue tries to tell her to take the punishment and let it go but she won\u0027t. Chris refuses, so Ms. Desjardin suspends her and revokes her prom privileges. Chris says Ms. Desjardin can\u0027t take away prom from her and tries to rally the other girls to go with her. One by one, they refuse, including Sue, the only one who shows any true remorse. They continue to run while Chris screams: \"This is not over!\"Meanwhile, everyone snickers at Carrie, having seen the video. As Carrie walks down the hall, humiliated, she stares in disgust at graffiti that someone has sprayed across a bank of lockers saying, \u0027Carrie White eats shit\u0027. She goes in the bathroom and concentrates on the mirror. After a moment, she is able to smash it to her shock. Looking at the pieces she makes them levitate for a moment until another girl shows up. Carrie grabs her bag and leaves.Carrie goes to the library and looks to the web and numerous books about telekinesis. After seeing a video about telekinesis, she decides to test her own abilities with it in subtle ways. In class, Carrie looks at the flag outside the window, and makes it move. She smiles with a sense of accomplishment.Carrie is called to the front of the class and reads a favorite poem. It is quite dark, but well written and people pay attention to her. The teacher, Mr. Ullman, is amazed she has talked at all, and asked if she has something else to say after scaring the classroom. \"You asshole,\" Tommy mutters under his breath. The teacher asks what he said. Tommy said the poem was \"awesome\" and asks the teacher if he thought the same thing. Carrie looks at Tommy shyly and smiles.Meanwhile, Margaret is seen working at a dry cleaner/seamstress store. Someone calls out for help and it turns out to be Eleanor Snell, Sue\u0027s mother. She is picking up Sue\u0027s prom dress. Mrs. Snell tries to apologize for Sue\u0027s behavior and commends Margaret on the work she did. Meanwhile, Margaret is cutting herself on the leg with a needle, making herself bleed. \"These are godless times,\" Margaret says before returning to her work.Chris gets a meeting with Ms. Desjardin and Principal Grayle with her arrogant lawyer father to try and overturn her suspension and revoked prom privileges. Chris tries to play the victim, but Ms. Desjardin plays better hardball than her, saying there was a video uploaded and if Chris just proves it isn\u0027t on her phone, then she will get an apology and be allowed to go to prom. Her father tells her to give up the phone, but Chris refuses to and storms out, thus indirectly admitting her complicity and making sure her suspension and punishment stay active.Sue and the prom committee work on turning the gymnasium into the prom. Chris storms in, angrily telling her friends that she is banned from prom, and asks why the girls didn\u0027t back her up. She then asks why Sue didn\u0027t. Sue says because she deserved the punishment, they all did. Ms. Desjardin was right; they did a shitty thing to Carrie. Chris balks and says Carrie deserved it. \"What has Carrie White ever done to you?\" Sue asks her soon to be former friend. Chris tells Sue that she is not being high and mighty because she feels bad; it\u0027s because she wants to go to prom with Tommy then have sex with him in the hotel she already booked. \"You don\u0027t give a shit about Carrie White,\" Chris sneers, leaving.We see Sue at home, looking at her prom dress lovingly.Back at the White household, Carrie is in her room making books move, testing her powers. She eventually makes several levitate including her bed. Margaret hears the noise and takes a butcher knife to investigate. When she gets to Carrie\u0027s room, Carrie has fooled her, turning out the lights. Margaret puts the knife down and says she will never let anyone hurt her little girl. Carrie then accidentally causes the knife to stick into the floor, shocking Margaret.The next day, Sue watches Tommy play lacrosse. Sue comes up to Tommy and asks for a favor; she wants him to take Carrie to the prom. Tommy is shocked, saying he wants to take her, but Sue wants to do something to make up for the humiliation Carrie was put through. \"I\u0027m trying to fix what I did,\" she says. Tommy tries to convince her, but Sue says she can\u0027t go and begs him to help her make things right.Tommy finds Carrie at lunch and shocks her by talking to her. Tommy asks her about prom and if she would like to go with him. Carrie runs off without responding. Tommy tracks her down and asks again, but Carrie thinks it is a joke. \"Stop trying to trick me,\" Carrie says. \"I\u0027m not,\" Tommy replies. Carrie doesn\u0027t believe him however, and runs off.Carrie is crying in the locker room and is discovered by Ms. Desjardin. Ms. Desjardin thinks the girls did something again but Carrie says she got invited to prom. Ms. Desjardin says that\u0027s a happy thing and asks who asked her. Carrie says Tommy Ross. Ms. Desjardin, realizing something is up, stays neutral saying he is a cute boy. Carrie says she knows he dates Sue Snell and thinks this a big joke to him. \"They\u0027re going to trick me again,\" Carrie says. Ms. Desjardin says maybe not. Carrie ponders why Tommy would want to go with her. Ms. Desjardin directs Carrie to the mirror telling her she sees a beautiful girl and with the right dress and the tiniest dash of makeup she can stun everyone speechless.Ms. Desjardin confronts Sue and Tommy thinking they are planning something. \"If the two of you are planning some kind of joke on a poor, lonely, defenseless girl...\" Ms. Desjardin warns them. However, Sue says she is trying to do a good thing for Carrie; allow her one good night and a chance to be social. Tommy says it doesn\u0027t matter since Carrie said no, but Sue tells him to try again. Ms. Desjardin tries to appeal to Tommy saying he will look \u0027ridiculous\u0027 with Carrie on his arm, but Sue says this is a private matter and they don\u0027t care how they look doing it.Tommy drives over to Carrie\u0027s house and tells her he is not leaving till she says yes to prom. Fearful her mother will see them, Carrie says yes but that she will have to be home by 10:30 pm. Tommy says he will pick her up at 7:00 pm. Carrie smiles.Carrie goes into town and sees a dress shop. She looks at one in the store front and her body reflected onto it. Going inside, she sees that they are too pricey for what she can afford. She sees some fabric and stares at awe at the potential. From across the street, Chris and her friends see Carrie at the store and Chris seethes in rage. It is at this time that Chris begins to plot revenge against Carrie for what Chris sees as getting her banned from prom, and apparently enlists the help of her friends Tina, twins Nicki \u0026 Lizzy, and Heather.That evening, Carrie walks home seeing her mom waiting for her in the front yard. Margaret is livid since she didn\u0027t know where she was. Carrie says she went into town to buy fabric to make herself a gown. Margaret says she is not allowed to go anywhere but school and home. Carrie then tells her the news; she\u0027s been asked to prom. Carrie tells her that she knows she is scared and she is too. However, the kids laugh at her and think she is weird. She doesn\u0027t want to be weird; she wants to be normal and thinks prom may be her final chance. \"I have to try and be a whole person before it is too late,\" Carrie says. Margaret is livid and tells her to go to her closet and repent before it is too late. Carrie asks why she can\u0027t be happy for her. But the insane Margaret refuses to listen and orders Carrie to go to her closet. Carrie then has an episode and makes everything in the living room jump up. Margaret falls to the floor in shock and starts to pray. Carrie tells her mom to get up and when she doesn\u0027t, she raises her with her powers. Margaret calls Carrie a devil, but Carrie says she has powers and others have them too. Carrie states that her grandmother may have had them and it\u0027s possible that they skipped a generation to Carrie. Carrie places her mother down and her mother says she thought she was a cancer when she was born. Carrie tells her that is a horrible thing to say and levitates her again. She tells her she is going to prom, she will not stop her, and they are not talking about it anymore. Carrie then releases her.Meanwhile, Chris, Billy and a few others are at a pig farm. Billy callously crushes a pig\u0027s head and Chris slits the throat to collect the blood.The next day, Sue is working on the prom decorations when she feels sick. She runs to the bathroom and throws up. Shock hits her face; she thinks she is pregnant.We see Carrie make her prom dress. Chris and Billy break into the gymnasium and rig the pail with the pig blood. Billy tells Chris she can drop it on Carrie, and Chris states she has every intention of doing so.Sue puts her dress away, committing to her decision.We see a montage of the students get ready and dressed for prom. We see Carrie put her dress on and apply some light makeup. She has fully transformed herself into the beautiful woman she was meant to be.Margaret tells her she looks like a deviant. Carrie, having enough of her mother\u0027s overly religious quotes, asks that for once that her mom could be happy for her. Margaret says they are going to laugh at her, but Carrie says to stop it. Tommy is a nice boy and everything is going to be fine. As Tommy shows up, Margaret tells her daughter that she was conceived by what was basically marital rape and how she tried to kill her as a baby. Carrie, finally losing all her patience, force-chokes her mom. \"There will be a judgment Carrie\", Margaret says. Carrie opens the closet and locks her mother in with her powers, saying she will be back at 10:30 pm as promised. She then melts the door lock so her mother can\u0027t get out.Carrie goes outside to meet Tommy. \"Do I look okay?\" Carrie asks. \"You look beautiful,\" Tommy says, meaning it.They drive to prom in a limo. Carrie requests a moment, thinking about the other students. Tommy tells her despite what she thinks they aren\u0027t all bad. Calming her down, they go in, where she is introduced to Tommy\u0027s best friend and his girlfriend, who goes to another school. The other girl compliments Carrie on her dress, and is pleasantly surprised to find out that Carrie made it herself.Carrie begins to loosen up. Tommy asks if she wants to dance but they agree to wait till a slow one comes on, after Carrie sees some wild dance moves from another student and isn\u0027t sure what to make of them. Ms. Desjardin sees Carrie and tells her how beautiful she looks. While they talk, Tommy texts Sue, telling her that everything is okay, Carrie is enjoying herself and that he misses her. Sue smiles, content that she is making it right.A slow song comes on and Tommy convinces Carrie to dance with him. He teaches her how to slow dance and she quickly learns. Carrie puts her head on his shoulder then backs away. Something crosses Tommy\u0027s face when that happens; while he is still obviously loyal to Sue, he is starting to grow some feelings for Carrie due to her being such a sweet person. Carrie, still unsure about his intentions asks why he asked her to prom. Tommy says that he wanted to, and is having a good time with her and hopes she is feeling the same way. Carrie nods yes. Tommy then says they will enjoy their time here then they can go to an after party and he will have back home on time. Carrie smiles, agrees, and notes that she can maybe stay out till 11.Thanks to Chris\u0027s friend Tina, Billy and Chris break into the prom and sit in the rafters waiting. They hand off ballots to Tina\u0027s date, Greg Delois, who switches them out to rig the Prom King and Queen election to ensure Carrie \u0026 Tommy are elected.The voting for Prom King and Queen begins. Carrie questions voting for herself but Tommy tells her there isn\u0027t much to it, and she should have one chance to be in the spotlight. Carrie notes that the crowns are beautiful. \"The Devil with false modesty,\" Tommy says. Carrie is convinced so they vote for themselves. Meanwhile, Chris\u0027s friends switch out the ballots to rig them in Tommy and Carrie\u0027s favor.Chris texts on her cell phone to Sue while Sue is getting out of the shower. She says \"Your girl looks good. She won\u0027t for long.\" Horror washes over Sue\u0027s face; she knew Chris was vindictive but not to this extent. Sue realizes that Chris has planned something horrifying to humiliate Carrie, and races to prom to try to stop her.Chris seems to have second thoughts for a moment. Billy reminds her that what they are doing is criminal assault, and they need to flee the second they are done.Meanwhile, Sue gets to the building but can\u0027t get in. She sees someone open the door and sneaks in.The \"ballots\" are counted. Tommy and Carrie win. Carrie is stunned but happy. They walk up to the podium with everyone applauding. Ms. Desjardin, Mr. Ullman, and Principal Grayle are especially happy for Carrie, glad to see that she has finally got her moment in the sun.Sue looks around and sees Chris in the rafters. Chris sees Sue looking at her. She hesitates momentarily, but Billy goads her on to pull the rope. Ms. Desjardin sees Sue and misconstrues her reasons for being there and throws her out of the building without hearing her warning.Chris pulls the rope. Although the rope jams and forces Chris to pull on it several times, it eventually gives way and the pig blood cascades down and drowns Carrie in it. Complete and utter silence follows. \"WHAT THE HELL?!\" Tommy yells at everyone, having and wanting no part in this unbelievable act of cruelty. Chris has hacked the video monitors, and using her iPhone, plays Carrie\u0027s period video. Most of the class laughs, but Ms. Desjardin, along with a few others, are in complete shock. Ms. Desjardin goes to Carrie but Carrie pushes her back with her powers, startling everyone.Chris and Billy rig the rope and begin to flee but Chris wants to stick around and see Carrie squirm. The rope, however, gives way and the pail that held the blood cracks Tommy on the back of the head, killing him instantly. Carrie turns back around and cradles his head in her lap, absolutely devastated that the only boy that ever treated her kindly has been killed. Carrie looks up in the rafters and recognizes Billy\u0027s sunglasses. She knows who is responsible. Something snaps in her mind. She turns to the guests, as the blood on her body starts to levitate off it. A few see this and try to flee in horror but it is no use.Carrie finally loses control and violently force-pushes the entire crowd back, people hitting tables and each other. She then slams all the doors of the gym shut and locks them, so no one can get out. One of the girls, Heather, is force-thrown across the room and has her head smashed into a closed door. Tina\u0027s date, Greg Delois, and a few other guys try to escape by climbing the bleachers, but Carrie collapses them, gorily crushing Greg to death. As a boy films her, she throws a table at him, the force of the hit killing him. Carrie then trips the sprinklers leaving the whole room soaked in water. As she sees the twin girls Nicki and Lizzy, friends of Chris, trying to flee, she forces-pushes them to the ground where they are trampled to death by the fleeing mob. Behind Carrie on the stage, a light fixture drops from the ceiling, touching off a fire on the stage and exposing several live electrical cables. Seeing Chris\u0027s friend Tina attempting to escape, Carrie force-throws a burning decoration at her but misses. Carrie then uses the live electrical cables to torture Tina, driving her back towards a smaller fire burning on the floor. The hem of the dress comes in contact with the fire, and in seconds the flames have engulfed the dress, causing Tina to burn to death. As flames envelop the room, Ms. Desjardin tries to calm Carrie down but Carrie grabs her in a Darth Vader-like force-choke hold and pulls her up, holding her for a moment above the floor that has become electrified as the electrical cables come in contact with the water from the sprinklers. However, her reasoning returns momentarily and she spares Ms. Desjardin, pulling her across to the stage, as she was one of the few people that were ever nice to her. Carrie then levitates herself out of the building as Ms. Desjardin and the few remaining students watch in horror and shock.By now the entire school is in flames. While people some escape, many don\u0027t. Carrie sees Chris and Billy\u0027s red car. Her rage returns.Chris asks Billy what they should do as their little prank is now responsible for at least a dozen deaths. Billy tells her they will leave town and never come back. Chris agrees reluctantly. As they drive off, Carrie is behind them. She stomps the ground and causes it to cave out ahead. Billy turns the car around and speeds back. Chris sees Carrie and despite everything, will not give up her vendetta. \"RUN HER DOWN. KILL HER!\" Chris snarls. Billy says he has it under control and charges Carrie. Carrie however is waiting for him and stops the car with her power, the force causing Billy to hit the steering wheel hard, breaking his nose, and causing his head to violently snap back and kill him instantly. Chris comes to a few minutes later, and realizes Billy is dead from the impact. She cries but when she sees Carrie, she reaches for the keys and backs up, still hell-bent on killing her. When she charges again, Carrie pulls the car\u0027s back wheels up high in the air, and then throws the vehicle into a gas station pump. The force of the throw causes Chris\u0027s face to go through the windshield making shards of glass embed all around her face. Carrie watches as Chris breathes her last breath. As an extra precaution and because Chris deserved it, Carrie causes a power pole to spark and collapse, igniting the leaking gasoline and causing an explosion that guarantees Billy\u0027s and Chris\u0027s deaths.Back at the burned gym, Sue sees Ms. Desjardin and they both sob at the destruction.Carrie begins to walk home, destroying everything in her path. When she gets inside, she sees her mom had forced a hole from the crack in the door and has escaped from the closet. Carrie calls out to her but gets no response. Her mother is hiding in the shadows.Carrie gets into the bathtub and cleans off all the blood, changing into a blue nightgown. She finds Margaret and tells her she was right about everything. They hug and Margaret suggests they pray. As they pray, Margaret takes her butcher knife and stabs Carrie once in the back. Carrie then pushes her mother back as she falls down the stairs. Their fight continues in the kitchen as Carrie begs her mother to stop what she is doing. \"You know a devil never dies. You gotta keep killing it,\" Margaret says, manic. They struggle and she slices Carrie on the leg and arm. When she tries to stab Carrie in the face, Carrie stops the blade with her powers and then pulls up numerous sharp objects and points them in her mother\u0027s direction. Telling her she is sorry, Carrie lets them fly, and they impale her mother to the wall as if in a crucifix-like pose.Carrie, horrified by what she is done, releases the blades that pin her mother to the wall. Margaret dies moments later in Carrie\u0027s lap. Carrie cries at the loss.Moments later, Sue arrives at the house. Carrie is angry with her saying she just killed her mother and she wants her back. \"Why couldn\u0027t you leave me alone?\" Carrie asks. Sue says she tried to help her. Carrie puts Sue in a force choke-hold as the house begins to collapse around them due to her powers becoming uncontrollable. \"Don\u0027t hurt me Carrie,\" Sue pleads. \"Why not?\" Carrie snarls. Then, Carrie puts Sue down. Sue tries to reach for Carrie so they can escape. Carrie places her hand near Sue\u0027s stomach. \"It\u0027s a girl,\" Carrie says. Sue looks at her in shock. \"You don\u0027t know?\" Carrie asks. Carrie pushes her out of the house. Sue watches as rocks come out of nowhere and fall directly on the house, collapsing it on itself. Carrie holds her mother and kisses her forehead as the house finally falls down on the both of them. Sue looks on in horror and gingerly touches her stomach.An undisclosed time later, Sue is giving a deposition in front of the whole town (as to her pregnancy subplot, it is very unclear whether Sue is still pregnant or not and/or she kept the baby). The man interviewing her asks if what she saw happen could\u0027ve been a natural accident. Sue however, stands by her story. Carrie was just a normal girl with normal hopes and desires like everyone else, and they pushed her and when people get pushed, eventually they break. They broke Carrie White.We see Sue at the graveyard where Margaret and Carrie are at a joint plot. Someone has spray painted \"CARRIE WHITE IS IN HELL\" on the gravestone with an arrow pointing down. Even in death, someone still had to be heartless to the poor, lonely girl who only wanted to be accepted. Sue lays a white rose at the grave and leaves. A moment later a force comes up from the ground, cracking the tombstone down the middle. In the middle, a crater forms in the shape of a heart. Carrie\u0027s ultimate fate is left ambiguous.","numvotes":"138581","primarytitle":"Carrie"},"color":"rgb(92,73,83)","size":1.0},{"source":"comes to life","target":"tt3263000","id":"6709","attributes":{"productioncompany":"Chaiyo Productions","countriesoforigin":"Thailand","averagerating":"5.5","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"King-ka kay-a-sit","storyline":"The Magic Lizard is skating with his friends around Bangkok.

After her sister gives her her mother\u0027s car, Nell orders her sister, brother-in-law, and nephew to leave. Once she\u0027s alone she finds an ad in the local newspaper asking for volunteers to take part in a study on insomnia at an old New England mansion, which Nell decides to join. Elsewhere we find Dr. Marrow (Liam Neeson) discussing with his assistant Mary over which volunteers he should use for his study, which he explains is actually an experiment on how people react to fear. Once Nell arrives at Hill House, she argues politely with Mr. Dudley the caretaker to let her in. After minutes of arguing she finally enters through the gates of Hill House where at the door she finds Mr. Dudley\u0027s wife Mrs. Dudley. As Nell makes her way to her room, it\u0027s clear that she\u0027s instantly drawn to the house. Moments later Theo (Catherine Zeta-Jones) arrives and gives Nell with an awkward homophobic reaction. After the two get to know each other a little better, they both go downstairs and explore, and find the carousel room, then they return to the main entrance and meet Luke (Owen Wilson) Dr. Marrow, and his two assistants Mary and Todd. Once they get to dinner they discuss insomnia issues and find out more about each other, and learn what they\u0027d be doing for the next few days. After dinner, Dr. Marrow leads his guests to a room to tell everyone the story of Hill House and how Hugh Crain had built it for his wife and wished desperately for children, which all died at birth. After Dr. Marrow tells the story his assistant Mary talks about how she can feel the evil everywhere and that there\u0027s more to the story. As she goes up to examine the piano one of the strings snaps and cuts her, causing her and Todd to leave for the remainder of the movie. As everyone gets ready for bed Dr. Marrow tells Luke about how Hugh Crain\u0027s wife had killed herself, in order to scare Luke. Once upstairs Luke occupies himself with a book and a candy dispenser, while Theo tries to get closer to Nell, and Nell reluctantly asks to go to bed. As Nell and Theo are in bed, Luke decides to wander around, and is met be Dr. Marrow, who decides to talk for a while. As everything calms down for the night Nell is startled by a screaming Theo, in response to a constant mysterious banging on the walls. Nell and Theo cower as Luke rushes to see what the screaming is, although he was unaware of any banging. The next morning everyone tries to talk things out, but Dr. Marrow assures everyone the coldness and noises were all due to the old plumbing. The next night as Nell is asleep the movie encounters it\u0027s first visual samples of paranormal activity, and Nell is encountered by ghostly figures taking forms through the bed sheets and curtains. As Nell and Luke are filling out papers for Dr. Marrows research, Luke confides in Nell that Dr. Marrow must be up to something and that he would get to the bottom of things. Luke soon wanders off talking about Theo leaving Nell alone, where she experiences more paranormal events. Everyone quickly rushes in to see what was wrong and finds Nell scared, and concerned over what was happening in the house. While Dr. Marrow and Luke looked around to see what might have startled Eleanor look comes to a frightening observation that the large portrait of Hugh Crain had been vandalized with blood reading, \"Welcome Home Eleanor.\" Eleanor is appalled at the writing and demands to know who did it, but no one confesses, leaving tension between the characters. The group soon makes their way to the green room where they find a large unstable spiral staircase, and a fountain containing a large statue of Hugh Craine, and some more statues of a women surrounded by 6 children. As another night comes we find Nell sleeping, but she is soon awakened by some more sounds. As she looks around she finds a trail of bloody foot prints leading her to a hidden library. In the library she finds logs of hundreds of children that Hugh Craine must have taken in to his house, finding that many of them had actually died working for Hugh Crain. She goes to tell Theo, but Theo doesn\u0027t believe what Nell tells her, and goes back to bed.  Once Eleanor is alone she starts to brush her hair, but when she stops her hair parts on it\u0027s own, and Eleanor is deeply frightened once more. The next morning Nell finds Dr. Marrow\u0027s studies, and learns what the experiment actually is. She also finds out that he\u0027s interpreting her behavior as delusional. In the statue garden Luke talks to Theo and seems to have also figured out what Dr. Marrow was doing, but when they encounter Nell, she expresses that it\u0027s not Dr. Marrow doing everything to the house, and that it\u0027s indeed ghosts. She then insists that home is where the heart is. When Nell looks up she sees Hugh Crain\u0027s wife hanging, but no one else sees it leading everyone to think even more that Eleanor is mentally unstable and should go home. Nell rushes to the library and finds pictures of Hugh Crain\u0027s wife whispering for her to check the fire place. In the fire place Nell finds a skeleton that comes to life causing Nell to run away, following the voices of children. She tries to go through a door but is punched by a hand that formed from the door and soon disappeared. Eleanor rushes to the rest of the group and concludes that Hugh Crain took children from the town to work at the mills then never let them go. As she tells this to Theo, Luke, and Dr. Marrow, they conclude that she\u0027s going crazy from emotional distress and fear.  As Theo tries talking to Dr. Marrow about her, she finds that they\u0027re in an experiment to study reactions to fear, and becomes furious at what the experiment had done to Nell. Once Nell\u0027s in bed and Theo finishes comforting her and leaves to bring her tea, the walls form the shape of a face, and everything starts falling apart around her. She runs out and looks in the mirror to see Mrs. Crain\u0027s face, and then runs away again to the carousel room. She\u0027s then extremely frightened and runs to the green room. Theo, Luke, and Dr. Marrow go searching for Nell and finally come to the green room to find Nell climbing the spiral stair case. Dr. Marrow goes to save her, but the stairway starts to unhinge, causing Dr. Marrow to desperately and quickly bring Nell to safety. Dr. Marrow goes to the green room to examine and take notes, and is grabbed by the statue of Hugh Crain, which them starts to fountain out blood. He runs to Theo and Luke, to go check on Eleanor.

An Egyptian archaeology expedition finds an ancient badge in the sand. Archaeologists Stephen Banning [Felix Aylmer] and Joseph Whemple [Raymond Huntley] take it to show to Stephen\u0027s son John [Peter Cushing] who is resting in a nearby tent because he has a broken leg. They believe the badge indicates they are close to finding the concealed tomb of Princess Ananka on the basis that the badge may have come from one of her soldiers. Despite their excitement they are also concerned about the implications of John\u0027s leg having not been treated and therefore not healing properly. At the entrance to the tomb, they are stopped by an Egyptian man Mehemet Bey [George Pastell] who implores them not to open the tomb for fear of the consequences but Stephen and Joseph ignore him and enter. Inside they find the sarcophagus of the Princess. Joseph goes back outside to tell John of their discovery. Stephen remains inside and finds a scroll of life but as he picks it up a door in the wall of the tomb opens behind him. Outside, Joseph and John hear Stephen scream and Joseph re-enters the tomb to find Stephen comatose.Several months later and Joseph and John are removing the last of the relics from the tomb. They discuss Stephen, who has been in a mental hospital ever since and may never be cured. After everything has been removed, one of their Egyptian servants re-seals the tomb with explosives. Nearby, Mehemet Bey offers a prayer for vengeance against those who have desecrated the tomb. He has the scroll of life with him.England 1898. After three years at the mental hospital, Stephen has improved and John goes to visit him. Stephen does not remember John\u0027s broken leg but he remembers that when he read the scroll of life in Princess Ananka\u0027s tomb, he brought a mummy back to life and he becomes agitated. John does not believe him but Stephen warns him that someone has the scroll and the mummy will be released again.Two drunk men leave a nearby pub to transport a wooden crate on their horse and cart. At the nursing home, Stephen becomes agitated about the mummy again and smashes the window just as the horse and cart pass. The crate on the cart starts bouncing about so the men panic and increase their speed, but the crate becomes loose and falls off the cart into a watery bog. The police and men search for the crate but are unable to find it. Mehemet Bey appears and tells the police the men were transporting the crate to him at a nearby large house and that it contained ancient relics.At the nursing home, the doctor [Willoughby Gray] explains to John that Stephen has had to be restrained but they do not really understand the reasons for his agitation.At the bog, Mehemet Bey reads the scroll of life to resurrect the mummy [Christopher Lee]. Bey instructs the mummy to seek out those who desecrated the tomb and take vengeance against them. The mummy goes to the mental hospital, breaks through the bars of the window to Stephen\u0027s room and strangles him.At the subsequent inquest the conclusion is forced entry and murder by person or persons unknown. Joseph and John return home to look through Stephen\u0027s papers in an attempt to discover who may have wished Stephen harm. They discuss the discovery of Princess Ananka\u0027s tomb and the point when Stephen lost his mind. John reads the story of Princess Ananka\u0027s death from illness on a pilgrimage.In a flashback the body of Princess Ananka [Yvonne Furneaux] is anointed in a ceremony overseen by her high priest Kharis [Christopher Lee]. Her body is taken in a long procession by Kharis to be entombed along with various symbolic relics and statues. Her body is laid to rest in a tomb in the side of a mountain a thousand miles from her home. In various ceremonies over the following days slaves and maidens are sacrificed to ensure the location of the tomb remains a secret. Finally Kharis returns to the tomb alone with the scroll of life. He had secretly been in love with Ananka, which was forbidden for a priest, and tries to bring her back to life by reading the scroll. However, he is caught in the act and sentenced to have his tongue cut out and to remain on guard for eternity at the tomb. He is wrapped in bandages and buried alive in a secret chamber next to Ananka in the tomb.Joseph and John think that Stephen possibly lost his mind over the myths in the story of Ananka and Kharis.At his house Bey offer a prayer to his Egyptian god and instructs the mummy of Kharis to destroy the second of the tomb\u0027s desecrators. As the mummy walks through the woods it is seen by a poacher [Michael Ripper] who flees to a nearby pub. The mummy bursts through the door of Joseph and John\u0027s house and strangles Joseph. John is unable to stop the mummy so runs to get a gun. He fires several shots, hitting the mummy a few times as it leaves but to no effect.Inspector Mulrooney [Eddie Byrne] arrives at the house and John explains that he believes it was a mummy that murdered Joseph, because of Stephen and Joseph\u0027s discovery of Princess Ananka\u0027s tomb. In a flashback, Stephen is shown reading the scroll of life in the tomb and the mummified Kharis coming back to life. As Stephen screams, Bey enters the tomb and orders the mummy back into its burial chamber. Bey leaves with the scroll. Mulrooney does not believe John\u0027s story about the mummy killing Joseph, saying he wants facts. John warns Mulrooney that he may be next to be killed.At the police station, the poacher is brought in and describes to Mulrooney the figure he saw in the woods. Mulrooney also interviews one of the men who transported the crate, and the policeman who searched for the crate in the bog and spoke to Bey.Bey offers another prayer to his god and instructs the mummy to destroy the last of the tomb\u0027s desecrators.At his home John notices that his wife Isobel [Yvonne Furneaux] bears a striking resemblance to a picture of Princess Ananka. John mentions his fears about being attacked by the mummy to Isobel and asks her to remain upstairs where she will be safe. John gets a shotgun ready as the mummy makes its way towards his house. The mummy breaks in through the windows and John shoots it but to no avail. He then impales the mummy with a spear but the mummy still attacks and starts to strangle him. Isobel runs downstairs and when the mummy sees her he stops strangling John. The mummy approaches Isobel calmly because of her resemblance to Princess Ananka, then leaves the house quietly.Mulrooney returns to the house now believing John\u0027s story and asks John about the Egyptian man living in the house near the nursing home. After Mulrooney leaves, John heads towards Bey\u0027s house. Inside the house Bey believes the mummy has killed all three desecrators and orders the mummy to rest before they return home. John arrives at Bey\u0027s house and they exchange courtesies. Bey wonders why archaeologists like John desecrate Egyptian tombs which were meant to be sealed for all time and John explains it is so they can understand history and civilisation. John expresses his opinion that the ancient Egyptians lacked intelligence because they believed in a worthless god and sacrificed people violently. Bey disagrees as it is part of Egyptian culture and suggests John should be punished for his views. John apologises and in the process of leaving notices Bey has the seal to Ananka\u0027s tomb on a table. Bey returns to pray to his god to apologise for his failure and promises that he will ensure the last desecrator will be dead before sunrise.John returns home and he, Isobel and Mulrooney prepare for the arrival of the mummy with loaded guns. Isobel and Mulrooney and a policeman hide in the woods around the house. Bey and the mummy approach through the woods and attack first the poacher, then the policeman, then knock Mulrooney unconscious before entering the house. The mummy attacks John and he fires twice before the mummy starts to strangle him. Isobel runs in and tells the mummy to stop. At first the mummy ignores her, until John instructs her to let her hair down so she more closely resembles Princess Ananka. Bey orders the mummy to kill her but when it refuses he tries to stab her himself. The mummy attacks Bey and Isobel faints. The mummy picks up Isobel and carries her to the bog followed by John, Mulrooney and several men. John calls to Isobel to wake her up and she instructs the mummy to put her down. Once she is free the men open fire and the mummy sinks into the bog water clutching the scroll of life.","numvotes":"9410","primarytitle":"The Mummy"},"color":"rgb(102,84,106)","size":1.0},{"source":"body in art","target":"tt0818139","id":"6909","attributes":{"notes":"Adaptation","runtimeminutes":"5","sex of killer":"female","numvotes":"6","primarytitle":"Tell-Tale Art","productioncompany":"Noble Savage Productions","countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"4.0","titletype":"short","originaltitle":"Tell-Tale Art","sex of artist":"female","storyline":"A successful artist named Lenore brutally murders her husband, dismembers his body with a hacksaw, and conceals the pieces within a grotesque sculpture masquerading as modern art.

It is Hans\u0027 intention to collect information about the Mill of the Stone   Women, as it is known to the locals, and about the current owner,   professor and sculptor Gregorius Wahl [Robert Boehme], whose great grandfather created the   windmill and its eerie stone sculptures one hundred years ago. While   waiting for the housekeeper to summon the professor, Hans notices a   beautiful but sad-faced woman looking at him from behind a curtain. Before   he can say or do anything, he is directed by the housekeeper to wait in   the Professor\u0027s study. The housekeeper locks Hans in the study, but he   cannot miss the wails coming from behind the curtains. Alone in the study,   Hans has a chance to see the many stone sculptures in various stages of   preparation. He also comes upon a drawing of the young woman he just saw   behind the curtain. It is signed \"Elfi, 1912.\"Suddenly, a grinding sound in the next room attracts Hans\u0027 attention.   Curtains open to reveal a moving carousel featuring a diorama of women   from history. A sculpture of Joan of Arc tied to a stake passes by,   followed by Cleopatra holding an asp. Just as suddenly as it began, the   carousel stops as the professor enters the room. He seems a bit taken   aback that Hans has arrived earlier than expected but gives him a pile of   documents and a room on the second floor where he can work in peace. He   also warns Hans that he must complete his studies in six days.The next day, while Hans works hard on his research, his friends   Liselotte [Dany Carrel] and Raab [Marco Guglielmi], both students at the Academy of Fine Arts where Wahl   teaches drawing and sculpture, are discussing how Hans showing up is   causing Liselotte to feel distracted, as she and Hans were childhood   friends. Raab is distracted himself...by the girl posing as today\u0027s model.   Unfortunately, Annelore [Liana Orfei] has just taken a job as a singer in Paris, so   there is no hope for Raab. Later that evening, Hans meets Raab and   Liselotte at a nearby tavern. Liselotte is hoping to rekindle something   with Hans, until Hans asks Raab about the professor\u0027s daughter, Elfi.   Liselotte can see the interest in Hans\u0027 eyes and walks away.The next day, Elfi [Scilla Gabel] comes to see Hans. She begs him to help her and   gives him a key to her bedroom with instructions to meet her there at 11   PM. At 10:30, Elfi calls it a day and goes up to bed. She is accompanied   by her doctor, Loren Bolem [Wolfgang Preiss], who compliments her on her passionate   piano-playing and wishes she felt such passion for him, but Elfi wants   nothing to do with the doctor, even when he reminds her that he\u0027s the only   one who knows her secret. At 11, Hans enters Elfi\u0027s bedroom as planned,   only to find her sleeping soundly, almost as though in death. When he   arouses her, Elfi confesses that she was dreaming of him, and she offers   herself to Hans right then and there. Hans doesn\u0027t resist.On Sunday, there is a scheduled public showing of the carousel. As   the villagers arrive, Hans is informed that he has two visitors, too. It   is Raab and Liselotte. While Raab watches the performance, Hans and   Liselotte hang back in order to express their love for each other.   Unbeknown to Hans, Elfi is standing on the balcony and overhears   everything. Elfi leaves a note on Hans\u0027 desk that says \"I must see you   tonight without fail. No one will be here. You must explain everything,   otherwise...\" When Liselotte faints at the sight of the macabre carousel,   Raab takes her home. The professor calls Hans to his office and tries to   warn him about his daughter\u0027s delicate medical condition. She must not be   subjected to any strong emotions or her life could be in danger. The   warning is pretty clear...Hans is not to mess with Elfi.That night, Hans meets Elfi as she requested. Elfi swears her love   for Hans but is devastated when he tells her that he doesn\u0027t love her and   that their night together was a mistake. She begs him to take her away   with him, but Hans refuses. Elfi grabs a knife and threatens to kill him,   but Hans turns away and heads for the door. Suddenly, Elfi gasps for a   breath and falls to the floor. Not knowing what to do, Hans carries Elfi   to her bedroom and lays her atop her bed. Hans notices a mirror on her bed   and holds it in front of her face. When he sees no condensation on the   mirror, he backs away in horror. Elfi is dead! Hans runs away.Some days later, Hans returns to the mill to confess all to the   professor. Wahl is extremely angry and holds Hans responsible for Elfi\u0027s   murder. He informs Hans that Elfi has already been buried in the Veeze   cemetery, but Hans is confused when he finds a fresh rose on his desk. Who   could have put it there if Elfi is dead? Seeing the state that Hans is in,   Dr Bolem gives him two tranquilizers that cause Hans to pass out. He   awakens to a dream (or hallucination?) of Elfi rising from her bed. He   hears the piano playing, but the door into the parlor is locked. He roams   the mill, sees Elfi laid out in her coffin, hears screams and sees a girl   tied to a chair. Hans is finally confronted by Dr Bolem and Professor   Wahl, who cannot understand what Hans is going on about. Suddenly, Elfi   comes down the stairs, having been awaken by all the shouting. Hans is   speechless, and Wahl arranges for him to be taken by carriage back to town.Now the truth comes out. Bolem and Wahl are trying to confuse Hans,   to make him believe he\u0027s had an episode of madness. Unfortunately, all the   excitement causes Elfi to have another attack. While the doctor prepares   Elfi, the professor fetches the tied up girl (Annelore). The \"treatment\"   involves drawing off all of Elfi\u0027s \"bad blood\" and replacing it with blood   from Annelore along with a special serum developed by Bolem. As Elfi   revives, Annelore dies. Meanwhile, Hans is being taken care of by Raab and   Liselotte. His doctor believes Hans has suffered a nervous breakdown. Hans   is already feeling better and tells Liselotte that he\u0027s going to go to   Danzen, their home town, in order to ask Liselotte\u0027s parents for   permission to marry her.Back at the mill, Wahl is mummifying Annelore\u0027s body in preparation   for creating another statue for his macabre carousel. Bolem is performing   some tests on a sample of blood taken from Liselotte on the day she   fainted at the mill. Liselotte\u0027s blood type proves to be an exact match to   Elfi\u0027s, he tells Wahl, and transfusing Liselotte\u0027s blood into Elfi will   result in a total cure for Elfi\u0027s condition. Wahl can\u0027t wait and readies   the laboratory so that the transfusion can be performed as soon as   possible.When Hans returns from Danzen, he learns from the landlord that   Liselotte has been missing for the past 24 hours. In her room, Hans finds   her purse with her money and papers still in it. On her dresser, he sees a   photo of Liselotte with Annelore and recognizes Annelore as the girl he   saw tied to a chair at the mill. It wasn\u0027t a dream. It wasn\u0027t an   hallucination. It really happened. Looking for proof before going back to   the mill, Hans and Raab visit Elfi\u0027s grave and find it empty. Near the   tomb is a wax dummy of Elfi. Now certain that Hans wasn\u0027t dreaming,   hallucinating, or nuts, they break into the mill.The transfusion is underway in the basement laboratory. Liselotte is   ready, and they only have to anesthetize Elfi. A storm is brewing, and the   strong winds set the arms of the windmill turning. A new sculpture has   been added to the carousel, but the head falls off as the figure passes   before Hans and Raab. Raab picks up the head and recognizes it as the   mummified head of Annelore. Suddenly, a scream pierces the air. As Raab   and Hans struggle to get into the basement, Bolem confronts Wahl with a   request for Elfi\u0027s hand in marriage, but Wahl refuses.Knowing that this will be the last time Elfi will need to be   transfused and that Bolem\u0027s services are no longer needed, Wahl stabs   Bolem in the stomach and gets ready to conduct the transfusion himself. He   first removes Elfi\u0027s \"bad blood.\" When he looks for the serum to transfuse   into Elfi along with Liselotte\u0027s blood, he cannot find it. He finally   thinks to look in Bolem\u0027s pocket, where he finds the syringe...broken in   Bolem\u0027s fall to the floor. With Elfi drained of blood and no hope of   reviving her, Wahl sets the lab burning, grabs Elfi\u0027s body, and rushes   upstairs just as Hans and Raab break down the door into the lab. They   untie Liselotte and carry her from the burning room. As the fire spreads   through the mill, the carousel turns.

The narrator, Dr. John Markway (Richard Johnson) tells us, \"An evil old house, the kind some people call haunted is like an undiscovered country waiting to be explored. Hill House had stood for 90 years and might stand for 90 more. Silence lay steadily against the wood and stone of Hill House. Whatever walked there walked alone.\" Title and credits follow, then narration continues, \"Scandal, murder, insanity, suicide: The history of Hill House was ideal. It had everything I wanted...\" The house was built in New England by a man named Hugh Crain for his wife and young daughter. A horse and carriage accident took the life of the first Mrs. Crain (an uncredited Pamela Buckley) before she even saw the house. Hugh Crain (an uncredited Howard Lang) and young daughter, Abigail (an uncredited Janet Mansell) said a few words over the body, but Hugh was left an embittered man. Crain married again, and the second Mrs. Crain (an uncredited Freda Knorr) also died, falling down the main staircase. Hugh Crain left Abigail with a nurse (an uncredited Susan Richards) and went to England where he died in a drowning accident. Abigail kept the same nursery room her entire life. By the time she was eighty (an uncredited Amy Dalby) she was a bedridden invalid. Her nurse-companion (an uncredited Rosemary Dorken) was a local girl and, it is with this young companion the evil reputation of Hill House really begins. The old lady died while calling for help. The companion was trysting on the verandah with a farm hand. The companion inherited Hill House and occupied it for many years, but eventually hanged herself. The house then passed to a distant relative, named Mrs. Sanderson (Fay Compton). Markway visits Mrs. Sanderson where he convinces her to let him use the house for psychic research. He explains, \"I shall occupy the house with a group of carefully selected assistants...I must have specially qualified help to take notes and document any evidence of the supernatural I may find.\" Eldridge Harper (Ronald Adam), Mrs. Sanderson\u0027s lawyer, voices his concern about publicity seekers and the propriety of having women in the house. Harper suggests to Mrs. Sanderson that her nephew, Luke, joins the doctor at Hill House, as he expects to inherit the property. Mrs. Sanderson asks point blank, \"Exactly what do you and your assistants expect to find at Hill House?\" Markway replies, \"Maybe only a few loose floorboards, and maybe, I only say maybe, the key to another world.\"Dr. Markway, taking a leave of absence from his university professorship, finalizes his list of assistants. Only two end up accepting, Eleanor Lance and Theodora (no last name). Eleanor Lance (Julie Harris) is living with her sister. She is nearly broke and weary after looking after her invalid mother non-stop for eleven years. Mother is now dead, and she fights with her sister over just about everything. She begs to use the car, which is after all, half hers. Her brother-in-law, Bud Fredericks (an uncredited Paul Maxwell) tries to act as mediator between Eleanor and his wife, Carrie (Diane Clare). He is sympathetic to Eleanor\u0027s plight, but their daughter, Dora (an uncredited Verina Greenlaw) takes her cues from her mother, and taunts her Aunt Eleanor. On the vacation plan, Bud sides with Eleanor, \"I think you should have a vacation, Nell.\" Carrie objects, but Eleanor is not to be deterred and she shows her family how she reacts when pushed to her breaking point. She is normally quiet and meek, but when pushed is loud and assertive. Nell decides to take the car and confronts the garage attendant (an uncredited Claude Jones) for the keys. She departs Boston along U.S. 50 and Route 238 to Hill House. We hear Nell thinking and she reveals she will never return to live with her sister. In fact, most of what we learn of Eleanor is hearing her thoughts.Eleanor arrives at Hill House. The property is surrounded by a stone wall and the entrance by a tall, iron spiked, gate. She honks the car horn, and Mr. Dudley (Valentine Dyall), the cranky caretaker, finally deigns to respond. \"What do you want?\" he asks. Eleanor explains that she is expected. After an impertinent exchange with Eleanor, Dudley finally opens the gate and allows her to enter the property. Eleanor is the first to arrive and drives up to the house. Along the way she stops to look at it. It is a huge, stone mansion with lots of detail on the façade and steep, pitched roofs. Her first reaction is that the house is vile and it is staring at her. She carries her suitcase to the front door and is greeted by Mrs. Dudley (Rosalie Crutchley). Mrs. Dudley reluctantly allows Eleanor to come inside, but does not utter a word to her. The inside of the house is dark and over-decorated, and Eleanor is escorted to her room. Mrs. Dudley explains the house rules about meals, and that she won\u0027t stay in the house after dark. Eleanor checks out the bathroom and hears the next guest arrive. Theodora (Claire Bloom) introduces herself. Eleanor explains they share a bathroom. Mrs. Dudley repeats her meal and departure rules by rote, but Theo and Nell ignore her. Theodora is a bit strange to Eleanor (Theo clearly flirts with Eleanor throughout the film) Theodora\u0027s sexual orientation is only hinted at, and we later learn she has the gift of ESP. Theo and Nell explore the house, but they get lost. Both women feel a chill, and Nell observes, \"The house, it\u0027s alive.\" Theo seems to feel that the house wants Nell. Dr. Markway appears and explains he left the door opened, but it closed itself. Markway gives the women a tour of part of the house, starting with the main purple parlor, which they will use as an operations center. He explains that all the doors were set slightly off-center, so they close themselves. Despite studying plans to the house, even Markway gets lost on his way to the dining room. They hear a noise, but it turns out to be Luke Sanderson (Russ Tamblyn) mixing a pitcher of martinis as he enters the dining room. Luke serves each person a martini. They sit down for dinner and discuss their duties and responsibilities. Markway explains that Theo was accepted because of her remarkable power of ESP and Eleanor had a poltergeist experience as a child, \"showers of stone fell on your house for three days when you were 10 years old.\" Luke is a non-believer. His interest is to financially exploit Hill House, after he inherits it, of course.That evening, in the parlor, Markway works on his notes while Eleanor sits quietly on the couch. Theo and Luke play gin rummy at the game table. Theo\u0027s ability to see cards allows her to win five games in a row, much to Luke annoyance. She demands he pay her the $12 he owes, but he refuses because she cheated. The four decide to turn in for the night and continue the tour the next morning. Markway gives them papers and asks that they complete them with their observations each night.Sometime during the night, Eleanor wakes, and still in a near dream state, thinks she hears her mother knocking on the wall. Theo hears it from the next room also and calls to Nell. The two women are frightened and both hear the pounding noise. It comes and goes, but louder each time. They finally hear a woman shrieking and laughing that fades away. When Nell opens the door she sees Luke and Markway in the hall outside. The men explain they were chasing a dog and followed it outside, but they did not hear the loud noises the women heard. Markway concludes that something is trying to separate the men and women.The next morning, Markway and Nell join for breakfast. Nell is starting to develop romantic feelings for John Markway, unaware that he is married. She tells him that she spent eleven years taking care of her invalid mother. Nell also voices her fear that she will be turned out of Hill House with no where to go. Markway tells Nell how he came to do psychic research, and that his family disapproves. Theo joins the pair and warns the doctor, \"If anyone gets hurt, it\u0027s going to be your fault, Markway.\" Markway explains that no one has ever been physically hurt by a ghost. Luke enters and directs his companions to something he saw in the hall. Someone or something has handwritten a message in chalk on the wall. It says, \"Help Eleanor Come Home.\" Eleanor reacts strongly. She first accuses Theo of playing a cruel joke. The two women bicker and Markway postpones the tour and tells Theo to take Eleanor to her room.The tour starts with the greenhouse. A large stone sculpture sits in the center of the room. It is supposed to be St. Francis curing the lepers, but Luke thinks its a family portrait of Hugh Crain and his wives and daughter. Suddenly, the door slams open and a gust of wind moves the plants. They approach the library, but Nell refuses to enter. The smell reminds her of her mother\u0027s sick room. Prominent in the room is a very tall, wrought iron, spiral staircase. Markway points out that the balcony high above is where the companion to Abigail Crain hanged herself. Luke climbs up a few feet on the staircase, but jumps back to the ground when it starts to sway and shake. Eleanor ventures out to the verandah and nearly falls over the balcony as she looks up to the tower above the library. Markway threatens to send her home, but Nell begs to stay. Markway suggests Theo and Nell share a bedroom... \"like sisters\". That evening, the two women discuss their lives and plans for the future. Nell makes up a story about having an apartment of her own. Just when Theo is about to make a move onto Nell, Markway calls them and Luke into the hallway outside the Nursery. He has discovered a cold spot. He invites all to experience the phenomenon. He gleefully explains, \"A cold spot, a genuine cold spot. I guarantee it won\u0027t register on any thermometer.\" Luke dismisses it as just a draft, but Markway says it is the heart of Hill House: The Nursery.In the middle of the night, Nell awakens. She hears a little girl laughing. She asks Theo to hold her hand, as their two beds are almost touching. The laughter continues and Nell complains, \"Theo, you\u0027re breaking my hand.\" The laughs turn to wimpering and Nell complains that something is hurting a child and she won\u0027t allow that to happen. She yells, \"Stop It!\" Theo turns on the light and we see Nell is on a day bed about twenty feet from the bed Theo occupies. Nell stares at her hand and asks, \"Whose hand was I holding?\" The next morning, Markway is in the music room and checks his watch and makes a note about the harp playing itself. Nell enters the room and asks about how it could play itself. Markway explains that it may be preternatural: Something we don\u0027t have any natural explanation for right now, but probably will have some day. Nell voices her fear that it is all in her imagination and concludes she may be going insane. She is haunted by the circumstances of her mother\u0027s death and that she may somehow be responsible. They both hear the harp play a note and Markway again checks his watch and makes a note in his paperwork.That evening, Luke finds a disturbing book that Hugh Crain made for his daughter, Abigail. Nell and Theo bicker and Markway notes that everyone\u0027s nerves are on edge. Theo continues to flirt as well as needle Nell, this time about a budding romance she fantasizes about with John Markway. Nell runs away and Theo catches up to her, and tells Nell that is he is making a fool of herself in thinking that Dr. Markway will ever get involved with her. Nell accuses Theo of being an \"unnatural thing\" as well as a \"nature\u0027s mistake.\" At that moment, a car horn honks and a taxi pulls up in front of the house. Grace Markway (Lois Maxwell), John\u0027s wife, arrives. She informs her husband, \"A reporter\u0027s been telephoning all day. He\u0027s on your track. He\u0027s heard about you renting this place.\" Grace begs her husband to abandon the house and his research. When John refuses, Grace pays the driver, grabs her suitcase and announces she is staying at Hill House, \"to join the ghost hunt.\" When Eleanor casually mentions the nursery as a place to stay, Grace quickly accepts the challenge, \"Thank you, my dear. The nursery it is.\" Markway and Nell try to dissuade her, but Grace responds, \"You insult my intelligence. You don\u0027t think I\u0027d believe anything you ghost hunters might tell me.\" Luke notices the door to the nursery is open for the first time. Grace decides to spend the night in the room, despite everyone\u0027s warning not to. Markway insists he and the three researchers spend the night downstairs in the parlor.Later that night, Nell and Theo sleep together on the sofa by the fireplace as Markway sleeps in a chair. Luke finishes his tour upstairs and enters the parlor. He heads for a bottle on the mantle. Suddenly, the parlor door slams shut by itself and the others wake with a start. They hear a deep rhythmic banging outside the door. Markway is concerned about his wife upstairs. Next a very loud banging comes from just outside the door. The unseen phantom presses against the parlor door as it bows inward and out like breathing, creaking and crunching against the hinges. The sound moves to overhead towards the nursery. Markway is desperate to check on his wife. Unseen, Nell runs from the parlor, through the music room, and upstairs directly to the nursery room. The doors are open, but Grace Markway is nowhere to be seen. Her bed shows signs of being used. Markway and the others arrive and start the search. Nell wanders away. She finds herself in the greenhouse. Descending into her own little world, Nell dances out onto the verandah. When she hears the others calling to her, Nell runs into the Library. She is drawn to the spiral staircase and the balcony at the top. Before she reaches the top, the rickety staircase begins its swaying, the lateral support bolts pulling away from the wall. Markway calls to her, begging her to carefully walk back down. She ignores him and stands on the balcony. Markway carefully climbs the stairs and joins Nell on the iron balcony platform. Before they walk back down, Nell sees Grace Markway peer at her through a trap door in the ceiling.A little later, Markway is furious and now insists Eleanor leave the house for her own safety. Luke brings her car around and Theo packs her bag. Nell tries to talk them out of her dismissal, but the three insist she leave. They escort Eleanor out to her car. Luke gets back out of Nell\u0027s car to retrieve the gate key from Markway. She drives off without Luke. Before she reaches the gate she is distracted by the white-robed figure of Grace Markway and crashes into a tree. The three find Eleanor dead in the half overturned car. She crashed into the same tree that killed the first Mrs. Crain. Grace wanders over to the accident scene. She explains to her husband, \"I didn\u0027t want any of this to happen. You must believe me, John.\" She explains that she woke and was frightened. She got lost looking for her husband and ended up in the attic. While Theo blames Grace for Eleanor\u0027s accident, Luke takes a different view. \"Eleanor did it to herself. It looked to me, anyway, like she deliberately aimed the car at this tree.\" Markway blames the house. Luke stares at the house and remarks, \"It ought to be burned down and the ground sowed with salt.\" We close with an evening shot of Hill House with Eleanor, now a ghost, narrating from beyond the grave about Hill House and that \"we who walk here... walk alone.\" The end title comes up as well as the final title card \u0027The Haunting\u0027 followed by eerie piano music.","numvotes":"38733","primarytitle":"The Haunting"},"color":"rgb(93,99,84)","size":1.0},{"source":"Thriller","target":"tt1772770","id":"7076","attributes":{"productioncompany":"Wisdom Productions","countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"4.8","titletype":"movie","notes":"Anthology collection","originaltitle":"Book of 1000 Deaths","storyline":"Four stories that are more than just myths or fairy tales; these are urban legends with endings that are far from happy. \"The Clown Statue\" with Jasmine a college freshman struggling to make ends meet finds no fun in babysitting. \"Kidney Jacking\" where Misti an everyday nine to five office assistant has the worst Friday when she finds her boyfriend doing the unthinkable.

Betty plans to roast him in her oven and serve him at a dinner party for more of her witch friends. To pass the time in his cell, Betty had given Timmy an old, thick book called \"Tales From the Darkside\". When she reveals her plans for him, Timmy begins to stall her by reading her some of the stories.The first story is called \"Lot 249\". At a prestigious university, a nerdy student, Bellingham, is bullied by two rich students, Susan and Lee, who are quite contemptuous of him because he\u0027s a work-study student. Susan\u0027s brother, Andy, helps Bellingham one night with a new specimen that has arrived in the archeology department: an ancient mummy. Speaking about how the ancient Egyptians would draw the corpse\u0027s brains out through it\u0027s nose with a hook and stuff vegetables into it\u0027s abdomen, Bellingham finds the incision in the mummy\u0027s abdomen where his preparers had stuffed him with herbs and onions. Bellingham also finds an ancient scroll and remarks that it\u0027s fairly worthless. Andy leaves and Bellingham reads the scroll, finding a spell that will bring the mummy to life to be his servant. Bellingham been cheated out of a teaching assistant\u0027s position in his department, an incident that somehow involved both Susan and Lee.Bellingham brings the mummy to life and sends it after Lee. It stalks Lee through his apartment, finally cornering him and forcing a hooked wire hanger up his nose, killing him. Susan returns home to find Lee\u0027s brain on a table in the front hall and Lee himself partially wrapped in cloth bandages. The mummy attacks her, chasing her through the house, where she becomes lodged in the broken window of the front door. The mummy uses a large pair of scissors and slashes her back open, stuffing the wound with flowers from a vase.Andy goes to Lee and Susan\u0027s place and finds them both dead. Suspicious of Bellingham, he goes to Bellingham\u0027s apartment and find him there with the mummy. He knocks Bellingham unconscious and ties him up. When Bellingham comes to, Andy demands that he turn over the scroll. Bellingham refuses at first and then begins to recite the incantation to bring the mummy to life and attack Andy. Andy is able to defend himself quite easily with an electric carving knife, dismembering the mummy. Bellingham finally directs Andy to a scroll, which he burns in the fireplace, along with the mummy\u0027s limbs. Bellingham ultimately leaves the university. While he rides away in a cab, he chuckles to himself. The driver asks him what he\u0027s laughing about \u0026 Bellingham tells him that a person like Andy would never know the difference between one ancient scroll and another - the scroll he reads is the actual one from the mummy. He recites from it and rides off. Later, Andy answers his door and finds Susan and Lee standing there, re-animated as mummies, ready to kill him.Back in Betty\u0027s kitchen, she tells Timmy that she knows he\u0027s trying to stall his death. Timmy convinces her to let him tell another story and she listens to him read \"Cat From Hell.\"Halston, a high-priced assassin, arrives at an old mansion, having been summoned there by an old man in a wheelchair, Drogan. Drogan tells Halston that he has an unusual mark for him to dispatch: a black cat. The cat has supposedly killed Halston\u0027s sisters, Carolyn and Amanda. Both sisters had befriended the cat, feeding it and showing it affection over Drogan\u0027s objections that it was evil. Carolyn was killed when the cat, sitting on a staircase riser, tripped over it and fell to her death. Amanda had been killed when the cat laid on her face while she was asleep.Halston is skeptical. Drogan introduces him to the cat, which sits quietly in Halston\u0027s lap for a few minutes. When Halston smirks at the ease of such a lucrative job, he tries to strangle the cat. The cat slashes him with it\u0027s claws and escapes. Drogan tells Halston that his pharmaceutical company had tested a new medication on thousands of subjects, all of them cats. He now believes the cat has been sent to take revenge on him and his family.Drogan leaves the house, bidding Halston to kill the cat by the time he comes home and also suggesting he not get angry, which will cloud his ability to kill it. Drogan checks over his weapons and tries several methods of killing the cat, all of which fail. When the cat leaps at him and scratches his neck, Halston becomes furious. At one point he tricks the cat into approaching and eating from a dish of food - he uses a laser sighting scope to target the cat, fires his pistol and misses. Fully enraged, Halston chases the cat through the house. The cat, suddenly leaping on to and knocking Halston down, then forces itself into his mouth, crawls down his esophagus and roosts in his stomach.Just before the stroke of midnight, Drogan returns and finds Halston dead on the floor. The cat crawls out of Halston\u0027s body and leaps onto Drogan\u0027s lap. Drogan has a heart attack and dies.In Betty\u0027s kitchen, Betty herself is impatient with Timmy, who persuades her to listen to one final story from the book, \"Lover\u0027s Vow\".An out-of-work artist, Preston, is being told by his agent that he can\u0027t help him if he can\u0027t overcome his creator\u0027s block. The two leave the bar they\u0027d met at; in the alley outside, Preston\u0027s friend is attacked by a monstrous gargoyle, who decapitates the man with one slash of it\u0027s claws. Preston shrinks in terror, begging for his life. The gargoyle makes him promise that he\u0027ll never speak of what he saw or the creature that committed the murder. The gargoyle also slashes Preston\u0027s body as a reminder. Preston promises to keep his vow and the beast flies off.On his way home Preston meets a beautiful woman, Carola. Telling her that the neighborhood is dangerous, he takes her home with him. The two have sex together and fall in love, eventually marrying and having a boy and a girl. Preston also finds that his creativity has returned and he enjoys a successful period of production. However, he is still torn with guilt over the murder of his friend and occasionally draws pictures of the beast, which he is careful to keep from Carola and his children.By the time 10 years have passed since Preston witnessed the murder, he decides to tell Carola about the night he met her. He shows her a small sculpture of the gargoyle he\u0027d kept hidden. When Carola sees it, she lets out a mournful scream and begins to transform, saying that Preston had broken his promise - she, herself, is the gargoyle. Preston is shocked and horrified, even more so when their children begin to transform into gargoyles themselves. Carola tells him she\u0027s sorry and kills him. She gathers her children together and flies off, breaking through their skylight and settling on a high ledge of a nearby building. They turn to stone, staring mournfully down at Preston\u0027s body.Back in the witch\u0027s kitchen, Betty tells Timmy his time\u0027s up. She approaches him with a butcher knife and the keys to his cell and shackles. Timmy frantically tells her he has one more story to tell, one not from the book. Timmy throws some marbles in Betty\u0027s path and she slips on them, falling backwards on to the skewers she\u0027d set out. Timmy manages to reach the keys while Betty struggles in pain and he frees himself. He gives her a hard shove, sending her into her own oven, which he slams shut, roasting her alive. Timmy seizes the package of cookies Betty had been feeding him and breaks the \"fourth wall\" by asking the audience, \"Don\u0027t you just love happy endings?\"","numvotes":"16896","primarytitle":"Tales from the Darkside: The Movie"},"color":"rgb(117,90,85)","size":2.0},{"source":"Comedy","target":"tt0410730","id":"6910","attributes":{"notes":"Truly weird and disturbing film","runtimeminutes":"91","sex of killer":"male","synopsis":"The focus of Taxidermia is mood, tone and visuals rather than a specific plot narrative. The summary presented here relays the events in the film, but the manner in which they are presented in the film is equally if not more important that the events themselves. This summary should not be considered an adequate substitute for the experience of actually watching the film.Note: Hungarian names in the film and this summary are in \"Eastern order\" (family name first.)Morosgoványi Vendel (Csaba Czene) is a lowly soldier/orderly stationed at a remote Hungarian farmhouse in WWII. The farmhouse is occupied by Lieutenant Balatony Lajoska (Marc Bischoff), his obese wife (Viktória Kiss), and their two teenage daughters. Morosgoványi lives in a crude shed with pigs and spends much time having sexual fantasies about the young girls, typically while spying on them, masturbating or experimenting with his remarkable ability to shoot flames out of the end of his penis.Following the slaughter of one of the hogs, Morosgoványi is propositioned by Mrs. Balatony who pulls Morosgoványi down upon her in the wooden bathtub containing the pig carcass. They have vigorous and loud sex, with Morosgoványi fantasizing that he\u0027s actually screwing the Balatony daughters. Upon finishing, Morosgoványi falls asleep and it is apparent that he was fantasizing the entire encounter while actually copulating with the dead pig.The next morning, Lt. Balatony kicks open the door to the shed, and shoots the slowly awakening Morosgoványi in the back of the head, blowing his brains out. Mrs Balatony subsequently gives birth to a very large, fat baby. The lieutenant examines the boy lying in the wooden bathtub and discovers a pig-like tail on him. Without speaking a word, he retrieves a pair of pliers from the shed, calmly snips off the tail, and slaps the boy on the rump.Thirty years later Balatony Kálmán (Trócsányi Gergõ) still has his tail stump, and has grown into a hefty professional speed eater. In an stadium full of cheering fans, Kálmán and his friend Miszlényi Béla (Koppány Zoltán) compete for Hungary against the Russian team, shoveling huge spoonfuls of offal and other disgusting material into their mouths in an attempt to finish their enormous helpings first.Narrowly losing the initial round, Kálmán is berated by his uncle/coach for being distracted by Aczél Gizi (Stanczel Adél), the women\u0027s speed-eating champion who is present in the audience and cheering for both him and Béla, who also fancies Gizi. During the break between rounds, Kálmán and Béla trade jibes over Gizi while casually regurgitating the meal they have just gorged themselves.After wiping their mouths off, the competitors face up to the next round - chosen by the Russians to be a giant blob of gelatin/fat with various disgusting animal parts congealed within. Still distracted by Gizi, Kálmán suffers an attack of lock-jaw, and - unable to get the spoon out of his mouth - collapses backwards.Béla visits Kálmán, who is recovering in hospital with an enormous scar on his chest, Gizi by his side. Béla and Gizi blatantly flirt yet Kálmán appears not to mind, instead savoring the drop of sweat that falls onto his face from Gizi\u0027s hairy armpit. At his subsequent wedding to Gizi, Kálmán sings a folorn song about unrequited love while Béla convinces Gizi to \"elope\" with him. The \"elopement\" consists of taking her outside and drunkenly screwing her from behind while she looks through the window at her husband.We next see a sports factory where fat young boys are apprenticed to a government program to develop world-class speed eaters. Seated at an enormous trough of semolina, the stern coach blankets the trough with a few scoops of cocoa powder before starting the boys off on their training. In an office above the factory floor Kálmán is in training and is frustrated. Just at the time when he is attempting his professional comeback from injury, the International Olympic Committee has refused to recognize sport eating. While vomiting into a recycling machine, he complains to his coach.Gizi discovers that she is pregnant. Her and Kálmán\u0027s joy is obvious, but they are concerned by the Communist rules which require pregnant women to be reassigned to a particular factory which would negatively affect her calorie intake and thus her competitiveness in sport eating. They bribe the obstetrician, who gives them a choice between \"cyst\" and \"myeoma\" as a diagnosis which will apparently enable special treatment.While on holidays at the seaside, the famous Kálmán and Gizi are playfully suggesting names for their child when they are \"invited\" aboard the yacht of a visiting Russian dignitary. Before boarding, a flunky explains that they are expected to give a demonstration of their sport. Specifically, this involves eating 45kg of caviar (with a few bacon hocks thrown in) within 20 minutes. Gizi clearly struggles, perhaps concerned for the baby. Beneath decks, Kálmán supports her by reminding her of her previous glories. Back upstairs they are expected to attend dinner, but Gizi is so sick that she passes out face-first onto her plate.Another thirty years pass. We see Balatony Lajoska (Marc Bischoff), - painfully thin - at work at his taxidermy business. Cluttered throughout with various animals, the workshop shows a man who is dedicated to his work. Lajoska leaves his shop and travels to the grocery store where he purchases a huge volume of butter and chocolate. He is obviously smitten by the checkout girl, who ignores his creepy attempts at making eye contact. Lajoska visits the apartment of his father Kálmán, who is now a ridiculously immense naked blob of shapeless flesh. The chocolate bars are for Kálmán, who boasts that by leaving the silver wrappers on he can increase his intake from 400 to 570 per hour. The butter is for Kálmán\u0027s super-sized cats, who lurk menacingly behind iron bars in their porcelain-tiled lair.Kálmán clearly despises his son, partly because of his profession (\"carcass stuffer\") but mostly because he is so skinny. Lajoska endures a barrage of insults from his father as he cleans the house and the cage. Kálmán is too fat to move and even needs his son to change his bedpan for him. Kálmán\u0027s life revolves around his enormous cats and his television, which he swears at while watching his former wife Gizi coaching an American champion speed eater.Back at his taxidermy shop, Lajoska is asked by a dapper businessman for his help regarding a special project. \"Domestic or wild?\" The businessman smirks and admits \"Domestic\". Peering into the customer\u0027s paper bag, Lajoska nods and accepts the work.Again at the grocery store, the same shopping list and the same uncomfortable stare at the checkout. At Kálmán\u0027s apartment, his father needles Lajoska with continued insults. When he calls his son \"cyst\", Lajoska angrily confronts him about how ungrateful he has been. The two get into a terrible argument, throwing chocolate bars at each other. Lajoska storms out suddenly, telling his father he can die for all he cares.Lajoska throws himself into his work. We see extreme closeups of his work under a magnifying class as he prepares various animals for mounting. Back at the grocery store a few days later, Lajoska is buying a small amount of butter and chocolate; the fight with his father was probably the latest in a long series. The female clerk is gone, replaced by a man.At Kálmán\u0027s apartment, Lajoska realizes something is wrong. Having left the cage open after their terrible fight, the cats have attacked and killed Kálmán, chewing a hole into his enormous gut. A string of entrails leads back into the cage where a pair of satisfied cats sit licking their chops.Lajoska embalms his father, stuffing straw into his stomach through the holes the cats gnawed. We next see him strapped standing into an elaborate contraption in the basement of his workshop. Pumps slowly sigh, liquid flows through clear tubes, syringes dive into flesh, and trays of scalpels and other vicious medical instruments move past on articulated arms.With the aid of mirrors, clamps and levers, Lajoska begins the exacting and painstaking work of eviscerating himself. There is no doubt as to his intentions and progress; we are shown in exacting detail scalpels slicing flesh, opening body cavities, removing organs. Lajoska guts himself in front of us.With trembling hands, obviously exhausted from his work, Lajoska finally sews up his own sweating torso. Completing the taxidermy, he pushes a button and we see a razor-sharp blade crank slowly around to the front his neck. After a few calm breaths, the blade is released and via a spring it whips around behind, decapitating Lajoska. A moment later, a saw falls on his right arm, blood gushing as it\u0027s severed just below the shoulder.We cut to the businessman returning to the shop. Unable to locate the proprietor, he goes into the back room and discovers, in the same paper bag, the completed work he requested of Lajoska: a glass globe containing a tiny human fetus. Satisfied, he is about to leave a stack of cash on the bench, when he changes his mind. Venturing further into the shop, he eventually makes his way down to the basement where he discovers Lajoska.We cut immediately to the same businessman at an avant-garde art gallery, lauding the artistic genius of Balatony Lajoska. The glitterati are drinking champagne and eating hors dourves from a porcelain pig.On display in the gallery are two exhibits: firstly: Balatony Kálmán, resplendent in golden tights with a snarl of cat fur protruding from the hole in his magnificent belly, but primarily Balatony Lajoska - minus his head and right arm, standing casually naked with a stitched torso, looking more like a classical Greek statue than a man who mutilated himself.","numvotes":"17441","primarytitle":"Taxidermia","productioncompany":"Amour Fou Vienna","countriesoforigin":"Hungary, Austria, France","averagerating":"6.8","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"Taxidermia","sex of artist":"male","storyline":"Three generations of men, including a pervert that constantly seeks for new kinds of satisfaction, an obese speed eater and a passionate embalmer.","startyear":"2006","role of artist":"killer"},"color":"rgb(117,90,85)","size":3.0},{"source":"comes to life","target":"tt0061826","id":"6971","attributes":{"notes":"Golem theme","runtimeminutes":"96","synopsis":"After one of their storehouses burned down, the museum director and his assistant Pimm find everything destroyed with one exception; a statue withstood the fire undamaged.

Meanwhile, other strange phenomena presents itself to Father Lyle Dey (George Newbern), who experiences nightmares of a ghostly unknown presence. At the same time, Beth Patterson (Gabrielle Anwar) is haunted by nightmares of a girl she does not recognize. She has become obsessed with this unknown girl, sculpting her face into clay and repeatedly asking the sculpture to tell her who she is. While sculpting, Beth ignores a call from her therapist, who leaves a message expressing concern over Beth\u0027s nightmares and the added stress of the recent suicide of a childhood friend. As the message is playing, Beth becomes more and more stressed, eventually ripping the jaw off of the clay face.Soon thereafter, Jennifer, Lyle, and Beth gather at the funeral of their mutual childhood friend, along with three other old friends: Brent Sykes (Frank Whaley), Gina Conte (Traci Lords), and Wayne Morrison (Dan DeLuca). After the funeral, the six leave the graveyard and go to their friend\u0027s home. Following instructions in their friend\u0027s will, they look for and find a box containing a letter and a map.

The letter apologizes for the friend\u0027s suicide but asks that the remaining friends face the past and the things forgotten together. The letter ends by reminding them that they will always be together. The only other item in the box is an old photograph of eight children standing in front of a baseball field. Brent comments that their group must not have been very bright since a baseball team requires at least nine players, not eight, but Lyle chides him by saying that Crazy Eights was simply a name.The six travel to their childhood hometown and use the map to find an old, dilapidated barn, where the time capsule has been placed in the upper level. The group opens the box to find various items that they owned in their youth, including Beth\u0027s paint brushes, a journal (which once belonged to the deceased friend), a slingshot, and a few other items. They decide to move the box outside by using a pulley to carry it out of a nearby window. While Jennifer, Lyle and Brent are attempting to lift the box out, Beth and Wayne talk outside. Beth notices a new scar on Wayne\u0027s forehead; when she asks him about it, he confesses that he does not know how he got it, and that the cut appeared right after a disturbing nightmare he had. Suddenly, the box drops behind them and smashes, having slipped from the pulley.When the group goes to the box again, they find that the bottom has split open, revealing a secret compartment which contains the skeleton of a tiny girl. The group is unsure of what to do, debating whether to simply leave or to involve the authorities. Brent angrily leaves the group, refusing to accept any responsibility or consequences for the unknown skeleton.Upon realizing that Brent still has the keys to the van, the others quickly catch up to him, although they are still undecided as to what to do about the box and its grisly contents. As the group attempts to drive away, they find themselves lost and continually returning to a large white house no matter which direction they travel in. Brent notices a figure standing near a few trees surrounding the house, and quickly leads the group to her location. The girl disappears once the group heads towards her, so they decide to enter the home to search for her. The group agrees to split up into two groups, in the hopes of finding the girl faster.Wayne and Gina walk around outside and find the entrance to the basement. Upon entering, Wayne just makes out the shadow of a person, but falls down the stairs and breaks his leg. Gina turns the basement\u0027s lights on as Wayne begs her not to leave him alone in the dark, and sets out for help. Meanwhile, the group inside sees that the house does not look as though anyone has lived there for a long time; Brent soon discovers a \"Condemned\" notice, stating that all trespassers will be shot without warning. Gina finds the others and notifies the rest of the group of Wayne\u0027s injury, and the group descends into the basement to aid Wayne, with Brent bringing anything from the van that might help them.Once all members of the group are in the basement, the door strangely shuts and locks. The group, now looking for any way out of the house, leave with Wayne in tow and travel down a tunnel which they hope will lead them to another exit. The tunnel opens out into an abandoned underground hospital, complete with an empty nurse\u0027s station and rooms with hospital beds. The group decides to split up again to search for an exit or anything that might help them. The group leaves Wayne in Beth\u0027s care, but she soon abandons Wayne to explore the halls and rooms. She stares into a mirror hanging off a wall at the nurse\u0027s station, and is startled to see her younger self staring back at her.Meanwhile, the abandoned Wayne hears a noise behind him and crawls over to a nearby window to investigate, the window inexplicably opened even though the outside is covered by bars. Behind him, a ghostly figure passes by and the window is suddenly closed, killing Wayne. The group soon returns to find Wayne\u0027s body, and upon managing to get him out, temporarily transfer it to the attic. Lyle and Gina take an obviously disturbed Beth to a room serving as a bedroom for multiple children in order to calm her down.Beth demands to be left alone, and Lyle and Gina reluctantly comply. When left alone, Beth begins sucking her thumb, and lies on a bed. Soon, a horrible creature visits, promising to remove her guilt if she \" reaches down, and pulls it out.\" Beth screams in response, and when the other five reenter the room, they find Beth\u0027s bloody body lying crumpled against a wall with her jaw torn off. This is eerily similar to the fate of Beth\u0027s sculpture she had crafted at the beginning of the story.Brent panics and flees the room, running away from the remaining members of the group. He enters a series of adjoined, lighted rooms, before discovering that again, the series of rooms loop in circles, with no exit. Brent yells and curses at whoever is tormenting him, and promises that when he escapes the building, he will burn it to the ground.Brent eventually returns to the other four. Gina, Lyle and Brent return to the room where they saw her reflection and break the mirror, discovering that it was a two-way mirror used to watch the previous occupants of the home. Brent somehow finds an exit, which leads to a room filled with a plethora of toys, and a large painting on the wall. Brent explains that \"compassion is the difference between a man and a beast.\" The remainder of the group walks along the length of the hall exposed by the broken mirror, eventually arriving at a room containing records. The records document the progress of \"subjects,\" among which were a savant and an autistic individual.Lyle comes to the conclusion that they were trying to teach these unfortunate subjects guilt. However, Jennifer rampages through the room and exposes a large butterfly graffiti made by the group when they were children. They discover a picture frame containing pictures of all of them as children, including the man who each child believed was his or her own father.Brent, meanwhile, drops to his knees and reads several quotes from a book in the time capsule, talking about how they cannot run. He comes to some sort of realization but a figure emerges from a pile of toys behind him and kills him before he can express it. Lyle suddenly recollects old, repressed memories hidden by pain and horror, about how the group of eight children escaped this home, where they had been experimented on.He recounts how they were forced to leave one of the members of the group, a fragile young girl named Karen, in a chest containing meaningful objects, promising to return and rescue her. He realizes that the time capsule is the chest, and that they had come back for the girl long ago, only to find her dead from suffocation. Gina, horrified by this realization, runs into a bathroom, vomiting in the toilet. The bathroom is filled with multiple bathtubs, and she leans against one, moaning. Suddenly, the horrible creature who took the lives of Wayne, Beth, and Brent emerges behind her and blinds her by gouging her eyes out. She begins to scream as Lyle and Jennifer race towards the bathroom, but the door is locked.Lyle and Jennifer manage to batter their way into the room, and quickly bind Gina\u0027s bleeding eyes with strips of cloth. They take her to the storage room, and leave her there, promising to return soon. Lyle convinces Jennifer that they must find and destroy all objects linking them to the dead girl, and implores her to split up to find the objects in a reduced amount of time. Gina reminds Lyle that Brent left a slingshot under a grate, near a truncated tunnel. Lyle finds the area, and reaches down to acquire the slingshot, when a hand grabs his. He quickly struggles and stumbles back, severely wounding his neck on a pike.Meanwhile, Jennifer finds a paintbrush under a filthy bed, and begins to walk back to the room where Gina is. The blinded Gina, unaware of her surroundings and left with a metal bar to defend herself, inadvertently kills Lyle when he enters the room. In Lyle\u0027s last breaths, he tells Gina that yet another object is in the tunnel. Gina runs back to the entrance of the basement, where a horrible creature behind her clasps its hand over Gina\u0027s mouth, suffocating her. Jennifer returns to the room, finding Lyle dead. She pleads for the resurrection of the dead man, before gathering the courage to burn the slingshot and the paintbrush in a garbage can.While burning the objects, the horrible creature (who is revealed to be Karen, the dead girl\u0027s spirit) who led the other group members to their deaths, taunts Jennifer, reminding her of how she left her in the chest. Jennifer asks, with a raising temper in her voice, what objects are left to burn.When she does not receive an answer, she deduces that she herself is the only thing left connected to Karen. While Jennifer prepares to plunge a shard of glass into her stomach to kill herself, a flashback is shown where a man talks to Karen about the \"project\" is shown, and the movie abruptly ends with the words, \"Do you know the meaning of guilt? Do you know the meaning of redemption?

He is there to follow up on a letter addressed specifically to him from an anonymous source on Summerisle reporting that a twelve year old girl who lives on the island, Rowan Morrison, the daughter of May Morrison, has long been missing. The correspondence includes a photograph of Rowan. Upon his arrival on Summerisle, Howie finds that the locals are a seemingly simple minded lot who provide little information beyond the fact that they know of no Rowan Morrison and do not know the girl in the photo. Mrs. Morrison admits to having a daughter, seven year old Myrtle, but no Rowan. As Howie speaks to more and more people, he begins to believe that Rowan does or did live on the island, but that the locals are hiding their knowledge of her. He also begins to see that the locals all have pagan beliefs, their \"religion\" which centers on procreation as the source of life. That procreation does not necessarily need to be within marriage, and openly flaunts the act of sex, both in private and in public. These beliefs do not sit well against Howie\u0027s strict Christian morals, he who regularly attends church, prays, and accepts communion. Everything that happens on the island seems to be dictated by Lord Summerisle, whose ancestors bought the island generations ago. Howie begins to believe that Rowan was murdered, she a sacrifice by the islanders to their higher power to ensure a bountiful apple crop - the main crop of the island - which did not materialize last season. With May Day approaching, Howie not only tries to find out if Rowan was indeed murdered/sacrificed, which includes trying to locate her body, but if there will be another sacrifice on this important day within the cycle of life. —Huggo","startyear":"1973","runtimeminutes":"88","synopsis":"Sergeant Neil Howie of the West Highland Police receives an anonymous letter requesting his presence on Summerisle, a remote Hebridean island famed for its popular and unusually abundant fruit produce. A young girl named Rowan Morrison has been missing for a number of months and her mother is being uncooperative with enquiries. Due to the island\u0027s isolation it is unlikely she could have left by herself, abduction is suspected.Howie, a devout and celibate Christian, travels by seaplane to the island and is profoundly disturbed to find a society that worships the old pagan, Celtic gods of their ancestors. Couples copulate openly in the fields, children are taught in school of the phallic importance of the maypole, toads are placed in the mouth to cure whooping cough, and the island has no Christian ministers or priests. Its church and graveyards have long been deconsecrated and are now used for the idiosyncratic burial rituals of the locals, who believe in re-incarnation.In the course of his investigation, Howie encounters difficulty in extracting information from the islanders, who claim never to have heard of Rowan, and whose own mother insists does not exist. Rooming at The Green Man Inn, where he is introduced to the beautiful young daughter of the landlord, Willow, Howie notices a series of photographs celebrating the island\u0027s annual harvests adorning the wall of the bar with each photograph featuring a young girl, the May Queen. The latest photograph is missing due to it being \"broken\". No negative exists.After discovering a grave bearing Rowan Morrison\u0027s name in the cemetery, Howie\u0027s search eventually brings him into contact with the island\u0027s community leader, Laird and de facto figurehead Lord Summerisle, who explains to Howie the island\u0027s recent history and culture. Summerisle\u0027s grandfather, a distinguished Victorian scientist, developed several new strains of fruit that he believed could prosper in Scotland\u0027s climate given the proper conditions. Drawn to Summerisle\u0027s unique combination of fertile, volcanic soil and local waters heated by the Gulf Stream, he inculcated in the local populace a belief that the old gods were real and worshipping them by farming the new crop strains would deliver them from their meagre livelihood. The crops bore fruit and the island\u0027s Christian clergy were driven away, with the population now embracing pagan teachings wholesale. Enraged by Summerisle\u0027s glib comment that the Christian god is \"dead\", Howie demands permission to exhume Rowan\u0027s body, which Lord Summerisle subsequently grants, confident in the belief that such a deeply religious community as his is incapabale of murder. Howie\u0027s exhumation of the grave reveals only the body of a hare. He angrily confronts Summerisle once more, declaring that he believes that Rowan Morrison was murdered as part of a pagan sacrifice and that he intends to bring the full weight of the law upon the inhabitants of the island.Breaking into the local chemist\u0027s shop, Howie discovers that a negative of last year\u0027s harvest photograph does in fact exist. It shows Rowan standing amidst a meagre, pathetic group of boxes, indicating that last year\u0027s harvest was a poor one and that the crops the island\u0027s only means of income had failed. Struck by his recollection of an offhand remark made by Lord Summerisle about appeasing the old gods \"when necessary\" and by research that indicates pagan societies offer up a human sacrifice in the event of crop failure, Howie deduces that Rowan is in fact still alive and that she is being kept hidden until she can be sacrificed as part of the May Day celebrations to ensure a plentiful harvest for the coming year.Howie spends another night at the Inn where, in the room next to his, Willow sings to him and openly attempts to seduce him. The next morning, discovering that his plane has been sabotaged and is unable to take off, Howie elects to search the island for Rowan himself ahead of the impending May Day parade. Howie ties up the innkeeper and assumes his place as Punch, a principal character of the May Day festival. Disguised, he joins the procession of islanders as they cavort through the town and perform harmless sacrifices to the various lesser gods. Then Lord Summerisle announces that a grimmer sacrifice awaits them, and Rowan is finally revealed, tied to a post. Howie cuts her free and flees through a cave but after a brief chase emerges at another entrance on a precipice where Summerisle and his followers stand waiting for them. Howie is shocked to see Rowan merrily embrace her captors and then notices that he is being surrounded.Lord Summerisle explains to Howie that, after painstaking research on their behalf, he specifically was lured to Summerisle by the islanders, who have been successful in a conspiracy to lead him to believe that a missing girl was being held captive against her will, and confirms to him that last year\u0027s harvest failed disastrously, threatening the inhabitants with a return to their previously desperate existence and that they have no intention of allowing that to happen. Their religion calls for a sacrifice to be made to the Sun god as Lord Summerisle explains that, \"animals are fine, but their acceptibility is limited. A young child is even better, but not nearly as effective as the right kind of adult.\" Howie\u0027s devout Christian lifestyle and his livelihood as a policeman mean that he meets the outstanding criteria for a human that is to be sacrificed to appease the gods he has come of his own free will, with the power of a king and he is a virgin. In spite of his protestations that the crops failed because fruit was not meant to grow on these islands and that next year the sacrifice of Lord Summerisle himself will be called for, Howie is stripped bare, then dressed in ceremonial robes and led to the summit of a cliff with his hands tied. He is horrified to find a giant, hollow wicker man statue which he is then locked inside. The statue is soon set afire. As the islanders surround the burning wicker man and sing the Middle English folk-song \"Sumer Is Icumen In\", a terrified Howie curses them and recites Psalm 23 as he prays to God for accession to Heaven. The film ends as the burning head of the wicker man falls from its shoulders, as the sun sets in a blood-red sky.","numvotes":"78669","primarytitle":"The Wicker Man"},"color":"rgb(65,97,106)","size":1.0},{"source":"weapon","target":"tt0084777","id":"7157","attributes":{"notes":"Giallo; other arts are more important","runtimeminutes":"101","sex of killer":"male","synopsis":"Peter Neal (Anthony Franciosa) is an American writer of violent horror novels whose books are tremendously popular in Europe.

He is unaware that he is also being followed by his embittered ex-wife Jane (Veronica Lario).Immediately prior to Neals arrival in Rome, a beautiful young shoplifter (Ania Pieroni) is brutally razor-slashed to death by an unseen killer. The murderer sends Neal a letter informing him that his books have inspired him to go on a killing spree. Neal immediately contacts the police, who put Detective Giermani (Giuliano Gemma) in charge of the investigation, along with the detectives female partner Inspector Altieri (Carola Stagnaro).More killings occur. Tilde (Mirella D\u0027Angelo), a beautiful lesbian journalist, is murdered at her home along with her lover by the unseen killer who has a straight-razor blade. Later, Maria (Lara Wendel), the teenage daughter of Neal\u0027s landlord, is bloodily hacked to death with an ax after stumbling into the killer\u0027s lair.Neal notices that TV interviewer Christiano Berti (John Steiner) appears to have an unusually intense interest in the novelist\u0027s work. At night, Neal and his second assistant Gianni (Christiano Borromeo) watch Berti\u0027s house for suspicious activity. Neal decides to separate from Gianni in order to get a better view. Alone, Gianni watches in horror as an ax-carrying assailant brutally hacks Berti to death. But he is unable to see the murderer\u0027s face. Gianni finds Neal unconscious on the lawn outside the open front door, claiming to have been knocked out from behind.The next day, Giermani\u0027s investigation of the crime scene reveals that Berti was unhealthily obsessed with Neal\u0027s novels, and now that he is dead it is believed that the killings will cease. However, Bullmer, who is having an affair with Jane, is stabbed to death while waiting for his lover in a public square.That evening, Gianni is haunted by the thought that he had seen, but did not recognize, something important at Berti\u0027s house during the night of the interviewer\u0027s murder. He returns to the house and suddenly remembers what was so important: he had heard Berti confessing to his unseen attacker, \"I killed them all, I killed them all!\" Before Gianni can share this important detail with anyone, he is attacked from the back seat of his car and strangled to death by an unseen assailant.Meanwhile, Jane sits at her kitchen table when a figure with an ax leaps through her window, hacking off one of her arms. She spews gallons of blood over the kitchen walls before falling to the floor, the killer continuing to hack at her until she is dead. Neal is revealed to be her killer. Upon learning the details of Berti\u0027s sadistic murder spree, Neal had suddenly been overwhelmed by a forgotten memory involving Neal\u0027s murder of a young woman (Eva Robbins) who had sexually humiliated him when he was a youth in Rhode Island. The memory now constantly torments him and has inflamed his previously repressed lust for blood. Neal has become completely insane. Berti was the killer of Tilde, Maria, and all the other women by razor, but it was Neal who killed Berti, along with Bullmer, Gianni and Jane.When Inspector Altieri arrives at the house a few minutes after Jane\u0027s death, Neal kills her too. Later, Giermani and Anne arrive at the house in the pouring rain, and when Neal sees that he cannot escape, he commits bloody suicide in front of them by slashing his neck with a straight razor. Anne runs outside to her car for a moment. Giermani relaxes and is suddenly murdered by Neal, who had faked his own death. Neal waits inside for Anne to return, but when she opens the door and just at Neal is about to kill her too with the ax, she accidentally knocks over a metal sculpture that impales and kills the demented writer.

Shortly after defeating the evil entity known as Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard), the Losers Club - Bill Denbrough (Jaeden Martell), Ben Hanscom (Jeremy Ray Taylor), Beverly Marsh (Sophia Lillis), Richie Tozier (Finn Wolfhard), Eddie Kaspbrak (Jack Dylan Grazer), Stanley Uris (Wyatt Olef), and Mike Hanlon (Chosen Jacobs) - gather as Bev tells the boys about the vision she saw of all of them as adults when she faced Pennywise. The Losers make a blood pact to return to Derry in the event that they must face IT once more.27 years later in 2016, a gay couple - Adrian Mellon (Xavier Dolan) and Don Hagarty (Taylor Frey) - are enjoying a night out at the carnival when they are harassed by homophobic thugs. Even as they walk away from the carnival, the thugs follow them and start to viciously assault them. They throw Adrian over the bridge and flee into the night. Adrian almost drowns until he is pulled out of the water... except the one who pulled him out was Pennywise. Don watches in horror as the monster clown grabs Adrian and takes a huge bite out of his chest. Mike (now played by Isiah Mustafa) overhears a report of the incident over a police scanner, and when he arrives at the scene, he discovers the message \"COME HOME\" written in blood on the side of the bridge. Mike knows that IT has returned.We catch up with the other Losers in adulthood. Bill (now played by James McAvoy) is married to Audra (Jess Weixler) and has found success as an author/screenwriter, but he is frequently told that his endings are not good. Eddie (now played by James Ransone) is a risk assessor who is married to a woman, Myra (Mollie Atkinson), who is just as controlling as his own mother. Ben (now played by Jay Ryan) has slimmed down and is a successful architect, though he lives alone. Richie (now played by Bill Hader) is a stand-up comedian. Stanley (now played by Andy Bean) is a partner in an accounting firm. Bev (now played by Jessica Chastain) is a fashion designer, married to the abusive Tom Rogan (Will Beinbrink). Mike calls everyone, and they do not immediately recognize his voice until he mentions he is from Derry. Everybody becomes slightly unnerved by the phone call, and Mike beckons them to return to Derry. Bev tells Tom that she will be returning to Derry to visit friends, but he is paranoid and thinks she is lying to him and is cheating on him since he heard Mike\u0027s name. Tom starts to hit Bev until she fights back and runs away from their home. The other guys start to make their way back to Derry. The only one who doesn\u0027t go is Stanley, as he commits suicide by slitting his wrists in the tub rather than facing the nightmare from his childhood again.A flashback shows that psychotic bully Henry Bowers (Nicholas Hamilton) survived being pushed down the well by Mike and had washed out of the sewers. When he returned home, police arrested him after they came across the body of Henry\u0027s father and deduced that he murdered him. Today, Henry (now played by Teach Grant) is in a mental institution and has become even more insane. He is visited by Pennywise in the form of a zombified Patrick Hockstetter (Owen Teague), who presents Henry with his old knife.The Losers meet at the Jade of the Orient restaurant and catch up after a long absence. They joke and reminisce, but also note Stanley\u0027s absence. They start to split fortune cookies, only to each get single word fortunes that they realize form a full message. Bev\u0027s fortune reads \"Stanley\", and put together, the fortunes read \"Guess Stanley Could Not Cut It\". The Losers know that Pennywise has found them. The fortune cookies then start to crack open and reveal hideous little spider-like creatures. The Losers bash at them on the table, which only makes them look crazy when others see them attacking a table. Outside the restaurant, Bev calls Stanley\u0027s wife. Before she can say what happened, Bev knows that Stanley was found in a bathtub, and the other guys figure what happened to him.Everyone gathers at the hotel where they are staying, and Mike confesses that this is the real reason he summoned everyone back to Derry. They ask Bev how she knew how Stanley died, and she says she has seen how they all die, as she was the only one who saw the Deadlights when Pennywise captured her. Bill goes back to Mike\u0027s house, where Mike drugs Bill\u0027s water to cause him to experience a trippy vision. Mike explains that in all the time he has stayed in Derry, he has studied the history of IT and learned from a Native American tribe of the Ritual of Chud, which can be performed to destroy IT once and for all. He produces a ritualistic piece of pottery with a depiction of the ritual. They bring it back to the other Losers, and Mike explains that they need to gather artifacts from their childhood and place it in the pottery so that they can destroy Pennywise.Somewhere else in Derry, we see a little girl named Victoria (Ryan Kiera Armstrong) at a football game with her mom. Victoria is lured away by a firefly, and she follows it under the bleachers until she meets Pennywise. He uses the same manipulative trick on her to make her think he is playful, and he appeals to her sympathy when he cries about not having friends, as Victoria is made fun of for a birthmark on her cheek. Pennywise promises to make it go away, only to end up devouring Victoria.The Losers go to an old clubhouse that Ben built for them over the summer they all became friends. There, they find an artifact for Stanley, which is a shower cap. A flashback shows them as kids with Stanley asking if they will all remain friends as adults. His friends assured him that they would be.The gang splits up as they head back to their homes in Derry. Bev goes to her old home and meets the elderly Mrs. Kersh (Joan Gregson). She invites Bev inside for tea and cookies as Bev looks around. She finds an old pack of cigarettes, as well as the poem that Ben wrote for her, although she still thinks it was written by Bill. As Bev sits with Mrs. Kersh, the old woman displays unusual behavior. Bev notices what looks like rotted flesh on Mrs. Kersh\u0027s chest. She mentions to Bev that her father joined the circus. Bev sees what looks like a human Pennywise in an old picture. Mrs. Kersh then asks Bev if she is \"daddy\u0027s little girl,\" as her father had called her. The old woman is then revealed to be Pennywise as she takes on a grotesque and monstrous form that chases Bev out. Before Bev gets away, she sees Pennywise in his human form as \"Bob Gray\", who wears his clown makeup and scratches the red lines on his face to taunt Bev.Richie goes to an old arcade he went to as a kid where he picks up a token as his artifact. In a flashback, he is seen playing a game with Henry\u0027s cousin, and the bully teases Richie for being a \"fairy\". Adult Richie is then found and tormented by Pennywise, who claims to know his \"dirty little secret.\" He takes on the form of a Paul Bunyan statue and tries to attack Richie, but he gets away in time.Bill goes to an antique shop and sees that his old bike is on sale. He asks the shop owner (played by none other than Stephen King) if he can buy the bike. The owner knows of Bill\u0027s work, but agrees that his endings suck. Bill gets the bike and rides around his old street, passing the sewer where Georgie (Jackson Robert Scott) was taken. Pennywise taunts Bill with an apparition of Georgie calling to him from the sewers. Bill is almost lured in by the monster clown. As he rides away, he sees a kid named Dean (Luke Roessler), whom the gang had seen at the restaurant because he is a fan of Richie\u0027s stand-up. Dean has also seen Pennywise lately after Bill had mentioned it. He firmly orders Dean to get himself and his family out of Derry as soon as possible.Ben gets an old yearbook page, in which Bev was the only one to write for him. He is haunted by a flashback to his childhood where Pennywise took on Bev\u0027s form to ridicule Ben for his weight, as Pennywise knew that Ben loved Bev, and he still harbors feelings for her to this day. Her form\u0027s head took fire as Ben hid in a locker, only for Pennywise to be in there with him.Eddie goes to the pharmacy where he would pick up his medications. Creepy Mr. Keene (Joe Bostick) and Gretta (Juno Rinaldi) still work there. Eddie gets an inhaler before he is haunted by Pennywise in the form of his mother being attacked by the Leper (Javier Botet).Henry kills a guard and escapes the institution. He finds the Losers and attacks Eddie by stabbing him in the cheek. He manages to pull the knife out and stab Henry in the chest, albeit non-fatally, and he runs to his friends for help. However, Henry gets away again before he is caught.In another Pennywise haunting, Bill sees the message \"The fun is just beginning\" written, which is what Dean said to Richie at the restaurant, itself a line from Richie\u0027s stand-up. Bill knows that Pennywise is referring to Dean, and he goes to a carnival to try and save the boy after learning he will be there. Bill follows Dean into a hall of mirrors, but Dean just thinks Bill is a crazy weirdo. The two are then found by Pennywise, who bares his long tongue and razor-sharp teeth. Bill desperately tries to kick the glass out to save Dean, but Pennywise breaks through first and brutally attacks the boy, blocking Bill\u0027s view. Bill can only watch in horror as he fails to save the boy.Mike is in the library where Henry finds him and attacks him. Not long after, Richie comes and kills Henry by stabbing him in the back of the head. This causes Richie to puke.Bill reunites with his friends and vows to kill IT himself. His friends gather their artifacts and they join him at the Neibolt House to face off the evil entity for the last time. While there, they make it into Pennywise\u0027s lair and use the pottery to begin the ritual. The Losers throw in their artifacts, being Bev\u0027s poem, Ben\u0027s yearbook page, Richie\u0027s token, Eddie\u0027s inhaler, the boat that Bill helped make with Georgie, and a rock that Mike recovered from their rock war with the Bowers gang. The Deadlights appear and sink into the pottery with the artifacts, but just when it seems that things worked, out rises a red balloon that produces Pennywise. He faces the Losers again in his true form, as a monstrous spider that still carries his clown face, and he states how he has waited so long to see them again. Mike then reveals that the ritual never worked, and the tribe that attempted it on Pennywise got killed themselves. He splits the Losers up with more nightmare visions, including one of Stanley\u0027s severed head as a spider.Eddie and Richie find themselves in a similar scenario to when they were kids as Pennywise places three doors with \"Scary\", \"Very Scary\", and \"Not Scary At All\" for them to walk through. They see the severed half of Betty Ripsom\u0027s body, as well as a small Pomeranian that morphs into a monster. Meanwhile, Ben and Bev are trapped and split from each other, and Pennywise tries to kill Ben by having him sink into the earth while Bev is trapped in an illusion of a bathroom stall where he is harassed by the forms of Mr. Keene, Gretta, Henry, and her own father. Bev fights back against the visions and manages to pull Ben out from sinking, and she realizes he is the one who wrote her the poem as he had recited it as he was almost dying.Bill is trapped in what looks like his childhood basement. He sees his young self talking to Georgie, as the image of the little boy blames Bill for lying on the day that he died, as Bill had pretended to be sick so he wouldn\u0027t go out to play with Georgie in the rain. This had haunted Bill for years, and Pennywise knew he blamed himself for it. Young Bill goes to his adult self with a nail gun, but Adult Bill forgives himself and shoots the apparition instead.The Losers get close enough to fight Pennywise, with Eddie managing to muster up the courage to strike Pennywise himself. As he runs to Richie, however, Pennywise impales Eddie with one of his talons. The Losers try to seek a way out of there, and they figure that since Pennywise is a spider, he can make himself small to try and go after them. They then quickly realize that the only way to make him small enough to defeat him is to force him to believe he is small. They begin to yell at Pennywise and call out all of his otherwise harmless forms before he starts to shrink and shrivel into a powerless shell of his former self. This allows the Losers to pull his heart out of his chest and crush it, destroying him for good. The lair begins to crumble and collapse around them. Richie tries to get Eddie out, but he is already dead. The Losers escape the house and watch as it collapses on itself.The remaining five head to the quarry where they all swam as children. They think about Eddie and how he would have hated it since it\u0027s so dirty. Richie then starts to cry for his fallen friend, and the others console him. As they continue to swim, Ben and Bev share a kiss. As they later walk home, they see their reflections on a window and see their childhood selves, including Eddie and Stanley. One last flashback shows the group as kids riding their bikes home.Later on, Bill has gone back to work with writing, and he feels his endings are getting better. He speaks on the phone to Mike, who is thinking about finally seeing the rest of the world. They tell one another that they love each other, and Mike mentions a letter that all the Losers have been getting. Bill finds his letter and sees that it\u0027s from Stanley, written before his suicide. We hear his voice reading the letter over a small montage of the other Losers in the present. Ben and Bev are now in a relationship, while Richie goes to a bridge where he carved his and Eddie\u0027s initials, revealing that he was in love with him. Stanley\u0027s letter states that he knew he could never be brave enough to face Pennywise again, so he removed himself from the equation to give his friends a chance to honor him, which would give them the strength to fight IT. He turned out to be right.The film concludes with Mike driving away and finally leaving Derry.","numvotes":"245218","primarytitle":"It Chapter Two"},"color":"rgb(92,73,83)","size":1.0},{"source":"Horror Only","target":"tt0454082","id":"7088","attributes":{"notes":"Disability motif","runtimeminutes":"95","sex of killer":"male","synopsis":"On a snowy winter night on Christmas Eve, in the Alpha Kappa Gamma sorority house, Lauren (Yan-Kay Crystal Lowe) is getting changed into her pajamas. In the next room Clair Crosby (Leela Savasta) is writing a Christmas card to her half-sister, Leigh (Kristen Cloke). Suddenly she hears something from her closet. She goes over to the closet door and looks inside. Nothing but clothes. She goes back to her card and sees that her fountain pen is missing. Suddenly a figure wraps a bag around her head. In the struggle, the figure stabs the pen into her eye.At a mental institution not far away, Billy Lenz (Robert Mann) is being served his Christmas dinner. He is locked away, rocking back and fourth in his rocking chair, safely in his cell that is decorated with Christmas lights. The orderly serving the food gets a scare from a volunteer dressed as Santa who is looking for the children\u0027s ward. Security guard J. Bailey (Ron Selmour) makes jokes to the orderly about Billy trying to escape every year. The orderly and Santa walk away, leaving the security guard alone in the hall. Billy opens the small window on his cell and places a present wrapped in newspaper on the ledge for the security guard. The security guard opens it to find nothing that interesting, except on the newspaper is written \"I\u0027ll be home for Christmas.\" The security guard looks into the cell to find it empty and Billy\u0027s chair rocking back and fourth. He quickly opens the cell and goes inside, to find a hole in the wall. He takes his flashlight and looks into the hole, as Billy comes from under the bed and stabs him in the neck with a candy cane. Billy leaves the cell and kills the man dressed as Santa. He steals his outfit, stuffs his body in a bag, and leaves the institution, dumping the bag in the dumpster with the man\u0027s hand sticking out from the bag.Outside of the sorority house, Kelli Presley (Katie Cassidy) and her boyfriend Kyle Autry (Oliver Hudson) are talking in his car. She tells him that she is going to spend Christmas with her roommates but that she will make it up to him. He is disappointed because this is their first Christmas together. She kisses him goodbye and goes inside the house. As she does her fellow sorority sister Megan Helms (Jessica Harmon) calls Kyle on his cell phone.

Kelli goes inside and greets everyone, including Melissa Kitt (Michelle Trachtenberg), her best friend. Heather Fitzgerald (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), Dana Mathis (Lacey Chabert), Lauren Hannon and Ms. MacHenry (Andrea Martin), the house mother who loves all of the girls and accepts their flaws.They have a \"secret Santa\" gift giving thing going and Ms. Mac wants to know who got Billy. According to her, Billy (Cainan Wiebe) killed his family here. When Billy was born, he has a liver disorder that makes his skin yellow. His father loves him regardless but his mother is disappointed and wants nothing to do with him. They live in the house that is now the sorority house. As Billy gets a bit older he is treated even worse by his mother, who has become an alcoholic. On Christmas, when he is five, his mother tells him Santa was shot down by the Russians. His father, however, tells him he has a present for him hidden in a stow-away space in Billy\u0027s closet. Billy goes into his room, which will become Eve\u0027s in the present day, and finds a telescope, making him briefly very happy. However his mother and father are not getting along very well, and his mom is having an affair. Moments after finding the telescope, Billy hears arguing and looks under the door to witness his father with a bag over his head and his head being bashed in with a hammer. Billy runs back to his room as his mother and her lover take the body outside and begin to bury it in the crawl space under the house. Billy is watching this and is discovered. His mother chases him into the attic and locks him in there.All of the girls are horrified by this story but Ms. Mac assures them it is all true. Heather says she was the one who drew Billy\u0027s name for secret Santa but she thought it was wrong to buy him a gift because he was a murderer and it was offensive to the birth of Jesus to make a mockery of gift giving. Heather starts to go upstairs to her room but runs into Eve Agnew (Kathleen Kole). Eve has been upstairs the whole time and is leaving to go visit her family. She gives Heather her secret Santa gift, a crystal statue of a unicorn. Heather is less than impressed and bids Eve farewell. Eve goes towards the door but Ms. Mac tells her she has a present for her. Before she can find it, Eve leaves, obviously disappointed by Heather\u0027s reaction.Kelli and Lauren go upstairs to tell Clair and Megan they are going to open the presents. Clair obviously doesn\u0027t answer. Lauren pounds on the door and says she is going to steal her presents if she doesn\u0027t get down here. Laughing, Kelli does this on Megan\u0027s door. Megan tells them to go away and she doesn\u0027t want to open presents. They leave and Megan hears a snow globe tune playing in the attic. She goes into the attic and asks if someone is playing a joke. She gets more then she bargained for when she finds Clair\u0027s body by the window in a rocking chair. Someone comes from behind and smashes the snow globe into her head. She falls onto the ground as a bag is put over her head. She fights back, but the figure rips out one of her eyes with their bare hand!The home phone rings, Melissa answers it and puts it on loud-speaker. The caller is making all sorts of weird noises. Lauren teases him, and the caller threatens to kill Lauren before hanging up. Heather says someone is obviously sick in the head and doesn\u0027t need to be provoked by Lauren. Melissa checks the caller ID and is surprised to see it\u0027s coming from Megan\u0027s cell. They assure themselves it\u0027s just a joke.They open their presents, with Ms. Mac getting some lingerie as a gag gift. Everyone laughs and Kelli goes back upstairs to check on the girls. Kyle suddenly pops out of Megan\u0027s room. Kelli screams and the other girls rush upstairs. Kyle apologizes and says he wanted to surprise her. Ms. Mac asks if Megan is in her room and Kyle says he doesn\u0027t know. Lauren asks him how he could have just been in her room and not know if she is in there. He explains that it\u0027s really dark in there. He makes a joke about Billy getting her. He then tells everyone another story about Billy\u0027s past.Billy was kept in the attic for many years. His mother and stepfather lived happily without him. Everything was wonderful except his mom couldn\u0027t get pregnant by his step-father, and was sexually frustrated by his inability to maintain an erection. On Christmas, when Billy was twelve, she crept into the attic and had sex with him, her own son! Nine months later she gave birth to a baby girl named Agnes (Dean Friss). She loves Agnes, and uses the occasion to further reject Billy, looking up to the attic where Billy is kept, and saying in reference to Agnes, \"She\u0027s my family now.\" Variants of this line are used repeatedly in the rest of the movie. As Agnes grew older, Billy became jealous. One Christmas, Agnes got a doll for a present. A jealous Billy releases a tantrum and breaks the attic door open and rushes to the living room, attacking Agnes and pulling out one of her eyes, stabbing his stepfather in the face and beating his mom to death with a dough roller. When the police arrive on the scene, they find him eating a cookie made from his mother\u0027s flesh. Agnes was put into an orphanage and no one knows where she is today.The girls are freaked out by the story. Kelli goes inside Megan\u0027s room and finds the porn video on the computer. She breaks down and Kyle tells her it was from a long time ago. Kelli screams for him to leave the house and he becomes enraged, calling the women \"spoilt bitches.\" Ms. Mac goes off on him about treating Kelli like that, pushing him towards the stairs. As Kyle leaves, a figure is standing by the tree looking at the presents. Ms. Mac asks who the person is. Clair\u0027s half-sister, Leigh tells the girls that Claire never called her, telling her she was ready to be picked up and she is worried. Dana says she even had no idea Clair had a sister. Leigh explains they are only half-sisters and are trying to get to know each other.Suddenly the power goes out in the house. Dana says the circuit breaker is under the house and she will go turn it on. She goes outside and smokes, dropping her cigarette into a hole on the porch. She hears someone underneath it. Taking her flashlight she opens the door to the crawl space and looks inside. Suddenly someone grabs her, pulling her in. The two struggle as the figure grabs a gardening tool and stabs Dana in the head. Lauren is beyond drunk now, having been drinking booze the whole night. Melissa tells her she smells and needs to shower. As she showers, someone watches from a broken tile in the floor. After the shower, Lauren goes to bed.Everyone starts asking where the other girls are, since Clair, Megan and Dana have disappeared. Kelli questions what is taking Dana so long, and is even more startled when someone calls from Dana\u0027s cell number and hangs up. The rest of the girls go outside to look for Dana. Heather and Leigh find Eve\u0027s car still parked outside. They open the car door and scream as Eve\u0027s severed head rolls out. The girls scream and run back into the house, locking the door behind them. Kelli calls the police but because of the snow it may take over two hours for them to arrive. Ms. Mac tells everyone that they can pile into her car and try to find help. Kelli says that they won\u0027t get far and that they need to stick together. Heather says she wants to leave, and Ms. Mac tells the girls that they can stay and she will go with Heather to find help. The two go outside and get in the car. Ms. Mac gets out of the car to scrape the ice off of the windshield. As she begins to scrape Billy\u0027s yellow eye comes into view inside the car. Ms. Mac gasps as he kills Heather, her blood spraying all over the windshield. Ms. Mac falls against the garage door, causing an icicle to fall from above which impales her head.Leigh notices that Ms. Mac hasn\u0027t left yet. She decides to go see what\u0027s going on. Kelli decides to go out with her, leaving Melissa and a sleeping Lauren behind. As they leave the house a figure grabs Heather\u0027s unicorn statue and walks down the hall. In the garage, Leigh slips on Ms. Mac\u0027s blood and screams. Upon hearing this Melissa rushes towards the stairs. A figure grabs wraps a bag over her head, slamming her into a wall. She rips the bag off and rushes through the house and into her room. She grabs a stick and hits the figure with it. Melissa opens a window and is going to climb out but the figure throws an ice-skate at her, cutting off the back of her head.Kelli and Leigh rush inside and call for Melissa. There is no answer and they go to Lauren\u0027s room, closing the door behind them. But someone is on the other side of the door and kicks it open. It\u0027s Kyle. Leigh attacks him and he throws her against Lauren\u0027s bed, causing the covers fall off of Lauren, who is very much dead with her eyes gouged out! Everyone screams and Kyle insists he isn\u0027t the killer. Kelli calls Lauren\u0027s cell phone and hears it ringing in the attic. She explains that the killer might be in the attic with her phone. Kyle opens the attic door and is pulled inside. Kelli and Leigh try to get into the attic but the door is slams shut. Kyle fights back as a bag is put over his head. Kelli breaks the door open and witnesses Kyle being stabbed with the unicorn statue, then one of his eyes being ripped out and eaten! Leigh attacks the figure and is thrown across the attic, discovering her half-sisters body still in the rocking chair. The figure attacks Kelli and Leigh tries to help but is knocked into a hole in the floor. A bag is put over Kelli\u0027s head but she grabs a fork and stabs the figure in the eye. She gets up and sees the figure has a glass eye. It\u0027s Agnes. Kelli tells Agnes everything is okay and she doesn\u0027t have to do this. She tells him her brother isn\u0027t here, he is still locked away. Agnes tells her that she doesn\u0027t have a brother, only a father. Billy comes from behind and lights a candle.Agnes attacks Kelli but is knocked into another hole in the floor that pins her between the walls! Billy pushes Kelli into the same hole, accidentally knocking over the candle. Kelli has grabbed onto a string of Christmas light attached to a small tree, trying to keep from falling completely in. She screams for help as Agnes starts to crawl up the hole. Leigh comes to her rescue, smashing open the wall. Agnes grabs Leigh\u0027s head but she manages to fight her off. Leigh runs through the house and smashes out another wall, finally reaching the spot where Kelli is trapped. Billy is climbing into the hole and Agnes is crawling up it! Leigh grabs Kelli and pulls her to safety as the Christmas tree catches fire (along with the rest of the attic) and falls into the hole, burning Agnes and Billy. The two survivors rush outside.At the hospital Kelli is going to have some tests done to make sure she is okay. Leigh has a present in her hand from Clair. She tells Kelli she wants to open it now because she won\u0027t be able to open it in front of her family. She says that she is glad she got to know Clair before all of this happened. She opens the present and finds a watch engraved with \"Family Forever.\" She starts to cry as a nurse comes in and tells Kelli they need her for some x-rays.Some time later Leigh goes back to Kelli room to see if she is back from the x-rays. A body with blonde hair lays in the bed, but as she approaches the person turns over to reveal Agnes. Leigh screams as Agnes grabs her by the throat and snaps her neck.Kelli comes back into the room and feels something is wrong. She finds Leigh\u0027s new watch. She sees blood on the ceiling above her and starts to leave the room, but Agnes grabs her from behind the curtain and starts to strangle her. Kelli grabs a defibrillator paddle and shocks Agnes in the head with it, killing her. This is the ending for the UK version. The US version continues from here when Billy comes down from the ceiling, as Kelli rushes from the room. She grabs some crutches that are in the hall and starts to beat him with it. She turns to run, thinking he is unconscious but he grabs her foot, causing her to fall over a medical cart. Billy grabs a scalpel from the pile of medical supplies now on the floor and takes chase. Kelli rushes to the stairs as Billy comes from behind, slashing her with the scalpel. She grabs him and throws him over the stairway, causing him to fall on top of the Christmas tree below, impaling him. His intestines spew out, he is very much dead, and Kelli is left to look on in shock as the credits start...","numvotes":"27084","primarytitle":"Black Christmas","productioncompany":"Dimension Films","countriesoforigin":"Canada, United States","averagerating":"4.6","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"Black Christmas","storyline":"In the 70\u0027s, the boy Billy is born with yellow skin due to a liver disease and his dysfunctional mother rejects him.

Dying from a mysteriously disfiguring ailment, Morlant entrusts his faithful manservant to bandage the jewel in his hand and warns him of dire consequences if his dying wishes aren\u0027t carried out.

A man in Egyptian fez and garb follows a suited man to his apartment building. The landlady lets the Egyptian in when he asks for a Mr. Dragore. In Dragore\u0027s room the Egyptian, Mahmoud, threatens Dragore (who is also Egyptian) with a knife. He demands a jewel, the Eternal Light. He wants to return it to the tomb from which it was stolen. Dragore says it is too late, he has sold it to a Professor Morant. They join forces to get it back.The next scene is at Professor Morlant\u0027s estate home, Eastvale. Morlant is on his death bed. He seems disfigured. A parson, Nigel Hartley, rings at the door but is abruptly turned away as he is told the professor is a pagan. The doctor comes out of the professor\u0027s bedroom after examining the professor and says to someone that he hasn\u0027t long to live and goes down stairs and talks to Morlant\u0027s solicitor, Mr. Broughton. Broughton sends the doctor across the hall to get a drink. Broughton looks in the professor\u0027s books and sees he paid 75,000 pounds for the Eternal Light, which leaves him little.Morlant asks for his manservant, Laing. He tells Laing that he wants the jewel buried with him as it will enable him to receive eternal life at the next full moon. Laing is against the idea but agrees. Morlant binds his hand with the jewel in his grip. Morlant also tells Laing to watch Broughton as he doesn\u0027t trust him. Later, Morlant dies. He is buried in a large mausoleum on the estate grounds. Someone is watching from the bushes but we can\u0027t see who. Laing removes the jewel from the professors hand and locks the tomb with the key left inside. Inside the house, Laing hides the jewel in a coffee container. He then looks up the address of a Miss Betty Morlant in the city. Miss Morlant, it turns out, is one of the professor\u0027s two heirs.Broughton leaves but tells his chauffeur, Davis, to stay behind outside and tail Laing if he leaves. Broughton seems to think Laing is going to steal the jewel. Laing now heads for \"Yoxford Station\" with Davis following.Back in the city at Broughton\u0027s office, the other heir, and Miss Morlant\u0027s cousin, Ralph Morlant learns that his uncle is almost penniless except for his house. Ralph decides to meet Betty and then go to Eastvale against Broughton\u0027s wishes.That night, Laing meets Betty in the street and hands her a note which she reads and then puts in her purse. The note says \"There is something of value at Eastvale and others are after it. Come quickly.\" Almost immediately the purse is stolen by Broughton (it\u0027s dark and she doesn\u0027t see who the thief was) and the note torn up, but the Aga has been loitering outside also, sees all this, and reads the torn up note.Inside, Ralph and Betty and Betty\u0027s friend Laney, who is sort of silly, decide to leave immediately for Eastvale.Back at the tomb we see someone planting explosives at the base of the door, and running a blasting cap under the foundations into the tomb. Broughton arrives at the house and begins looking for the jewel. Broughton answers the door and lets in Betty, Ralph, Laney, and the parson who has also wandered by. Aga Ben Dragore and Mahmoud also arrive. Mahmoud hides on the grounds with a knife and the Aga enters the house. The Aga wants to enter the tomb but is refused. Laney is quite taken with the Aga. Betty and Ralph, when alone, reconcile. Laing returns.Professor Morlant rises from the dead, sees the jewel has been stolen and staggers out, like a zombie, and begins his search for the jewel. He encounters Mahmoud and kills him.The Aga and Laney go to the kitchen to make coffee. They are interrupted by Laing who retrieves the jewel and hides it in Miss Betty\u0027s over-night case. The Aga goes outside and Laney gets scared and joins him. The professor encounters Laing and learns that Betty has the jewel. He strangles Laing into unconsciousness.Betty goes upstairs to her room with her case. The professor follows her and takes the jewel after a struggle. Looking inside a window, the Aga sees that the professor now has the jewel. Broughton and Ralph are arguing downstairs when Betty comes in and says what has happened and faints.The professor returns to the tomb with the jewel and Laing trails behind with the cousins. The Aga rids himself of Laney. In the tomb, the professor uses a knife to draw the sign of Anubis on his chest. He then places the jewel into the hand of the statue of Anubis and waits for something to happen. The cousins enter the tomb, without Laing who has refused to go with them. Anubis closes his hand to accept the jewel and the professor collapses, dead. But then the \"parson\" comes out from behind the statue with the jewel. He had placed his own hand inside the arm of Anubis. The \"parson\" Nigel Hartley points a pistol at Ralph but Ralph throws an object at him and knocks him unconscious. However the Aga now enters, also with a pistol and wants the jewel. He and Ralph fight and Ralph hurts the Aga\u0027s arm, but eventually the Aga shoots Ralph with a glancing blow to the head which knocks him unconscious. The Aga leaves, locking everyone inside the tomb, which now catches fire from one of the torches.Earlier, Ralph had called the professor\u0027s doctor and asked him to send the police. As they are driving toward the estate the doctor tells the police that he thinks Professor Morlant wasn\u0027t actually dead, that he had just suffered from an attack of catalepsy.The Aga runs into Laney and they argue and he slaps her. As he does so, the jewel falls out of his pocket, unknown to him, and Laney picks it up.The Aga runs out to a car but Broughton is in it and pulls a pistol on him and demands the Eternal Light. The Aga surrenders but then discovers he doesn\u0027t have it and they both see Laney has it. They chase her. She holds the jewel over a well and says that if they shoot her she\u0027ll drop the jewel in the well. They are stopped at first but then decide it might be okay if the jewel goes into the well as they can retrieve it. Just as they start to shoot her, the police arrive and disarm Broughton and Laney hands them the jewel.Back inside the tomb, just when everyone seems about to die, The fake parson, Nigel Hartley, comes to and detonates the explosives, which he had buried earlier which blows the door open.Ralph and Betty come staggering out of the tomb and kiss each other.The end.","numvotes":"2754","primarytitle":"The Ghoul"},"color":"rgb(82,77,74)","size":1.0},{"source":"Drama","target":"tt3622110","id":"6600","attributes":{"productioncompany":"Red \u0026 Black Films","countriesoforigin":"United Kingdom","averagerating":"5.1","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"Don\u0027t Knock Twice","sex of artist":"female","storyline":"The sculptor Jess unsuccessfully tries to retrieve the custody of her teenage daughter Chloe.

The thief tells him that he sold it to Professor Morlant, a fanatical Egyptologist who fervently believes in the pagan power of the ancient Egyptian gods. Dying from a mysteriously disfiguring ailment, Morlant entrusts his faithful manservant to bandage the jewel in his hand and warns him of dire consequences if his dying wishes aren\u0027t carried out. After his burial in an Egyptian-type tomb on his estate, an anonymous robber steals the precious stone from the corpse. Although the ghastly-looking dead man rises at the next full moon to seek revenge, neither he nor the audience know which member of the household possesses the powerful jewel. —duke1029@aol.com","startyear":"1933","runtimeminutes":"77","synopsis":"The opening scene is at night in a city. A man in Egyptian fez and garb follows a suited man to his apartment building. The landlady lets the Egyptian in when he asks for a Mr. Dragore. In Dragore\u0027s room the Egyptian, Mahmoud, threatens Dragore (who is also Egyptian) with a knife. He demands a jewel, the Eternal Light. He wants to return it to the tomb from which it was stolen. Dragore says it is too late, he has sold it to a Professor Morant. They join forces to get it back.The next scene is at Professor Morlant\u0027s estate home, Eastvale. Morlant is on his death bed. He seems disfigured. A parson, Nigel Hartley, rings at the door but is abruptly turned away as he is told the professor is a pagan. The doctor comes out of the professor\u0027s bedroom after examining the professor and says to someone that he hasn\u0027t long to live and goes down stairs and talks to Morlant\u0027s solicitor, Mr. Broughton. Broughton sends the doctor across the hall to get a drink. Broughton looks in the professor\u0027s books and sees he paid 75,000 pounds for the Eternal Light, which leaves him little.Morlant asks for his manservant, Laing. He tells Laing that he wants the jewel buried with him as it will enable him to receive eternal life at the next full moon. Laing is against the idea but agrees. Morlant binds his hand with the jewel in his grip. Morlant also tells Laing to watch Broughton as he doesn\u0027t trust him. Later, Morlant dies. He is buried in a large mausoleum on the estate grounds. Someone is watching from the bushes but we can\u0027t see who. Laing removes the jewel from the professors hand and locks the tomb with the key left inside. Inside the house, Laing hides the jewel in a coffee container. He then looks up the address of a Miss Betty Morlant in the city. Miss Morlant, it turns out, is one of the professor\u0027s two heirs.Broughton leaves but tells his chauffeur, Davis, to stay behind outside and tail Laing if he leaves. Broughton seems to think Laing is going to steal the jewel. Laing now heads for \"Yoxford Station\" with Davis following.Back in the city at Broughton\u0027s office, the other heir, and Miss Morlant\u0027s cousin, Ralph Morlant learns that his uncle is almost penniless except for his house. Ralph decides to meet Betty and then go to Eastvale against Broughton\u0027s wishes.That night, Laing meets Betty in the street and hands her a note which she reads and then puts in her purse. The note says \"There is something of value at Eastvale and others are after it. Come quickly.\" Almost immediately the purse is stolen by Broughton (it\u0027s dark and she doesn\u0027t see who the thief was) and the note torn up, but the Aga has been loitering outside also, sees all this, and reads the torn up note.Inside, Ralph and Betty and Betty\u0027s friend Laney, who is sort of silly, decide to leave immediately for Eastvale.Back at the tomb we see someone planting explosives at the base of the door, and running a blasting cap under the foundations into the tomb. Broughton arrives at the house and begins looking for the jewel. Broughton answers the door and lets in Betty, Ralph, Laney, and the parson who has also wandered by. Aga Ben Dragore and Mahmoud also arrive. Mahmoud hides on the grounds with a knife and the Aga enters the house. The Aga wants to enter the tomb but is refused. Laney is quite taken with the Aga. Betty and Ralph, when alone, reconcile. Laing returns.Professor Morlant rises from the dead, sees the jewel has been stolen and staggers out, like a zombie, and begins his search for the jewel. He encounters Mahmoud and kills him.The Aga and Laney go to the kitchen to make coffee. They are interrupted by Laing who retrieves the jewel and hides it in Miss Betty\u0027s over-night case. The Aga goes outside and Laney gets scared and joins him. The professor encounters Laing and learns that Betty has the jewel. He strangles Laing into unconsciousness.Betty goes upstairs to her room with her case. The professor follows her and takes the jewel after a struggle. Looking inside a window, the Aga sees that the professor now has the jewel. Broughton and Ralph are arguing downstairs when Betty comes in and says what has happened and faints.The professor returns to the tomb with the jewel and Laing trails behind with the cousins. The Aga rids himself of Laney. In the tomb, the professor uses a knife to draw the sign of Anubis on his chest. He then places the jewel into the hand of the statue of Anubis and waits for something to happen. The cousins enter the tomb, without Laing who has refused to go with them. Anubis closes his hand to accept the jewel and the professor collapses, dead. But then the \"parson\" comes out from behind the statue with the jewel. He had placed his own hand inside the arm of Anubis. The \"parson\" Nigel Hartley points a pistol at Ralph but Ralph throws an object at him and knocks him unconscious. However the Aga now enters, also with a pistol and wants the jewel. He and Ralph fight and Ralph hurts the Aga\u0027s arm, but eventually the Aga shoots Ralph with a glancing blow to the head which knocks him unconscious. The Aga leaves, locking everyone inside the tomb, which now catches fire from one of the torches.Earlier, Ralph had called the professor\u0027s doctor and asked him to send the police. As they are driving toward the estate the doctor tells the police that he thinks Professor Morlant wasn\u0027t actually dead, that he had just suffered from an attack of catalepsy.The Aga runs into Laney and they argue and he slaps her. As he does so, the jewel falls out of his pocket, unknown to him, and Laney picks it up.The Aga runs out to a car but Broughton is in it and pulls a pistol on him and demands the Eternal Light. The Aga surrenders but then discovers he doesn\u0027t have it and they both see Laney has it. They chase her. She holds the jewel over a well and says that if they shoot her she\u0027ll drop the jewel in the well. They are stopped at first but then decide it might be okay if the jewel goes into the well as they can retrieve it. Just as they start to shoot her, the police arrive and disarm Broughton and Laney hands them the jewel.Back inside the tomb, just when everyone seems about to die, The fake parson, Nigel Hartley, comes to and detonates the explosives, which he had buried earlier which blows the door open.Ralph and Betty come staggering out of the tomb and kiss each other.The end.","numvotes":"2754","primarytitle":"The Ghoul"},"color":"rgb(82,77,74)","size":1.0},{"source":"commercialism","target":"tt0024368","id":"7011","attributes":{"notes":"Museum as setting; disability","runtimeminutes":"77","sex of killer":"male","numvotes":"5615","primarytitle":"Mystery of the Wax Museum","productioncompany":"Warner Bros.","countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"6.8","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"Mystery of the Wax Museum","sex of artist":"male","storyline":"In London, sculptor Ivan Igor struggles in vain to prevent his partner Worth from burning his wax museum...and his \u0027children.\u0027 Years later, Igor starts a new museum in New York, but his maimed hands confine him to directing lesser artists.

As the package opens of its own accord, Billy begins to read and the delivery man reveals his true identity as the Creepshow Creep.\"Old Chief Wooden Head\"An elderly couple, named Ray and Martha Spruce (George Kennedy and Dorothy Lamour), living in a small Arizona silver mining town, oversee a general goods store with a cigar store Indian named \"Old Chief Wooden Head\" who adorns the front porch and are humbled to see their old, run-down town coming to a bitter end.The Spruces are then visited by a Native American elder named Benjamin Whitemoon (Frank Salsedo) from a local tribe who gives them turquoise jewellery, which are his tribe\u0027s sacred treasures, as collateral for the debt the tribe has incurred. The elder bids them farewell and returns to his tribe.When Spruces go back inside their store, the couple are then subject to a vicious robbery led by Benjamin\u0027s nephew, Sam (armed with a shotgun) and his two friends. After ransacking the store, Sam demands that Ray hand over the turquoise. Ray resists, and as a result, the Spruces are then shot and killed by Sam. The three thugs then leave in their car and begin preparations to run away to Hollywood, California. Old Chief Wooden Head then comes to life and goes out on a warpath to kill Sam and his friends and avenge the murdered Spruces.Old Chief Wooden Head brutally kills Sam\u0027s two friends. He attacks the first thug by shooting arrows through the first thug\u0027s trailer, killing him. The wooden Indian then kills the second one by hacking him apart in his garage. Then, the wooden Indian then corners Sam in his trailer. Sam, confronted by the living walking Indian, sees that he is unable to fight back as the shells from his shotgun have no effect on his wooden assailant. Sam attempts to lock himself in his bathroom but Old Chief Wooden Head breaks through the wall and scalps Sam alive as he screams in terror.The next morning, Benjamin Whitemoon wakes up in the morning he finds the bag containing the turquoise jewellery by his side. He visits the Spruce\u0027s general store to find Old Chief Wooden Head back on his pedestal, holding his nephew\u0027s scalp. Now aware of what has happened, Benjamin wishes the dead Spruces a peaceful afterlife as well as peace for Old Chief Wooden Head now that his revenge quest has been completed. Whitemoon then drives away.Animated Interlude #1Billy is seen at the town post office, receiving a package from when he sent a product ad from his copy of the Creepshow magazine. Incensed by the skeptical clerk\u0027s dismissal of paying $9.99 for a toy from the \"funny papers,\" Billy reveals that the package actually contains the bulb for a carnivorous Venus Flytrap. The clerk doubts the actuality of the package and Billy sets off for home.\"The Raft\"Four college students, Deke, Laverne, Randy, and Rachel decide to go swimming in a desolate lake far away from civilization. As they make their way to a wooden raft in the middle of the lake, they realize that they are being terrorized by floating black blob when it grabs a hold of Rachel and consumes her.The frightened students begin to panic and mourn the loss of Rachel. Deke then contemplates quickly swimming to shore so he can bring back help as he is a fast swimmer. But before he can carry out his plan, the blob seeps through the raft\u0027s cracks and pulls Deke through the raft, killing him in the process. Randy and Laverne manage to evade the creature long enough to where it gives up trying to grab them from under the raft as well.Randy and Laverne spend the entire night on the raft, afraid to fall asleep in fear that the creature will attack them while they sleep. They do manage to fall asleep and Randy is the first to wake up in the morning, relieved to find that Laverne and himself made it through the night. With Laverne still sleeping, he begins caressing her body and fondling her breasts. She soon awakes screaming in agony as the creature has seeped through the cracks and has a hold of her face, much to Randy\u0027s horror.As the oil-like blob pulls her off the raft and begins consuming her, Randy uses the opportunity to jump off the raft and swim to shore. He ultimately makes it, barely escaping the creature and yells \"I beat you!\" However, the oil creature rises up from the water like a wave and engulfs Randy.The oil blob returns to the lake, with no evidence of the four students even visiting the lake other than their car which was left running the whole time. The camera pans out to reveal a \"No Swimming\" sign barely visible from behind some growth.Animated Interlude #2On his way back home from the post office, Billy is ambushed by a gang of neighborhood bullies, who harass him and take his package from him. The gang\u0027s leader then opens the package, finding the Venus Flytrap bulb, and throws it on the ground, crushing it with his foot. In retaliation, Billy kicks the bully in the groin and flees, with the bully and his gang in hot pursuit.\"The Hitchhiker\"An adulterous businesswoman named Annie Lansing (Lois Chiles) gets up from bed after sleeping with her extramarital lover (who is a gigolo), realizing that she has to get home before her wealthy attorney husband to avoid suspicion. Annie hops into her Mercedes-Benz and makes way for home several miles away.On the way, she accidentally kills an innocent hitchhiker (Tom Wright) as a result of her speeding down the dark road, eager to beat her husband to the house. Seeing that no one witnessed the incident, Annie takes off without much thought. Shortly after Annie takes off, the area of the incident is crowded by passersby, with many reporting the hit-and-run to the police.Miles away from the scene, Annie stops along the road and begins thinking about what she has done and the consequences involved, but she ultimately concludes that no one has anything on her and thinks everything will be fine. Before she can continue, however, the hitchhiker she killed suddenly appears outside her window and utters \"Thanks for the ride, lady.\" (A line repeated by the hitchhiker throughout the story).The frightened Annie then speeds off in terror, but everywhere she goes, the hitchhiker always reappears and becomes her tormentor throughout the trip as she repeatedly runs him over, hurls off the top of her car, slams his body into trees, etc. as he only gets more and more battered and bloody without dying. Annie eventually loses control of her car in which she drives off the road and down a hill and into a tree, knocking herself out.She awakes a short while later, not seeing the hitchhiker anywhere in sight, believing it to be a bad dream. She gets back on the road and drives home, succeeding in getting there before her husband. As she begins to step out of her car, the hitchhiker appears from under her car, completely mangled from the trip, still uttering \"Thanks for the ride, lady,\" as he was made or programed to do by the forces of Hell. The hitchhiker begins attacking her as she vainly attempts to fight him off.Later, Annie\u0027s husband finally arrives home to find his wife\u0027s dead body in her car, dead from carbon monoxide poisoning caused from the still running car, with the hitchhiker\u0027s sign lying beside her showing his targeted destination (reading: DOVER).EpilogueStill being chased by the bullies, Billy leads his pursuers into a vacant lot swarming with out of control plant growth. As he rides into what seems to be a dead end, the bullies move in to pummel him only to learn that the bulb they smashed was not the first one Billy had ordered, as a quintet of Giant Flytraps emerge from the surrounding weeds and devour the thugs one by one. The spectacle is witnessed by the Creep himself, who cackles in glee as he drives off in his delivery truck to deliver the latest issue of Creepshow to another town.","numvotes":"24946","primarytitle":"Creepshow 2","productioncompany":"New World Pictures","countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"6.0","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"Creepshow 2","storyline":"\"Creepshow 2\" is divided into three stories, conducted by a leading segment where a boy that loves the horror comic book Creepshow buys seeds of carnivorous plant and is bullied by four teenagers.

Credits follow.A man on horseback approaches a prison in the mountains along a narrow pathway. A church bell chimes the hour as a man opens the gate for the rider. He is a priest (Alex Gallier). He is escorted by the Warder (Michael Mulcaster) to see Baron Victor Frankenstein (Peter Cushing). The warder explains that the prisoner is dangerous. The Baron wishes to see the priest because he thinks he can trust the man with his story. He starts his story, \"I suppose it was when I was a boy at school. I always had a brilliant intellect. When my mother died, I inherited the Frankenstein fortune.\"The Young Baron (Melvyn Hayes) is escorting his extended family out of his house after his mother died. His uncle (Raymond Ray) leads the family delegation. Aunt Sophie (Noel Hood) and her daughter, young Elizabeth (Sally Walsh) stay behind. Aunt Sophie wants reassurance her allowance will continue uninterrupted. After confirming the money will continue, Victor quickly escorts the two relatives out the door. As they are leaving, a dapper gentleman in a brown top hat arrives. Paul Krempe (Robert Urquhart) walks into the house and presents himself to the new, but very young, Baron. He had corresponded with the Baron for a tutor. Initially he thinks there must be some mistake or a joke, but Victor explains the tutoring is for himself and he is serious. The two hit it off immediately. After two years, \"I learned all he had to teach, but we went on together probing into the unknown, investigating, recording, searching, always searching until gradually the sweep of our research began to assume a single direction and to this aim we finally turned all our energies. It took us years of unrelenting work to discover what we were seeking.\" With chemical and electrical apparatus they were able to restore life to a dead puppy. Paul sees the possibilities of their discovery. He notes, \"If we could delay or prolong the period in which the body is apparently dead while the heart is alive wed have a living body with only the barest life-spark present. That what that would mean when it came to performing major surgery!\" Paul wants to write up their findings and present it at a medical conference within a month. Victor expresses his opposition because he wants to experiment further and does not want to share the secret, not yet at least. He proposes the next step. Rather than just restore life, he wants to create life from the beginning. He tells Paul, \"We must build up our own creature, and built it up from nothing. We must create a human beinga perfect human.\" Paul disagrees, \"What you\u0027re saying is nonsense, a revolt against nature. Such a thing could only end in evil.\" Victor persuades Paul to continue the work. He proposes to obtain a body, and knows a highwayman was hanged for his crimes and suggests they retrieve it. They take a horse and cart and cut down the body and return it to their lab. Paul notes that half the head has been eaten away. Victor quickly cuts the head off, explaining it is of no use. He dumps it into a vat of acid in the storage room next door. They remove the old clothes, wrap the body in bandages and place it in a large, glass tank. Now Paul voices his objection to the whole exercise, \"I don\u0027t think we should continue with this.\" Victor tells Paul he will be leaving for a while but does not explain where or why.Justine the maid (Valerie Gaunt) carries refreshments into the living room and asks Paul if the Baron has returned. She answers the door, expecting that Victor has returned. To her disappointment it is not the Baron but a woman who tells her she was expected and needs help with her luggage. Elizabeth (Hazel Court) is the Baron\u0027s cousin and we learn later his fiancée. She mistakes Paul for the Baron. Victor arrives home in an excited state calling for Paul. He is not surprised to see Elizabeth. He and Paul rush off to the lab upstairs leaving Elizabeth annoyed and confused.Victor unwraps something from a small black bag. He proudly displays two hands, cut off at the wrist. He explains they are Bardello\u0027s hands--the hands of the world\u0027s greatest sculptor. Paul voices his objection to exposing Elizabeth to the experiment. He tells Victor, \"While you were away, I decided I could not continue with this experiment.\" He tries to convince Victor to stop, but he is unsuccessful. Victor remains in the lab and will graft the new hands on by himself. Paul goes downstairs and tries to convince Elizabeth to leave. In this he is also unsuccessful, mainly because he will not explain the nature of the experiment or the danger. She explains she is to be Victor\u0027s wife.Outside the lab, Victor and Justine embrace and kiss. Victor is just toying with the maid. She believes she will be his wife, but Victor tells her that Elizabeth is to be his wife. The next morning Victor prepares to leave on another trip. Elizabeth talks to him about the household accounts and possibly assisting in other ways. Victor pays a visit to the Municipal Charnel House and buys a pair of human eyes. Victor takes them home to examine them when Paul asks to see him. He reiterates his refusal to help Victor with his work. Victor proudly shows Paul how far he has gone on his own. Paul turns away from the tank with revulsion and exclaims, \"It\u0027s horrible!\" Victor tells Paul that once a genius brain is obtained and installed the creature will take on a benevolent face. When asked where the brain will come from, Victor replies, \"I\u0027ll get it.\"Victor and Elizabeth are in the living room entertaining a visitor. Professor Bernstein (Paul Hardtmuth) accepted an invitation from the Baron for dinner and to spend the night. The professor tells Victor that discoveries can be mishandled. Paul enters the room and is introduced to the distinguished professor. Victor escorts the old man upstairs to his room. At the top of the stairs Victor shows him a painting, maneuvering the old man closer to the bannister, which gives way. Victor pushes the old man through and down to his death. Professor Bernstein is given a burial at the Baron\u0027s expense and in his family vault. Later that evening the Baron retrieves Bernstein\u0027s brain. He carefully places the jar in his bag and prepares to leave the vault. Paul arrives, expecting to find Victor and accuses him of murder. Paul intends to stop Victor from using the brain, and tells him so. They briefly struggle over the bag and the jar is broken.Paul calls on Elizabeth in her room and again begs her to leave. He explains he only stays to ensure her safety. In the lab, Victor is picking pieces of glass out of the brain, trying to salvage it. He puts the brain into the skull and prepares to revive his newly finished creature. He starts the chemical and electrical equipment as an electrical storm brews outside. Paul is upstairs in his room preparing for bed. As the tank empties, Victor goes to Paul\u0027s room and again asks for help. He admits, \"That apparatus was constructed for dual operation. You know that. I thought I could work it myself, but I can\u0027t.\" But Paul gleefully replies, \"I\u0027m delighted.\" A lightning bolt starts the electrical components and the body in the empty tank begins to breathe. Victor promises that after the experiment is completed he will dispose of the body. Paul reluctantly agrees to help. Victor returns to the lab and hears glass breaking. He unlocks the lab door and standing there is the creature. It pulls away the bandages covering its head to reveal a scarred and hideous face (Christopher Lee). One eye is blue, the other brown, and it stares at its creator with hate. It grabs Victor and chokes him. Only Paul\u0027s quick action saves Victor. He breaks a chair over the thing\u0027s head. The creature stumbles and falls to the floor. Paul demands the creature be destroyed as Victor straps it down to a table. Victor tells Paul he will operate on the brain the next morning and try to correct its homicidal tendencies. But the next morning the lab is a shambles and the window broken. The creature has broken free and escaped.Victor and Paul search the countryside for the creature. An old blind man (Fred Johnson) and his grandson (Claude Kingston) are out in the woods for a stroll. The old man sits and the grandson goes down to the lake shore to pick mushrooms. The creature encounters the old man. After a brief exchange he kills the old man. The grandson returns to where he left his grandfather. Victor and Paul find signs and follow it into the woods. They find it, and Paul shoots the creature through the eye. The creature falls and is pronounced dead. They bury it in place and return to the house.Paul goes to the lab and tells Victor he is leaving. With the creature dead, he no longer needs to stay and protect Elizabeth. But Paul doesn\u0027t know Victor dug his creation up and returned its lifeless body back to the lab. Victor stares at his creature hanging in the store room and promises, \"I\u0027ll give you life again.\" Victor is dressed and tells Justine she can serve dinner. Justine reminds Victor of his promise to marry her. Her trump card is the revelation she is pregnant with his child. He does not believe he is the father, but Justine informs the master that Elizabeth will believe her. She adds that she will go to the authorities regarding the experiment. He fires the maid and orders that she leave the next morning. That night Justine goes up to the lab to get the proof she will need for the authorities. Victor leaves the lab door unlocked and Justine enters for a look. She enters the storage room and finds the revived creature. When she tries to flee, Victor locks her in, knowing his homicidal creation will kill her. It does.A week later, Victor and Elizabeth are having breakfast. Elizabeth inquires about Justine. Victor lies and tells her, \"I expect some village lothario eloped with her.\" They discuss the wedding plans. Elizabeth reveals she invited Paul. Instead of being angry, Victor casually informs her he hopes Paul comes. He says that he has something to show Paul.It is the eve of the wedding, and a reception at the Baron\u0027s home is underway. The Burgomaster (Andrew Leigh) is enjoying the laced punch and practicing his speech. His wife (Ann Blake) reproaches her drunk husband and they leave for home. When all the guests have left, Victor announces he will be working in the lab. Elizabeth is disappointed and tells her future husband. Paul does not attend the reception, but does come later that evening. Elizabeth tells Paul to go surprise Victor. Victor is preparing a plate of flood when Paul knocks on the lab door. Victor invites his old tutor into the lab. He leads him to the storage room. Paul is shocked to discover the creature chained to the wall and showing signs of brain surgery. Victor orders the creature onto its feet. It struggles but stands, then sits when ordered. Paul chides the Baron about the creature\u0027s lack of perfection, but Victor reminds Paul, \"There you see the result of your handiwork as much as mine...but you damaged it. You put a bullet in the wretched thing. This is your fault, Paul.\" Paul exits the lab, promising to go to the authorities and have them destroy the creature. Victor chases after him. He leaves the lab door unlocked and Elizabeth enters the lab. The creature breaks its chains. Elizabeth enters the storage room and sees the vat of acid. The creature gets out onto the roof. Victor and Paul see it and Paul goes to the village for help. Elizabeth goes outside to explore a noise she heard. Victor grabs a pistol and goes out to the roof. Firing at the creature he hits Elizabeth, then the creature. Only wounded, the creature approaches Victor. A well-aimed toss of an oil lamp sets the creature ablaze. The creature falls through the skylight and straight into the acid filled vat below.We return to the prison, and the priest still listening to the story now finished. Victor concludes, \"My life\u0027s work destroyed. Destroyed in a moment. And by the same hand that gave it life.\" Paul comes to visit Victor at the prison. Elizabeth was only wounded and recovers. She is also at the prison, but stays in the waiting area. Victor begs Paul to tell the priest about the creature and to verify the story, but Paul denies it.

He is unaware that he is also being followed by his embittered ex-wife Jane (Veronica Lario).Immediately prior to Neals arrival in Rome, a beautiful young shoplifter (Ania Pieroni) is brutally razor-slashed to death by an unseen killer. The murderer sends Neal a letter informing him that his books have inspired him to go on a killing spree. Neal immediately contacts the police, who put Detective Giermani (Giuliano Gemma) in charge of the investigation, along with the detectives female partner Inspector Altieri (Carola Stagnaro).More killings occur. Tilde (Mirella D\u0027Angelo), a beautiful lesbian journalist, is murdered at her home along with her lover by the unseen killer who has a straight-razor blade.

Alone, Gianni watches in horror as an ax-carrying assailant brutally hacks Berti to death. But he is unable to see the murderer\u0027s face. Gianni finds Neal unconscious on the lawn outside the open front door, claiming to have been knocked out from behind.The next day, Giermani\u0027s investigation of the crime scene reveals that Berti was unhealthily obsessed with Neal\u0027s novels, and now that he is dead it is believed that the killings will cease. However, Bullmer, who is having an affair with Jane, is stabbed to death while waiting for his lover in a public square.That evening, Gianni is haunted by the thought that he had seen, but did not recognize, something important at Berti\u0027s house during the night of the interviewer\u0027s murder. He returns to the house and suddenly remembers what was so important: he had heard Berti confessing to his unseen attacker, \"I killed them all, I killed them all!\" Before Gianni can share this important detail with anyone, he is attacked from the back seat of his car and strangled to death by an unseen assailant.Meanwhile, Jane sits at her kitchen table when a figure with an ax leaps through her window, hacking off one of her arms. She spews gallons of blood over the kitchen walls before falling to the floor, the killer continuing to hack at her until she is dead. Neal is revealed to be her killer. Upon learning the details of Berti\u0027s sadistic murder spree, Neal had suddenly been overwhelmed by a forgotten memory involving Neal\u0027s murder of a young woman (Eva Robbins) who had sexually humiliated him when he was a youth in Rhode Island.

Later, Giermani and Anne arrive at the house in the pouring rain, and when Neal sees that he cannot escape, he commits bloody suicide in front of them by slashing his neck with a straight razor.

As a means of coping with these recurring nightmares and at the request of his girlfriend Lori (Anne Bobby), Boone is seeing psychotherapist Dr. Phillip K. Decker (David Cronenberg), who convinces Boone that he has committed a series of gruesome murders. In reality, Decker is a serial killer who dons a grotesque mask and has been murdering several families, all whom he sees as disgusting \"breeders\". Decker attempts to pin the blame for his killing spree on Boone. He gives Boone a bottle of lithium (actually a hallucinogenic substance) and twenty four hours to turn himself in. Boone wanders the streets in a hallucinogenic haze. He is hit by a truck and taken to a hospital.In the hospital, Boone overhears the drug-addled cries of Narcisse (Hugh Ross), who is waiting for the monsters to take him to Midian. Narcisse, led to believe Boone is a messenger from Midian sent to test him, tells Boone the way, before tearing the skin from his face with a pair of razors, in order to show his \"true face\". Boone escapes the hospital and makes his way to Midian, an entire city standing under a massive graveyard. Boone encounters two supernatural creatures named Kinski (Nicholas Vince) and Peloquin (Oliver Parker) who inhabit the city. Kinski says they should take him below but Peloquin states that whereas they are \"Nightbreed\", Boone is a \"natural\" and thinks he should die. Boone pleads with them, claiming he is a murderer and hence belongs with the monsters, but Peloquin says he can smell innocence. Peloquin transforms himself into a more monstrous state and bites Boone on the shoulder intending to devour him, but Boone manages to escape and leaves the graveyard, only to run into an entire squad of police officers waiting outside the gate with Decker. Decker tries to get Boone to surrender and suddenly yells that Boone has a gun. Boone is then gunned down by the police. At the morgue, Boone comes back to life due to Peloquin\u0027s bite becoming a Nightbreed. He makes his way back to Midian where Narcisse has also returned to. Boone is schooled in the laws of Midian and is inducted into Midian\u0027s society by Dirk Lylesburg (Doug Bradley), the leader of the Nightbreed. Lylesburg dips his hand into blood of Baphomet (the deity of Midian) and presses it to Boone\u0027s chest, completing his induction ceremony.Lori, seeking to understand why Boone left her, resolves to investigate Midian for herself. She befriends a woman named Sheryl Anne (Debora Weston) and drives out to the cemetery. She wanders into the cemetery, leaving Sheryl Anne waiting at the car. She finds a dying creature out in the sunlight and at the pleading request of a Nightbreed woman named Rachel (Catherine Chevalier), picks it up and takes it into the shadows, where it transforms into a little girl who happens to be Rachel\u0027s daughter Babette, who is sensitive to sunlight. Lori asks after Boone, only to be rebuffed by Lylesburg, who assures her that Boone is now Nightbreed, and hence no longer part of her world. Lori tries to make her way into Midian but is scared off by Peloquin. As she leaves the cemetery, she is greeted by the sight of Sheryl Anne\u0027s dead body and her new boyfriend, who reveals himself as Decker. He tries to kill Lori in an attempt to bring Boone out of hiding. Decker chases Lori back into the cemetery where he knocks Lori unconscious. Before he can kill her however, Boone appears. Decker stabs him only to learn that Boone cannot be killed due to his supernatural transformation. Decker manages to escape and Boone takes Lori into Midian, where she regains consciousness deep inside the city. Lori is told of the history of Midian by Rachel: the monsters of lore were peaceful beings, hunted to near extinction by frightened and superstitious humans. Boone and Lori are then banished from Midian by Lylesburg. Meanwhile, Decker interrogates a local mechanic who once wanted to join the Nightbreed and learns how they can die. He then murders the residents of the hotel where Boone and Lori are staying. Boone finds the murder scene. Unable to control his thirst for blood, Boone takes a taste. The police find him and take him into custody. At Decker\u0027s urging, the local police and militia led by a bloodthirsty police captain named Eigerman (Charles Haid) form up a small army to attack Midian. They release a drunken priest named Ashberry (Malcolm Smith) to serve them as God\u0027s servant in the battle. Lori, Rachel, and Narcisse race to the jail to release Boone. Lori shows Boone that she loves him even as a \"monster\". The four head back to Midian where Boone convinces the scared Nightbreed to fight back.During the battle, Ashberry is horrified to learn that there are women and children among the Nightbreed and tries to stop the attack, but is roughly beaten down by Eigerman. Ashberry then finds the statue of Baphomet. He drops his cross and Bible and moves forward to swear allegiance, but is splashed and severely burned by the blood of Baphomet and transformed. The Nightbreed manages to fight back, but Boone learns from Lylesburg that Baphomet is going to destroy all of Midian. He tells Lylesburg to release the Berserkers, a monstrous, feral breed that were imprisoned due to their sheer insanity. Lylesburg attempts to open the cages but is killed, leaving Boone to release them. The Beserkers attack the humans furiously, turning the tide of the battle as the humans flee in fear. Boone and Decker then face each other in the burning wreckage of Midian. The two fight and Boone kills him. Boone then goes to Baphomet (Bernard Henry), who says that he has caused the end of Midian, but also that this was foretold. Baphomet charges Boone with finding a new home for the Nightbreed and renames him \"Cabal.\" Boone makes his way out of Midian with Lori. The remaining Nightbreed meet in an old barn. Boone says his goodbyes to Narcisse promising that he will not forget the Nightbreed and that he will find a place where they will all be safe.Meanwhile in the ruins of Midian, Ashberry stands in front of Decker\u0027s corpse and states that he wants to exact vengeance on Baphomet and the Breed. He takes some of the blood of Baphomet and pushes it into Decker\u0027s chest wound. Decker suddenly springs back to life with a scream as Ashberry chants \"Hallelujah\" over and over again.Alternate endingIn an alternate ending (as used by The Cabal Cut of the movie), the Nightbreed await Boone in a barn whilst Boone says his goodbyes to Lori as he must venture the world to find a new home for them, but he promises to return to her. Lori, fearing she will be elderly when the time comes whilst Boone will retain his youth, stabs herself and dies. Boone is forced into resurrecting her into another Nightbreed. At first the revival doesn\u0027t seem to work, but it is eventually successful.Elsewhere, Captain Eigerman wanders the underground remains where he stumbles upon the transformed Ashberry who desires revenge. Eigerman shares this desire, but Ashberry rejects him and kills Eigerman and begins his hunt for the Nightbreed.","numvotes":"22535","primarytitle":"Nightbreed"},"color":"rgb(82,77,74)","size":1.0},{"source":"other","target":"tt1772770","id":"7077","attributes":{"productioncompany":"Wisdom Productions","countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"4.8","titletype":"movie","notes":"Anthology collection","originaltitle":"Book of 1000 Deaths","storyline":"Four stories that are more than just myths or fairy tales; these are urban legends with endings that are far from happy. \"The Clown Statue\" with Jasmine a college freshman struggling to make ends meet finds no fun in babysitting. \"Kidney Jacking\" where Misti an everyday nine to five office assistant has the worst Friday when she finds her boyfriend doing the unthinkable.

Bruyn meets his girlfriend Jezebel in a local bar and shares the news with her. A punk rock band plays the song \"What You Gunna Eat?\" in the background. He and his girlfriend Jezebel Buxton leave Brooklyn with another couple, Rod Ramington and Anatolia Grossentitten, to claim the ancestral inheritance.   They two couples arrive at the castle and are greeted by a freaky hooded caretaker named Rollo. He shows the couples to their separate rooms. When he is with Bruyn and Jezebel in their room, he begins to tell the group of the cannibalistic history of Bruyn\u0027s LeFevre Family.   Rollo\u0027s flashback story begins in 1664 outside of Kingston, NY. The French Huguenot settlers leave the Dutch city of Wiltwyck (present day Kingston, NY) to establish their own settlement in New Paltz, NY. They nearly starve to death that first winter and to survive they decide to eat the Esopus Indians who had tried to feed them. The cannibal legacy of the LeFevre Family begins. The Huguenots begin inbreeding and living in the woods because they have developed a liking for human flesh.   The tale continues as Rollo tells that British troops, who have taken the region from the Dutch, capture a band of the New Paltz cannibals and burn them at the stake the during the reign of Charles II in 1674.   Later, in 1789, the new American country tries to rid itself of the cannibal scourge. A band of inbred colonial cannibals is dispatched by guillotine.   Rollo\u0027s saga of inbred cannibal feasting then jumps to the Civil War in 1863. The incestuous cannibal offspring attack and devour a bagpiper playing \"John Brown\u0027s Body.\" A troop of union soldiers stumbles across the cannibal band and shoots them down like dogs with their musket volleys. His mad tale ends in peals of demented laughter.   Rollo leaves the room and the stunned couple begin to unpack and relax on the bed. Suddenly cannibal women climb out from under the bed and cannibal men enter through the door and devour the newly arrived couple from NYC. It is a scene of bloody orgy.   The other couple, Anatolia and Rod, are unaware of this development. Anatolia senses something horrible and begins searching the castle for Rod. She runs through the castle calling for Rod who can\u0027t be found. She runs outside looking for him there and rings a bell in warning. She runs to a small red wooden shed and opens the door. She sees Rod\u0027s eaten corpse inside and is grabbed by a laughing, machete- wielding cannibal and killed.   Three days later a nymph is eating a picnic in a field waiting for her lover to meet her. She goes swimming in a river and is surprised by the cannibal band. They chase her back to her picnic blanket and devour her. Meanwhile across town a young girl runs to fetch a priest. The demon has returned to re-possess her mother. The priest, Father Peter, performs a violent exorcism. To refresh himself afterwards he goes for a walk in the deep woods. Fr. Peter stumbles across the cannibal altar and a statue of their hideous god, Moloch. He realizes that a cannibal cult is in the area and he phones a priest friend to meet him with dynamite and guns to destroy the statue, the altar, and the inbred cannibal cult.   Meanwhile, Dixon Orchard is the home base of the cannibal cult. They ride motorcycles and chase down an unsuspecting duo of Clyde and Deke who are passing through the orchard. Deke and Clyde are trapped on a bridge by the cannibals. Deke has a gun, but is overwhelmed and eaten. Clyde jumps to his death from the bridge rather than be eaten by the cannibals.   The cannibals organize a large feast in celebration. They roast several victims and are singing songs, dancing, drinking, and eating human flesh. They begin chanting \"Moloch\" and worshiping their idol when the three priests arrive, Fr. Peter, Fr. Kevin, and Fr. Patrick, and begin shooting the cannibals with pistols. As most of the cannibals are shot down, one cannibal starts a chainsaw and attacks the priests. He too is gunned down. The wounded cannibals are all shot again. Then Fr. Patrick places a large charge of dynamite in the idol and they detonate it. The idol explodes and breaks into pieces on the ground. The demonic spirit of the idol emerges from it and dances in the night sky.   Afterward, a couple walks into a nearby Deli and realizes that the workers are slicing human limbs on the meat slicers. The cannibal deli workers then attack the unsuspecting couple and chase them from the store.

One of her guests is another Jesuit named Father Dyer (Rev. William O\u0027Malley), and Chris asks him about Karras, having noticed him and referring to him as \"intense\". She finds that Karras and Dyer are good friends. During the party, Regan appears happy and social, but she reappears after being sent to bed, dressed in her nightgown and urinates on the carpet in front of the guests while making an ominous statement to a prominent astronaut (\"You\u0027re gonna die up there\"). After the guests leave, Chris bathes Regan and puts her to bed, but is startled by a loud sound from Regan\u0027s bedroom. She rushes back down the hall and discovers Regan\u0027s bed shaking violently, rising up off the floor with Regan on it. Chris jumps on the bed and it still levitates.Chris subjects Regan to a series of medical tests to discover what the problem is. The doctors are unable to discover anything, despite putting Regan through some grueling, painful procedures. The best they can come up with is that Regan may have a lesion on her brain, but ultimately they are frustrated when nothing appears on her brain scan. At Chris\u0027s house, Regan suffers what appears to be a seizure, and two doctors visit to assist. They find her rising and falling up and down on the bed in a way that seems impossible for a human being. When they try to sedate her, she hurls them across the room with abnormal strength, speaking to them in what seems to be a male voice: \"Keep away! The sow is mine!\" Eventually they sedate her.Out of options, they advise Chris to search for a psychiatrist, but they also reluctantly discuss another possibility: they mention the phenomenon of demonic possession and the rite of exorcism. While they seem to hold professional contempt for it, they do admit that it has been known to solve problems such as what Regan is going through. Chris is skeptical, having no real religious affiliation of her own.The situation worsens when Chris is out one evening; she returns to find the house deserted except for Regan, who is alone in her bedroom and appears to be in deep sleep. The bedroom is freezing cold, the window standing wide open, and she is uncovered. Sharon returns and Chris is furious with her for leaving Regan unattended, but Sharon explains that she left Regan in the care of Burke, who was visiting the house, while she went to the pharmacy to get Regan\u0027s medication. Burke\u0027s absence is unexplained until the doorbell rings and an associate of Chris\u0027s breaks the news that Burke has just died on the steps outside Chris\u0027s house.Shortly after this, Chris is visited by a kindly detective named Kinderman (Lee J. Cobb), who seems suspicious of Burke\u0027s death. He questions Chris about the events of that evening, and Chris is nervous, hesitant to tell him about Regan\u0027s problem. While he is visiting, he notices a few small animal figures that Regan has crafted; they are similar in style to the desecration of the statue in the church. Kinderman leaves and immediately a violent disturbance comes from Regan\u0027s bedroom. Chris hears a deep male voice bellowing at Regan to \"do it\", and Regan screaming in protest. In the bedroom, Chris finds Regan plunging a crucifix violently into her vagina. When Chris tries to stop her, Regan assaults her with impossible strength, and furniture around the room starts to move on its own. As Chris watches in horror, her daughter\u0027s head turns completely around backwards, and she speaks to Chris in Burke\u0027s voice, saying to her \"Do you know what she did? Your cunting daughter??\" Chris then realizes that Regan is responsible for Burke\u0027s death.Desperate, Chris arranges to meet with Father Karras, and when she mentions the notion of exorcism, Karras is almost amused. He tells her that exorcism is nearly unheard of, and that he doesn\u0027t know anybody who has ever performed one. Chris is distraught and convinces him to meet with Regan anyway. Karras is shocked by the girl\u0027s appearance; she is tied to the headboard of her bed, her face misshapen and covered in lesions, her voice deep and gravelly. Regan announces that she\u0027s the devil, and toys with Karras in a number of ways, seeming to make a drawer next to the bed open all by itself, then speaking to Karras in a number of languages. She also conjures up the voice of a subway vagrant that Karras has encountered alone earlier. Karras remains unconvinced, and when Regan claims \"Your mother\u0027s in here with us\", Karras asks her what his mother\u0027s maiden name is. Unable to answer, Regan vomits spectacularly all over him.Chris cleans Karras\u0027s sweater and discusses Regan with him. Karras is still not convinced that Regan is possessed, especially because Regan says she\u0027s \"the devil\", and he recommends psychiatric care for her. Chris pleads with him to help her obtain an exorcism, swearing that the \"thing\" in the bed upstairs is not her daughter.While Karras thinks it over, he is approached by Kinderman, who questions him about the fact that the desecration of the church could be connected to Burke\u0027s death; what he was unable to tell Chris was that Burke\u0027s body was found with his head turned completely around backwards, and the police department considers it a homicide. Kinderman knows that Karras suspects something unusual about the McNeil house, but his confidentiality as a priest prevents him from discussing it with Kinderman.Karras visits Regan again and records their conversation, during which he sprinkles Regan with water. He tells her it is holy water and she begins to writhe in pain, seemingly going into a trance and speaking in a strange language. Later he tells Chris that it will be difficult to make a case with the Bishop for possession; the water he sprinkled on Regan was simply tap water, and was not blessed. The Bishop, and Karras himself, would consider Regan to be mentally ill and not possessed. Chris confides in Karras and tells him that Regan was the one who killed Burke Dennings. Later, Karras uses his tape recordings of Regan\u0027s seemingly incomprehensible babble to discover that she is really speaking backwards, in English. A phone call from Sharon interrupts him; she summons him to the house to see Regan, not wanting Chris to see that\u0027s happening: as they look at Regan\u0027s unconscious body, the words \"help me\" begin to materialize on her stomach, rising up in her skin like scar tissue.Karras reluctantly agrees to try and get an exorcism for Regan, although he seems to have more in common with the doctors who recommended it as a form of shock therapy. The church calls in Father Merrin to perform the exorcism, with Karras assisting. Merrin has performed exorcisms in the past, including a difficult one that \"nearly killed him\", according to the Bishop. When Merrin arrives at the McNeil house, Regan bellows his name from upstairs, as if she knows him, and she makes strange animal sounds. He warns Karras about conversing with the demon, and reminds him that the demon will mix lies with the truth to confuse and attack them.When they enter Regan\u0027s bedroom, she immediately begins with a string of obscenities. Merrin and Karras recite the ritual of exorcism and Regan manifests strange phenomena such as levitation, telekinesis, an abnormally long tongue, and strange vomiting. She constantly curses the priests and emits evil laughter and verbal abuse. Regan begins to talk to Karras in the voice of his mother, and he starts to break down. Merrin sends him away; when he returns, he finds Merrin dead on the floor, the victim of a heart attack. Regan cackles gleefully, infuriating Karras, who grabs her and shouts at the demon, \"Come into me! Take me!\" The transference works almost immediately; Karras begins to transform and Regan returns to her normal self. Before Karras can harm her, his \"normal\" personality breaks through for a split second and he commits suicide, hurling himself out Regan\u0027s window. Just as Burke did, he tumbles down the stairs outside Regan\u0027s window and lays dying in the street below. By chance, Father Dyer happens upon the scene and administers the last rites to his friend.In a brief epilogue, we see Chris and Regan as they prepare to leave the house in Georgetown. They are visited by Father Dyer. Chris speaks with him privately and tells him that Regan doesn\u0027t remember anything about the possession or the exorcism. Regan then appears and greets him cheerfully, transfixed by Father Dyer\u0027s white collar. Before they leave, she suddenly hugs Father Dyer and kisses him. As Chris pulls away in their car, she orders the driver to stop for a moment and gives Father Dyer the religious medallion that belonged to Father Karras; in their struggle, Regan had torn it from his body and it was in her bedroom all along.","numvotes":"387907","primarytitle":"The Exorcist"},"color":"rgb(93,99,84)","size":1.0},{"source":"icon","target":"tt0078767","id":"7161","attributes":{"productioncompany":"American International Pictures (AIP)","countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"6.2","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"The Amityville Horror","storyline":"Based on a true story that was claimed by writer Jay Anson, The Amityville Horror is about a large house on the coast of Long Island where newlyweds George and Kathy Lutz and their three children move into the house that they hope will be their dream house which ends up in terror.

A sign in front of the house gives its name as \"High Hopes.\"The film is based on the book of the same title, by Jay Anson, published in 1977. (Anson did not work extensively with the couple, but worked from hours of taped conversations between George and Kathy, which they had turned over to him.)The home features the Dutch gambrel (barn-shaped) roof design, and a pair of quarter-circle windows, on the end, on the 3rd floor, up near the roof. These are illuminated to look like the home\u0027s eyes. Filmmakers modified a house in New Jersey to look like the actual home in Amityville, and it is surprisingly close.It is a documented fact that a troubled young man, 28, had shot his entire family to death in the house, on 11/13/1974, including father, mother, two brothers and two sisters. Thus, in the film, the history of the house allows the Lutz\u0027s, in the fall of 1975, to make an offer of $80,000 on the home, which, we are told, is easily worth $120,000.Despite full disclosure of the home\u0027s past, by the realtor, the couple proceeds with the purchase, and moves in. George appears not to be strong of faith, but Kathy is at least a nominal Catholic. The couple turns to Father Delaney to bless the home. Father Delaney (Rod Steiger) encounters troubles in trying to bless the home, including a room full of flies, out of season, violent stomach sickness, and later, blisters on his palm when trying to make even a phone contact with Kathy at the home.In his further efforts to confront the evil, he suffers a car wreck from brake and steering malfunction, a lack of support by his superiors in the diocese as he describes the occult things he\u0027s seen, and ultimately, blindness and a mental breakdown.It is most moving when he, at the altar of the church, is praying, \"Give them strength of mind and body, that they may do Your will,\" and a high-mounted statue begins to crumble and drop dust down in the chancel area. Refusing to run, he continues the prayer at a scream, \"Oh, Lord, give them strength of mind and body, that they may do Your will!\" weeping at the seeming triumph of evil over good. After this, we are shown Father Delaney, sitting in an outdoor garden area, in a totally unresponsive state. Presubably, his mind is gone. George begins to be more sullen and angry over perceived cold in the house, and obsesses with splitting logs and keeping the fireplace stoked. One of the two boys suffers a crushed hand when a sash window falls on it, and the little girl has an imaginary friend, Jody, who seems to be of a malevolent nature. Mom, Kathy, catches a glimpse of two red, swine-like eyes, outside the daughter\u0027s 2nd story window. The family dog, Harry, a black labrador, obsesses over a secret room in the basement.George\u0027s land surveying business begins to suffer with his lack of attendance, and his partner is concerned. The business partner\u0027s wife, very sensitive to the paranormal, is at once both revulsed and intrigued by the things she feels when at the house. \"Boy are these vibes ever strong!\" she says at one point.The Lutz\u0027s witness a black, bubbling substance coming up in the toilets, an \"ooze\" coming down from nail holes in the walls, a babysitter being trapped in a closet despite its not having a locking doorknob, the disappearance of $1,500.00 cash, and Kathy\u0027s Aunt, a nun, running from the house and vomiting. Kathy observes George\u0027s persistant waking at 3:15 am, feeling he must go check on the boathouse, and other unsettling incidents. Kathy has nightmares in which she is given details about the killings of the home\u0027s prior family.Their research at the library and at the county records office suggest that the house is built atop a tribal burial ground, and that a known devil worshiper named Ketcham had once lived on the land.Finally, the paranormal events drive the family to flee the house one night, in the pouring rain, no longer even worried about their posessions.

The pillar is bought by the rich and spoiled J.P. Monroe (Kevin Bernhardt), owner of a popular nightclub called The Boiler Room. An ambitious young television reporter, Joey Summerskill (Terry Farrell), slowly begins to learn about Pinhead and the mysterious puzzle box. She is introduced to the pain the box can bring when she views a teenage club-goer being ripped apart by the box\u0027s chains in a hospital emergency room. She tracks the box and a young woman named Terri (Paula Marshall) to The Boiler Room, from which Terri had stolen the puzzle box.Through video tape interviews with Kirsty Cotton recovered from the Channard Institute, Joey and Terri learn about the demonic Cenobites and the power of the Lament Configuration, the only means of sending Pinhead back to Hell. Pinhead remains dormant until one night several hooked chains shoot out of the pillar and rip into one of the club goers, Brittany Virtue (Sharon Percival), Monroe had recently slept with. After killing her she is absorbed and her face appears on the pillar. Pinhead convinces Monroe to bring him club members so he can feed on their blood and be freed from the pillar.Now more dangerous than ever before, since he has been separated from his human self - a World War I British Army officer named Elliot Spencer who takes Joey on a walk round a trench filled with the corpses of what are presumably his men, explaining the nature of himself and Pinhead - and is simply the manifestation of Elliot\u0027s dark side and no longer under the control of Hell and purely out to cause chaos and destruction (in the previous movies the Cenobites were creatures of order, not chaos). Pinhead slaughters everybody in The Boiler Room, creating several new Cenobites in the process. Pinhead sets out to destroy the puzzle box so he need never return to Hell again. As time runs short, Joey must think of a plan to bring Pinhead and his newly-created Cenobites back to the realm of Pinhead\u0027s human self or else doom both herself and the mortal world to an eternity of pain and suffering.\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003dA young, rich club owner, JP Monroe, stops in an art dealer\u0027s shop. As he looks around he notices a large, plaster column with several relief sculptures on it, mostly of humans contorted in pain. Also on the column is a small sculpture of a puzzle box. The owner of the shop approaches him and sells the piece to JP, telling him to \"take pleasure in it.\"At a hospital emergency room, a young TV reporter, Joey Summerskill, is doing a piece on the abilities of the staff, however, the ER is strangely vacant that night. Suddenly, a man is wheeled inside the ER on a gurney. Sharp hooks at the ends of long, bloody chains are embedded in his flesh. As he passes Joey, the man whispers, \"Help me.\" A young woman follows after him, hysterically chattering about his condition. Joey interviews her briefly and the woman tells her that she \u0026 the man came from a club called The Boiler Room. When the doctors and nurses try to treat him, the chains are suddenly lifted by an unseen force, tearing at his flesh, and the man screams in pain. As the doctors and the young woman watch horrified, his head explodes. Before she leaves, the young lady retrieves a small puzzle box the man had been holding. She asks for the young woman\u0027s name and finds out it\u0027s Terri.Joey is ultimately bored with her job; she\u0027s only given puff pieces to report on. She also experiences nightmares about her father, who\u0027d died in the Vietnam War.She goes to the Boiler Room and asks about Terri, who turns out to be JP\u0027s former girlfriend. They tell her that she\u0027s out with JP at a restaurant. Joey finds JP there \u0026 gives him her card, asking to call if he sees Terri. JP tries to hit on her but she rebuffs him. Later, Joey wakes up from another nightmare and receives a phone call from Terri \u0026 invites Terri to her apartment. Terri shows Joey the puzzle box, which allows anyone who solves it to experience a strange realm of Hell. Terri concludes that the man who died in the ER must have stolen the puzzle box from the sculpture JP had recently bought.At the Boiler Room JP, a self-absorbed and cruel man, examines the sculpture he\u0027d bought. JP finds a hole in the column where the puzzle box had been. JP reaches into the hole and a rat bites him on the hand, drawing blood. JP\u0027s blood splatters across the column and is inexplicably absorbed into it. JP is fascinated. Later, while slyly watching the women who come to his club, he spots a lovely blond girl at the bar and has one of his employees give her a single rose, an invitation to meet with him privately. He lures the girl to his apartment, attached to the club, and has sex with her. As he does, the sculpture shows slight signs of animation. After he\u0027s finished with the woman, he harshly tells her to leave his apartment, having only wanted her for pleasure. Angry at being spurned, she begins to berate him for being such a cad when hooked chains emerge from the sculpture and snare her skin. She\u0027s forced to turn around and face the pillar. One of the faces, belonging to the Cenobite Pinhead, suddenly comes to life and hooks her forehead with another chain. Her skin is yanked from her body in a single jerk and as she screams, she\u0027s swallowed into the sculpture. JP is horrified but listens intently as Pinhead tells him he can grant JP all the pleasure, wealth and fame he seeks if he\u0027ll supply the statue with fresh blood and flesh. JP is unconvinced and shoots at Pinhead with a pistol; the shots are useless -- Pinhead spits the bullets out effortlessly. JP promises to bring what Pinhead asks for.Joey continues to be plagued by the nightmares about her father. She also continues her investigation into the young man who died in the ER and JP\u0027s club. Her efforts continue to be fruitless. She also receives news that she\u0027s been offered a job in another city -- since she and Terri had struck up a mild friendship, Terri is upset and leaves Joey\u0027s apartment after receiving a call from JP, who asks her to come back to him.At JP\u0027s apartment, JP tries to talk Terri into starting up their romance again. Terri is very reluctant but still starts to fall for JP\u0027s charms. As he talks to her, he walks her closer to the pillar, suddenly grabbing her and trying to force her even closer to it. Pinhead\u0027s face suddenly comes to life and growls and Terri retreats. When JP tries to grab her again, she hits him in the face with a set of brass knuckles. He falls on the floor unconscious. Just as Terri is about to leave the room, Pinhead stops her, demanding she give him JP\u0027s body. She pushes his limp body closer to the pillar and watches in horror as JP is hooked and yanked into the pillar. The sculpture explodes, tossing bits of flesh around and Pinhead emerges, free of his prison. Terri is too frightened to retreat.Joey has another nightmare about her father while he fights in a battle in Vietnam. This time, she\u0027s confronted by a young British man in an army uniform. He identifies himself as Captain Elliott Spencer, a World War II veteran, whom, after the war, had acquired the puzzle box in the Far East after the war and had discovered, while trying to solve it, that it was a doorway to an alternate world much like Hell, where wanderers can experience the extremes of pain and pleasure. Spencer had unlocked the doorway and had eventually become a demon of the netherworld, subjecting thousands of victims to extreme torture. He\u0027d also had several demon assistants who\u0027d themselves been victims of the puzzle box. Having been challenged previously by a young woman, Kirsty Cotton, who\u0027s own father had been a victim of her crooked uncle, Pinhead was banished and his accomplices were destroyed. Joey learns of the box\u0027s power by watching a videotaped interview with Kirsty taken from the Channard Institute, where she was held as a psychiatric patient.Spencer himself wants to regain his human form and asks Joey to help him. He wants her to, using the puzzle box, lure Pinhead into the spirit realm Spencer currently lives in so he can capture him and break his curse. Joey agrees.Back at the Boiler Room, Pinhead bursts into the club and begins to torture, mutilate and kill the club-goers. Joey sees a news report on the carnage and calls her cameraman, Doc, who tells her he\u0027ll meet her there. When Joey arrives, Pinhead has finished his rampage. Joey runs from the club, chased by Pinhead. In the streets, she sees an odd-looking man approaching her: Doc has been turned into a Cenobite with a camera embedded in his head where his right eye used to be. Escaping Doc and another Cenobite -- the DJ from JP\u0027s club, who makes use of compact discs as weapons -- she retreats into a church. A priest meets her and doesn\u0027t believe her fantastic story about \"demons.\" Pinhead suddenly bursts into the church, shattering its stained-glass windows and melting the priest\u0027s steel cross in his hand. Over the priest\u0027s loud protests, Pinhead tortures the priest, forcing him to eat entrails plucked from his chest.Joey taunts Pinhead with the box and flees the church. In a nearby construction site she meets two more Cenobites: the first is JP, who has two drilling devices thrust through his head. The other is Terri, who wields sharpened hook blades and has a cigarette jutting from her throat. They are about to torture her when Pinhead stops them, demanding Joey give up the box. The box activates and Joey is sent to Hell with the Cenobites. In the alternate dimension, Joey meets her father. He asks for the box to break the spell and reveals himself to be Pinhead in disguise. He prepares to torture and transform her into a Cenobite when Elliott Spencer appears and forcibly fuses himself with Pinhead. While Pinhead is distracted, Joey stabs him with the reconfigured box, destroying him and restoring Spencer\u0027s humanity. The box remains and Joey drops it into a foundation block of the construction site. She walks away, believing that the terror is over. The building is constructed; the lobby features an elaborate decor of the box itself.","numvotes":"30082","primarytitle":"Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth"},"color":"rgb(93,99,84)","size":2.0},{"source":"special connection","target":"tt11121174","id":"6557","attributes":{"productioncompany":"Make It Happen Films","countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"2.7","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"Beyond Paranormal","storyline":"Box Girl Lily an influencer wannabe will risk anything for fans including her boyfriend\u0027s sanity.

That night, a strong wind blows a bottle of water over onto the rock, which begins to bubble and smolder. The next day, the head of the geological office, Dave Miller, returns to town from a business trip and finds the office destroyed by a huge growth of black rock and Ben dead, in a rock-hard, apparently petrified state. Meanwhile, Dave\u0027s girl friend, schoolteacher Cathy Barrett, brings her students to the desert, where little Ginny Simpson pockets a piece of the black rock, later washing it in a basin outside her parents\u0027 farm. In town, Doctor Reynolds performs an autopsy on Ben, but when he cannot explain Ben\u0027s rigidity, he informs Dave and Police Chief Dan Corey that he is shipping the body to a specialist. Martin returns to the demolished office with Dave, and there recognizes the rock formations as resembling the piece of black rock Ben had been examining. Cathy joins them and, also recognizing the rock, races with the men to the Simpson farm. They find it in ruins under a pile of black rock, and Ginny\u0027s parents dead. The girl, however, is in a catatonic state, and they rush her to the care of specialist Dr. Steve Hendricks, at the California Medical Research Center. He soon reports that she is slowly turning to stone, and posits that her only hope of survival lies with identifying the black rock within the next eight hours. Dave brings the rock to his old professor, Arthur Flanders, who assumes that it is from a meteor. Together they visit the Simpson farm, where Arthur notices a discoloration in the ground and deduces that the rock is draining silicon from whatever it touches, including humans. They then go to the desert, where they trace fragments of the rock to a huge meteor. Fretting that the meteor contains billions of years worth of space secrets, which they have only hours to discover, Dave sends the new information to Steve, who prepares a synthetic silicon solution and injects it into Ginny. While a storm brews outside, Dave and Arthur continue to investigate what causes the rock to grow, and after a piece of rock falls into the sink and begins to bubble, they realize that water is the culprit. Noticing the rain, they drive to the desert, where the small pieces of rock are mixing with water to form huge monoliths that rise from the earth and then crash into hundreds of pieces, each becoming another monolith. They report their findings to Dan, who plans to evacuate the town, even though the weather bureau reports that the rain will soon stop. At the hospital, Ginny finally stirs, and Dave deduces that Steve\u0027s silicon solution can be used to control the rocks. Soon, however, more locals are rushed to hospital in the throes of the petrification process, and the rock continues to grow. With little time to announce their findings to the town, Dave and Dan turn to Martin to round up the paperboys and spread the word. The governor soon declares a state of emergency, and Dave and Arthur struggle to convert the formula to one that will retard the rock growth, failing until they realize that the key lies in the simple saline solution Steve used on Ginny. While casualties mount, Dave figures out a way to dynamite the local dam and flood the nearby salt flats, thus creating a large supply of salty water near the canyon edge. Knowing that they must halt the rock\u0027s growth at the canyon edge or lose all hope of survival, Dave ignores the governor\u0027s refusal to give permission to the risky project, and sets up dynamite stations around the dam. Arthur doubts that the water will be able to absorb enough salt for the plan to work, but Martin cites hopeful statistics he has learned from years of reporting on the salt flats, and the team is cheered by his certainty. With only minutes left until the monoliths reach the canyon edge, Dan orders the dynamite to be detonated, and the group watches in fear as the water flows over the monoliths. The plan at first seems to fail, but finally the rock growth slows, and Dan holds Cathy as the last huge formation crashes to a standstill.","numvotes":"3150","primarytitle":"The Monolith Monsters"},"color":"rgb(92,73,83)","size":1.0},{"source":"icon","target":"tt0145531","id":"7109","attributes":{"productioncompany":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM)","countriesoforigin":"United States, Mexico","averagerating":"6.2","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"Stigmata","storyline":"A priest from the Vatican is sent to Sao Paulo, Brazil to investigate the appearance of the face of the Virgin Mary on the side of a building.

He steps forward and observes a white statue of the Virgin Mary, with two streams of red tears flowing out of its eyes. As another priest greets him, you learn that the man is Father Andrew Kiernan, an investigator sent from the Vatican to determine the validity of divine occurrences. The priest explains to Father Kiernan that the tears began flowing when Father Almedia died; his body still on display in a coffin to the side of the statue. While Father Kiernan takes pictures and samples of the liquid, a small young boy steals the rosary wrapped around Father Almedia\u0027s hands in the coffin.In a local market, the boy sells the rosary to an older white woman, while a local stall vendor warns them that it isn\u0027t right to steal from the dead.In Pittsburg, Frankie Paige (Patricia Arquette) lives a fast and free lifestyle, working at a hair salon and partying with her friends at clubs. After a long night of partying, she wakes up to a phone call from her mother. Her mom was the lady at the Brazilian market, and had sent Frankie a package of trinkets and gifts from her travels - the rosary among the presents. Frankie gives the gifts a cursory look, and stares at the rosary after she hangs up the phone. While examining the rosary, she suddenly feels extremely nauseous and vomits.Meeting up with her friend before they head to work, they both consider the possibility that Frankie is pregnant. After a day at the salon, Frankie relaxes at home in a hot bath. Suddenly, a dove flies frantically around her apartment, and Frankie is suddenly thrown under the water in the bath, struggling with an unseen force. Flashes between nails being driving into a man\u0027s wrist, and wounds developing on Frankie\u0027s fill the screen.Her friend finds her at home in the bath with blood everywhere, and rushes her to the hospital. While a surgeon attempts to sew up the two wounds, she explains that they look like they were done by a single sharp object driven through her wrists. The staff believes they are self-inflicted, though Frankie denies it.Back in Rome, Father Kiernan comes back to give in his report about a Virgin Mary sighting in a wall in Brazil. He mentions the statue that he discovered, but is quickly directed to drop the subject by the head priest. Frustrated, the Father accepts the church\u0027s decision.Frankie and her friend are riding the subway home, when Frankie suddenly stands up from her seat to confront a priest at the end of the car. She asks the man if he is Andrew, and when he replies no, she swears, and suddenly the train runs wild. Passengers are thrown around the car, while Frankie is now being whipped on the back by an unseen force. Finding herself again at the hospital enduring rigorous tests, the doctors finally conclude that she may have a case of epilepsy. While leaving the hospital, the priest from the subway meets her in the waiting room, hands her his card, and says that when she is up to talking to him, he wants to ask her about \"stigmata.\"News of Frankie\u0027s \"attacks\" have made the papers, and the Vatican has decided to send Father Andrew Kiernan to Pittsburg, and investigate the occurrences. He is told to quiet the situation, and defuse any rumors of stigmata. Upon arrival, there is an instant connection between himself and Frankie. They have a coffee at the diner, while Father Andrew starts the interview. After Frankie explains that she isn\u0027t religious, and doesn\u0027t even believe in God, Father Andrew explains that what is happening cannot be stigmata, as it only afflicts the extremely devout. After showing the wounds on her wrist that still haven\u0027t healed, he looks confused, but still does not relent. Frankie storms out, frustrated that this glimmer of explanation and hope did not amount to anything.That night, Frankie meets her friend at their usual club. She is clearly distressed - feeling that God is doing this to her, and that she just wants everything to stop. After her friend tells her that she is losing it, Frankie storms off only to be halted by another attack - this time scratches and slashes on her forehead. Bloody and hurt, she runs from the club in the rain. She reaches her apartment door, and sees Father Andrew ringing her bell. He sees her, but Frankie runs. Father Andrew discovers her crouching on a car in an alleyway, scratching symbols into the paint with a broken bottle. He walks towards her, and Frankie stands up bellowing something in a foreign language in a man\u0027s voice. She collapses, and Father Andrew carries her into her apartment. Father Andrew calls his friend in Rome and replays the phrase Frankie yelled - the friend explains that it is an ancient dialect of Aramaic - the language of Jesus.","numvotes":"67832","primarytitle":"Stigmata"},"color":"rgb(93,99,84)","size":1.0},{"source":"comes to life","target":"tt3609388","id":"6611","attributes":{"countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"6.1","titletype":"short","originaltitle":"The Clown Statue","sex of artist":"male","storyline":"Based on the terrifying urban legend.

Barney (Rutanya Alda), the friendly waitress and cafeteria cook, is thrilled for Teddy and the team. Lynn and Teddy, among many other students, attend a party later that evening.At the party, the story of Dickie Cavanaugh circulates among freshman, who are unaware of his recent death; they are told that Cavanaugh murdered his girlfriend, Penny, in a jealous rage years ago and is locked away in the sanitarium. Meanwhile, Lynn becomes jealous over Teddy\u0027s apparent attraction to Dawn Sorenson (Suzanne Barnes), and later, misfit Mike Pryor (David Holbrook) gets into a fight with his girlfriend Sheila (Lauren-Marie Taylor). Later that night, Michael Benson, the school mascot, is murdered in his dorm room after arriving back from the party, and his bear mascot costume is stolen by his killer.The following day, Mike Pryor is questioned by campus security officer Jim MacVey (Hal Holbrook) over the fight with his girlfriend. MacVey\u0027s daughter Penny, he explains, was Dickie Cavanaugh\u0027s girlfriend and victim.

The DJ at the radio station begins receiving odd phone calls from the killer, who tallies his victims. The unseen killer also places calls to Officer MacVey, and claims to be Dickie Cavanaugh himself. Meanwhile, Sheila goes down to the pond to search for another item on the hunt, and runs into the killer dressed in the bear suit, whom she believes to Benson. After teasing him, she goes into a shed by the pond, where she is killed by the bear suit killer.While Lynn is searching for items on the scavenger hunt, Teddy has sex with Dawn at her house and then returns home.

The opening scene shows a native girl, Zuranda (Jean Davis) participating in a ritual and placed on a table. A voodoo doll is placed on her chest. A chicken is waved over her and placed on her stomach and killed. Participating in the ritual is Dr. Roland Gerard (Tom Conway). He draws a sample of her blood.In the doctor\u0027s hut, Bobo, the houseboy (Otis Greene) enters and opens the blinds. He startles Susan Gerard (Mary Ellen Kay), the doctor\u0027s wife. Susan tries to bribe Bobo to help her escape her husband, but he fears the doctor\u0027s wrath. The hut is like a prison with bars on all the windows. Outside sits a guard, Gander (Emmett E. Smith). When Susan gets too close to the bars she gets a little too close to Gander\u0027s spear and she retreats inside. The ritual continues with Dr. Gerard and Chaka, the Witch Doctor (Martin Wilkins).In a bar, Rick Brady (Lance Fuller) and Marilyn Blanchard (Marla English) wait to approach a potential business partner. The bartender, Marcel Chateau (Paul Dubov) assists them in their scheme. Marilyn cozies up to Harry West (Norman Willis) at his table. They know and dislike each other, but they agree to a business venture. Marilyn tells Harry she intends to marry Rick. Rick and Marilyn leave the table after exchanging a few more barbs with Harry. They walk back to the bar and annoy Marcel and have a drink. She tells Marcel she\u0027s going to Harry\u0027s room and to distract their \"business partner.\" Marcel tells Yvette, the singer (Giselle DArc) to keep Harry occupied with a song. Marcel helps himself to his own product. Rick and Marilyn rifle Harry\u0027s room. They are looking for a map of the location of a tribe that has enormous amounts of gold and jewels. Harry notices his \"business partners\" have left. For $5 Marcel sells Harry a gun. Harry is unaware his weapon doesn\u0027t work, but Marilyn does. Harry returns to his room to find Rick and Marilyn examining a gold statue studded with diamonds and rubies. Harry\u0027s gun malfunctions, but Marilyn\u0027s works fine and she uses it to kill Harry. They continue to search Harry\u0027s room. It seems Harry had made arrangements before his untimely death to secure the services of a guide to find the tribe and collect the gold and jewels. That much Rick and Marilyn know.At the ritual, the girl\u0027s feet change. She changes into some kind of blond hairy creature, but we don\u0027t get a very good look. The witch doctor tells Dr. Gerard the change is only temporary. Zuranda is the daughter of the priest in the next village, so the tribe is responsible for her safety. Gerard wants to take Zuranda with him, but Chaka objects. Gerard finally convinces Chaka to let her leave, but just about that time Zuranda changes back to a native girl. Gerard wants the change to be permanent.Marcel comes to Harry\u0027s room to tell Rick and Marilyn that Harry\u0027s funeral is over. For a percentage Marcel arranges such things. He informs Rick and Marilyn there is a considerable fee due and payable. They are waiting for the guide, and since it was arranged by mail, Rick will impersonate Harry. The guide, Ted Bronson (Mike Connors, credited at Touch Connors) arrives at the bar and meets Marilyn. He is suspicious of her motives, but he needs the money.The next day they plan their trip. The three start their trek through the jungle complete with bearers. They decide to make camp just outside the voodoo territory. Gerard has returned to his lab with Zuranda. She screams which upsets his wife back in the hut. Susan enters the lab, against standing orders. Before he can send Susan back to her room, he informs his wife, \"I\u0027m using her to create a new being, not man, not beast, but a combination of the best of each. When I\u0027m finished we\u0027ll take her back to the States with us. We\u0027ll shatter the very foundations of Science.\" Susans reply is terse, \"You\u0027re insane.\" Gerard reminds her if she tries to escape he\u0027ll kill her. Zuranda again transforms. She has claws like a panther. The creature (Paul Blaisdell) is directed telepathically to go to the village. It destroys a hut and chases the couple with the baby inside off into the jungle. But Zuranda has serious qualms about harming anyone, and transforms back into her human form.Resting in the camp, Marilyn asks Ted about voodoo. Marilyn is drawn to the drums and tells Ted she\u0027s going to the north country. Ted informs her it will be without him. The next day Gerard approaches the village and is stopped by the natives until Chaka intervenes. Chaka confronts Gerard with the evidence he made Zuranda attack her own village. Chaka wants her back and Gerard agrees. He is told she will never kill because it is not in her nature to do so. Gerard departs. Ted and Rick get into a fight over Rick\u0027s trying to shoot a native scout. Ted is victorious and takes Rick\u0027s rifle. But the native village now knows of the white man\u0027s presence. Gerard takes his wife down to the lab to see Zuranda. Susan thinks she\u0027s dead. But Gerard explains that she is between life and death--a state of pre-transformation. Gerard smears blood on a doll and then tells Zuranda to get up and walk around the room. Zuranda complies. He injects her with a substance that turns her skin into armor plating. Gerard fires a gun at Zuranda and the bullets bounce off. Even acid has no effect when poured on her leg. Susan accuses her husband of being crazy and gets a slap across the face for it.Ted confesses to Marilyn that he thought she was poison the minute they met, but took the job because he needed the money. He asks for a straight answer, what are they looking for? She makes him a bargain--a 50/50 deal. She wants gold and badly. He agrees to take her as far as Bandaleya. She pulls a gun on Ted and takes his gun. She informs Ted he\u0027s going with her and Rick.When Bobo tries to take a message from Susan to the party approaching he is killed by Gander. When Ted tries to escape, Marilyn ties him up. Rick leaves looking for the village. Gerard is looking for Ted, Rick, and Marilyn. He has Zuranda with him in her transformed state. Gerard finds the camp and directs Zuranda to kill, but she is unable and retreats and transforms back into human form. Gerard admits that Chaka was right, he can\u0027t make her kill. He sends her back to her village. Rick finds the markings on the native totem pole which confirms they have the correct village. Ricks accosts Zuranda. She screams and bites Rick. He hits her and kills her. He walks back to camp and wakes Marilyn. He tells her they\u0027ve found the village. Gerard and Chaka find Zuranda\u0027s body. Chaka informs Gerard, \"White man die for this.\" Gerard agrees, until Chaka informs him that all white men, \"You too.\" They go to the camp and capture Rick, Ted, and Marilyn. They want the one who killed Zuranda. Marilyn rats out Rick. The bite on his hand is the evidence. Chaka insists Rick be executed by a white man, so Marilyn shoots Rick twice killing him. Dr. Gerard cuts Ted loose and they agree to stay with Gerard for a few days until things calm down with the villagers. Of course, Gerard has plans. Marilyn tells Gerard, \"It\u0027s lucky meeting up with you. I\u0027ve got a hunch I can use you in my business.\" Smirking uncontrollably, Gerard slyly replies, \"I\u0027m almost positive that I can use you in mine.\" They go back to Gerard\u0027s hut. Gerard takes Marilyn on a tour of the lab. He surmises, correctly, that gold is Marilyn\u0027s real interest in the village. He tells her he will arrange to make her a priestess. \"Then you can have anything you\u0027d like.\" Susan is locked in her room, but she has a rifle. She leaves her room and Ted notices her. They talk and she returns to her room. Gander keeps Ted inside the hut.At the village, they prepare for another ritual. Gerard and Marilyn arrive. Gerard convinces Chaka to use Marilyn for the ritual. They return the next day, and Marilyn is dressed in native garb for the ritual. Gander falls asleep and Ted goes to the lab. He checks around then leaves to get Susan in her room. Gander wakes and goes outside. He hears Susan and Ted talking. He captures Ted. Chaka and Gerard work on Marilyn. She transforms into the monster. Chaka pulls a ritual knife on Gerard so he takes Marilyn back to his hut after she transforms back into human form. Gerard takes Gander away from guarding Ted for a little task. Unguarded, Ted goes to see Susan. He grabs a knife and departs. In the lab, Gerard preps Marilyn for her new role as his monster/slave. Ted bolts the hut with Gander in hot pursuit. Just before Susan can escape, Gerard arrives with his monster. Susan shoots it with no effect. The monster picks Susan up and takes her in the direction of the village. Ted manages to kill Gander. Gerard escorts his wife the final distance to Chaka as the white sacrifice Chaka demands.Ted finds traces of Susan at the hut and hears Susan\u0027s screams at the village. He is captured by natives and brought to the village to be added to the sacrifice pile. Susan and Ted are tied up by next to a volcanic steam vent. Gerard calls his monster to come get her gold. Gerard is led away to be tied up with Ted and Susan. Ted and Susan manage to slip their ropes and get away as the monster attacks the village. Gerard orders the monster to kill Chaka--He is thrown into the pit. The monster discovers that all the ritual vessels are made of clay, not gold. Gerard informs the monster that the only gold item was the idol that went into the pit with Chaka. The monster feels betrayed and chokes Gerard. The monster returns to human form, now Marilyn. She sees the golden idol near the pit and approaches it. She bends down to retrieve it and falls into the pit, screaming. Ted and Susan return to the lab and mix up a couple of molotov cocktails. They use them to scare the natives and escape.At the bar, Marcel and Yvette are rolling a drunk for his wallet. Yvette gets her cut. Ted and Susan arrive just in time for the bus to town. Marcel asks about Marilyn and Rick and is told they are dead. Marcel comments, \"Her friend perhaps is dead, but not Marilyn. I have a feeling that one still lives.\" We close at the pit/steam vent as the creature crawls out.","numvotes":"557","primarytitle":"Voodoo Woman"},"color":"rgb(119,86,100)","size":1.0},{"source":"Comedy","target":"tt0100740","id":"6684","attributes":{"productioncompany":"Paramount Pictures","countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"6.2","titletype":"movie","notes":"Anthology collection","originaltitle":"Tales from the Darkside: The Movie","storyline":"This is really three shorter movies, bound together by a fourth tale in which the other three stories are read.

The mummy attacks her, chasing her through the house, where she becomes lodged in the broken window of the front door. The mummy uses a large pair of scissors and slashes her back open, stuffing the wound with flowers from a vase.Andy goes to Lee and Susan\u0027s place and finds them both dead. Suspicious of Bellingham, he goes to Bellingham\u0027s apartment and find him there with the mummy. He knocks Bellingham unconscious and ties him up. When Bellingham comes to, Andy demands that he turn over the scroll. Bellingham refuses at first and then begins to recite the incantation to bring the mummy to life and attack Andy. Andy is able to defend himself quite easily with an electric carving knife, dismembering the mummy. Bellingham finally directs Andy to a scroll, which he burns in the fireplace, along with the mummy\u0027s limbs. Bellingham ultimately leaves the university. While he rides away in a cab, he chuckles to himself. The driver asks him what he\u0027s laughing about \u0026 Bellingham tells him that a person like Andy would never know the difference between one ancient scroll and another - the scroll he reads is the actual one from the mummy. He recites from it and rides off.

Timmy convinces her to let him tell another story and she listens to him read \"Cat From Hell.\"Halston, a high-priced assassin, arrives at an old mansion, having been summoned there by an old man in a wheelchair, Drogan. Drogan tells Halston that he has an unusual mark for him to dispatch: a black cat. The cat has supposedly killed Halston\u0027s sisters, Carolyn and Amanda. Both sisters had befriended the cat, feeding it and showing it affection over Drogan\u0027s objections that it was evil. Carolyn was killed when the cat, sitting on a staircase riser, tripped over it and fell to her death. Amanda had been killed when the cat laid on her face while she was asleep.Halston is skeptical. Drogan introduces him to the cat, which sits quietly in Halston\u0027s lap for a few minutes. When Halston smirks at the ease of such a lucrative job, he tries to strangle the cat. The cat slashes him with it\u0027s claws and escapes. Drogan tells Halston that his pharmaceutical company had tested a new medication on thousands of subjects, all of them cats. He now believes the cat has been sent to take revenge on him and his family.Drogan leaves the house, bidding Halston to kill the cat by the time he comes home and also suggesting he not get angry, which will cloud his ability to kill it. Drogan checks over his weapons and tries several methods of killing the cat, all of which fail. When the cat leaps at him and scratches his neck, Halston becomes furious. At one point he tricks the cat into approaching and eating from a dish of food - he uses a laser sighting scope to target the cat, fires his pistol and misses. Fully enraged, Halston chases the cat through the house. The cat, suddenly leaping on to and knocking Halston down, then forces itself into his mouth, crawls down his esophagus and roosts in his stomach.Just before the stroke of midnight, Drogan returns and finds Halston dead on the floor. The cat crawls out of Halston\u0027s body and leaps onto Drogan\u0027s lap. Drogan has a heart attack and dies.In Betty\u0027s kitchen, Betty herself is impatient with Timmy, who persuades her to listen to one final story from the book, \"Lover\u0027s Vow\".An out-of-work artist, Preston, is being told by his agent that he can\u0027t help him if he can\u0027t overcome his creator\u0027s block. The two leave the bar they\u0027d met at; in the alley outside, Preston\u0027s friend is attacked by a monstrous gargoyle, who decapitates the man with one slash of it\u0027s claws. Preston shrinks in terror, begging for his life. The gargoyle makes him promise that he\u0027ll never speak of what he saw or the creature that committed the murder. The gargoyle also slashes Preston\u0027s body as a reminder. Preston promises to keep his vow and the beast flies off.On his way home Preston meets a beautiful woman, Carola. Telling her that the neighborhood is dangerous, he takes her home with him. The two have sex together and fall in love, eventually marrying and having a boy and a girl. Preston also finds that his creativity has returned and he enjoys a successful period of production. However, he is still torn with guilt over the murder of his friend and occasionally draws pictures of the beast, which he is careful to keep from Carola and his children.By the time 10 years have passed since Preston witnessed the murder, he decides to tell Carola about the night he met her. He shows her a small sculpture of the gargoyle he\u0027d kept hidden. When Carola sees it, she lets out a mournful scream and begins to transform, saying that Preston had broken his promise - she, herself, is the gargoyle. Preston is shocked and horrified, even more so when their children begin to transform into gargoyles themselves. Carola tells him she\u0027s sorry and kills him. She gathers her children together and flies off, breaking through their skylight and settling on a high ledge of a nearby building. They turn to stone, staring mournfully down at Preston\u0027s body.Back in the witch\u0027s kitchen, Betty tells Timmy his time\u0027s up. She approaches him with a butcher knife and the keys to his cell and shackles. Timmy frantically tells her he has one more story to tell, one not from the book. Timmy throws some marbles in Betty\u0027s path and she slips on them, falling backwards on to the skewers she\u0027d set out. Timmy manages to reach the keys while Betty struggles in pain and he frees himself. He gives her a hard shove, sending her into her own oven, which he slams shut, roasting her alive. Timmy seizes the package of cookies Betty had been feeding him and breaks the \"fourth wall\" by asking the audience, \"Don\u0027t you just love happy endings?\"","numvotes":"16896","primarytitle":"Tales from the Darkside: The Movie"},"color":"rgb(117,90,85)","size":2.0},{"source":"Horror Only","target":"tt0073324","id":"7172","attributes":{"runtimeminutes":"88","sex of killer":"female","synopsis":"Ever since his father died, Frederic [Jean-Loup Philippe] has been unable to remember   anything about his childhood, even though his mother has told him all   about it. One night, while at a party, Frederic notices a photograph of   some castle ruins near a beach. They look familiar to him, and he recalls   an incident that happened 20 years ago, when he was 12. He was lost. It   was getting dark, and he went to the castle where he was invited in by a   young girl [Annie Briand] dressed all in white. He spent the night there and became   infatuated with her. To thank her for her kindness, Frederic placed a toy   on her steps before he left to go home.When Frederic tells his mother [Natalie Perrey] about the memory, she denies that it   ever happened, so Frederic pays a visit to the photographer to find out   where the photo was taken. The photographer tells him that she\u0027s been paid   not to reveal the location but later relents and tells him to meet her at   midnight at the aquarium and she will tell him then. To kill time,   Frederic goes to the cinema. As he watches the movie, he notices the girl   in white standing in the doorway. He follows her outside. She leads him   into a cemetery and down into a crypt where he finds four coffins. He   opens one of the coffins to find several bats inside.Unknowingly, Frederic has released four vampiresses. Frederic runs   outside where he meets a woman who claims to be the girl he met 20 years   ago in the ruins, even though she looks nothing like her. She leads him to   a room in an old abandoned building. When he asks her to identify the toy   that he left with her 20 years ago, she cannot, confirming Frederic\u0027s   suspicion that she is working for the same people that paid the   photographer to keep quiet. For some reason, they do not want him to find   the girl. Suddenly, the woman bolts from the room, locking the door behind   her. While the girl in white watches, two of the vampiresses unlock the   door and release Frederic.It is now midnight, and Frederic goes to the aquarium where he finds   that the photographer has been murdered. A man with a briefcase walks   past, and Frederic follows him into the Metro. When the man pulls a gun on   him, Frederic kicks the gun from his hand, pulls the cord to stop the   train, and runs away. The man follows, cornering Frederic on a balcony.   Meanwhile, the two vampires throw a switch that turns on myriad fountains,   which afford Frederic with cover, and he is able to escape.Frederic tells his mother about seeing the girl in white. She tries   to convince him that he is mad and, while Frederic is changing clothes,   she calls the hospital. When Frederic leaves the house, he is immediately   captured by two ambulance drivers and taken to the hospital where he is   placed in a straitjacket and told that he is going to receive electroshock   therapy. While pacing in his room, Frederic sees the girl in white. He   begs her to speak to him if she truly exists, and she mouths the words \"Je   t\u0027aime\". Then she disappears. Two nurses come to take Frederic to the   psychiatrist, but they turn out to be the two vampires. Instead, they   attack the psychiatrist, untie the straitjacket, and allow Frederick to   escape.While running down the street, Frederic sees a blind man selling   postcards of the ruins, so he buys one and learns that it is called   Sauveterre Castle. Certain that the girl in white is calling for his help,   Frederic catches the train to Sauveterre. It is just as he remembers it.   He even finds the toy that he left lying on the castle steps. He walks   through the castle looking for the girl. Eventually, he comes upon a room   where he finds books, dolls, toys, candles, a coffin, and a picture album   with his picture in it. Just as Frederic attempts to open the coffin, his   mother appears.She tells him the story of the girl in white. Her name is Jennifer,   and she\u0027s a vampire. Jennifer was imprisoned in Sauveterre Castle when she   was 16 in order to prevent the vampire curse from spreading. It was   Jennifer who killed Frederic\u0027s father. The corpses of the four vampires   freed by Frederic were moved to the abandoned vault in Paris. While three   men track down and stake the four vampires and build a bonfire to burn   their bodies, Frederic\u0027s mother sends him back into the castle with orders   to kill Jennifer and bring her head. But Frederic cannot do it and,   instead, brings the head of a statue which he tosses into the bonfire.After everyone leaves, Frederic returns to the castle and awakens   Jennifer. She tells him how she learned to project her sight and then her   spirit while she lay in her coffin waiting for Frederic to come. He allows   her to turn him into a vampire, and they both get into her coffin and let   the tide carry them out to sea.

After her sister gives her her mother\u0027s car, Nell orders her sister, brother-in-law, and nephew to leave. Once she\u0027s alone she finds an ad in the local newspaper asking for volunteers to take part in a study on insomnia at an old New England mansion, which Nell decides to join. Elsewhere we find Dr. Marrow (Liam Neeson) discussing with his assistant Mary over which volunteers he should use for his study, which he explains is actually an experiment on how people react to fear. Once Nell arrives at Hill House, she argues politely with Mr. Dudley the caretaker to let her in. After minutes of arguing she finally enters through the gates of Hill House where at the door she finds Mr. Dudley\u0027s wife Mrs. Dudley. As Nell makes her way to her room, it\u0027s clear that she\u0027s instantly drawn to the house. Moments later Theo (Catherine Zeta-Jones) arrives and gives Nell with an awkward homophobic reaction. After the two get to know each other a little better, they both go downstairs and explore, and find the carousel room, then they return to the main entrance and meet Luke (Owen Wilson) Dr. Marrow, and his two assistants Mary and Todd. Once they get to dinner they discuss insomnia issues and find out more about each other, and learn what they\u0027d be doing for the next few days. After dinner, Dr. Marrow leads his guests to a room to tell everyone the story of Hill House and how Hugh Crain had built it for his wife and wished desperately for children, which all died at birth. After Dr. Marrow tells the story his assistant Mary talks about how she can feel the evil everywhere and that there\u0027s more to the story. As she goes up to examine the piano one of the strings snaps and cuts her, causing her and Todd to leave for the remainder of the movie. As everyone gets ready for bed Dr. Marrow tells Luke about how Hugh Crain\u0027s wife had killed herself, in order to scare Luke. Once upstairs Luke occupies himself with a book and a candy dispenser, while Theo tries to get closer to Nell, and Nell reluctantly asks to go to bed. As Nell and Theo are in bed, Luke decides to wander around, and is met be Dr. Marrow, who decides to talk for a while. As everything calms down for the night Nell is startled by a screaming Theo, in response to a constant mysterious banging on the walls. Nell and Theo cower as Luke rushes to see what the screaming is, although he was unaware of any banging. The next morning everyone tries to talk things out, but Dr. Marrow assures everyone the coldness and noises were all due to the old plumbing. The next night as Nell is asleep the movie encounters it\u0027s first visual samples of paranormal activity, and Nell is encountered by ghostly figures taking forms through the bed sheets and curtains. As Nell and Luke are filling out papers for Dr. Marrows research, Luke confides in Nell that Dr. Marrow must be up to something and that he would get to the bottom of things. Luke soon wanders off talking about Theo leaving Nell alone, where she experiences more paranormal events. Everyone quickly rushes in to see what was wrong and finds Nell scared, and concerned over what was happening in the house. While Dr. Marrow and Luke looked around to see what might have startled Eleanor look comes to a frightening observation that the large portrait of Hugh Crain had been vandalized with blood reading, \"Welcome Home Eleanor.\" Eleanor is appalled at the writing and demands to know who did it, but no one confesses, leaving tension between the characters. The group soon makes their way to the green room where they find a large unstable spiral staircase, and a fountain containing a large statue of Hugh Craine, and some more statues of a women surrounded by 6 children. As another night comes we find Nell sleeping, but she is soon awakened by some more sounds. As she looks around she finds a trail of bloody foot prints leading her to a hidden library. In the library she finds logs of hundreds of children that Hugh Craine must have taken in to his house, finding that many of them had actually died working for Hugh Crain. She goes to tell Theo, but Theo doesn\u0027t believe what Nell tells her, and goes back to bed.  Once Eleanor is alone she starts to brush her hair, but when she stops her hair parts on it\u0027s own, and Eleanor is deeply frightened once more. The next morning Nell finds Dr. Marrow\u0027s studies, and learns what the experiment actually is. She also finds out that he\u0027s interpreting her behavior as delusional. In the statue garden Luke talks to Theo and seems to have also figured out what Dr. Marrow was doing, but when they encounter Nell, she expresses that it\u0027s not Dr. Marrow doing everything to the house, and that it\u0027s indeed ghosts. She then insists that home is where the heart is. When Nell looks up she sees Hugh Crain\u0027s wife hanging, but no one else sees it leading everyone to think even more that Eleanor is mentally unstable and should go home. Nell rushes to the library and finds pictures of Hugh Crain\u0027s wife whispering for her to check the fire place. In the fire place Nell finds a skeleton that comes to life causing Nell to run away, following the voices of children. She tries to go through a door but is punched by a hand that formed from the door and soon disappeared. Eleanor rushes to the rest of the group and concludes that Hugh Crain took children from the town to work at the mills then never let them go. As she tells this to Theo, Luke, and Dr. Marrow, they conclude that she\u0027s going crazy from emotional distress and fear.  As Theo tries talking to Dr. Marrow about her, she finds that they\u0027re in an experiment to study reactions to fear, and becomes furious at what the experiment had done to Nell. Once Nell\u0027s in bed and Theo finishes comforting her and leaves to bring her tea, the walls form the shape of a face, and everything starts falling apart around her. She runs out and looks in the mirror to see Mrs. Crain\u0027s face, and then runs away again to the carousel room. She\u0027s then extremely frightened and runs to the green room. Theo, Luke, and Dr. Marrow go searching for Nell and finally come to the green room to find Nell climbing the spiral stair case. Dr. Marrow goes to save her, but the stairway starts to unhinge, causing Dr. Marrow to desperately and quickly bring Nell to safety.

Wells is beaten up and robbed.Later Joan approaches Wells on his small boat. He is prepared to forgive and forget, she implies that he asked for it after trying to pick her up. At that moment they are threatened by King and his gang. Wells sets off on his boat and calls on Joan to join him which she does, defying her over-protective (and rather incestious) brother.After drifting out to sea, Joan decides to go back and confront King, who has previously locked her into a cupboard when she has come close to other men. King and his gang keep a watch-out for them.At night Wells and Joan return to a quiet part of the mainland and make love in a cliff top house surrounded by curious sculptures. Caught up and surrounded by the gang, the couple escape into a nearby military base where guards and dogs are soon in pursuit of them all.The house was rented by sculptress Freya Neilson (Viveca Lindfors) whose lover, Bernard (Alexander Knox), is a scientist who runs the base. He will not discuss his work, warning her that he \"might be condemning her to death\".Wells and Joan make their way down the cliff face. King goes after them. There they discover a network of caves and bunkers occupied by a small group of young boys and girls, aged about 11. Although well-dressed, cared-for and educated, it is clear that they do not know much about the outside world. The children\u0027s skin is also cold at the touch.In fact the children are confined to the bunker which is the underground part of the military base. The premises, which double as a schoolroom and living quarters, are filled with surveillance cameras. Access to the children is limited though they are occasionally visited by men in radiation suits. Bernard gives them lessons via a TV monitor, but dismisses some of their more searching questions, saying that they will learn the answers \"when the time comes\".The children do not even know much about where they are. One of them actually believes that they are in a spaceship and are to populate a distant planet.The children have a small hideout in a connecting cave where they keep pictures and mementoes of people they think are their parents. They believe that it is a safe and secret place but Bernard and his associates are well aware of it. Bernard, who is, in his own way, genuinely fond of the children, has allowed them this degree of privacy in spite of objections by the head of security Major Holland (Walter Gotell).Time passes and Wells, Joan and King feel increasingly unwell, but Wells and Joan have promised to help the children escape and pressure King into helping them. The children keep them fed by ably smuggling food pass the surveillance cameras into the hideout.Since security has been unable to find the intruders, Bernard tells the children via the TV monitor that he knows their secret and asks that they give up the grown-ups that they are hiding there. He reminds them of a rabbit they once acquired as a pet but which later died and warns them that the same might happen to their would-be rescuers. The children rebel and destroy the cameras.Men in radiation suits then enter the premises but are overpowered and even killed by Wells and King. Using a Geiger counter, Wells discovers that it is in fact the children themselves who are radioactive. Nevertheless he agrees to break them out. They escape the bunker and face the world, the Sun and flowers for the first time.But before they can take it all in, they are rounded up and, kicking and screaming, are taken back to the bunker by other men in radiation suits. Freya Neilson, the sculptress, witnesses the events.King drives off in a sports car accompanied by Henry (Kit Williams), one of the children. Weakened by the radioactivity, King orders Henry out of the car saying that he is \"poison\". Henry is then grabbed by pursuers and forcibly taken back to the bunker in a helicopter.Chased by another helicopter, King crashes his car into a river. Joan and Wells are allowed to leave on his boat, but the sickness catches up with them and the boat goes round and round in the sea monitored by a military helicopter, which will destroy the boat once its occupants are dead.Bernard\u0027s only real regret about the whole affair is that \"his\" children now know for sure that they are \"freaks\" and prisoners and will be more difficult to control. He explains to Neilson that they were radioactive from birth. The plan is to release them \"when the time comes\", i.e. the inevitable nuclear war.

Angel is sent by De la Guardia to hunt down Gris to get Cronos no matter the costs. —Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","startyear":"1993","runtimeminutes":"94","sex of killer":"male","synopsis":"\"In 1536, fleeing from the Inquisition, the alchemist Humberto Oganelli disembarked in Veracruz, Mexico. Appointed official watchmaker to the viceroy, Oganelli was determined to perfect an invention which would   provide him with the key to eternal life. He was to name it the Cronos device. Four hundred years later, one night in 1937, part of a wall in a building collapsed. Amongst the victims was a man of strange skin, the color of marble in moonlight, his chest mortally pierced. His last words: Sua tempore. This was the alchemist. The authorities located the residence of the dead man. What they found there was never fully revealed to the public. After a brief investigation, the mansion and its contents were sold at public auction. Never on any list or inventory was the Cronos device mentioned. As far as anyone knew, it never existed.\"What was not revealed to the public was that a human male was found hanging from his feet, his blood draining into a basin. Also unknown to the public, except for a dying millionaire named de la Guardia [Claudio Brook] who will stop at nothing to obtain it, the Cronos device had been hidden in the base of a statue of an archangel. De la Guardia had spent his life acquiring old statues of archangels, always in search of the hidden Cronos device... so far in vain... until the day that the archangel shows up in the antique shop of Jesus Gris [Frederico Luppi]. Jesus and his granddaughter find the device and, not knowing what it is, Jesus activates it. He is horrified as claws protrude from the orb, hold fast to his hand and proceed to dig into   his flesh.Meanwhile, de la Guardia (who lives in an antiseptic chamber) sends his nephew Angel [Ron Perlman] to buy the archangel. When the statue proves to be empty, however, Angel is forced to take strong measures. He kills Jesus. Fortunately, Jesus has come to realize that the Cronos device confers immortality, and he uses it. But there is a cost. He begins to crave human blood, and his flesh starts peeling off, exposing a strange layer of skin, the color of marble in moonlight. In the final confrontation between Jesus, de la Guardia, and Angel, Jesus emerges victorious. Still, he smashes the Cronos device and goes home to Aurora and his girlfriend... to die. [Original synopsis by bj_kuehl]___   A voice over (Jorge Martínez de Hoyos) tells the story of Humberto Oganelli (Mario Iván Martínez), an Alchimist who arrived to Veracruz in Mexico running away from the Inquisition. In 1937, a building collapsed, and a grey-skinned men was discovered. It was Oganellli, the inventor of the Cronos device. He is supposed to die at that moment, impalled onto an iron stick. Every together renmant of that building was auctioned, including the small statue of an angel.Years later, the angel appears at the antiquarian\u0027s shop. Somebody (Luis Rodríguez) enters to look at it but leaves without buying it. Jesús Gris (Federico Luppi) has bought it. He realises that the angel is hollow, because, through one of the eyes\u0027 empty plaster socket, several huge bus fall down to the floor. Jesús picks up a kind of oval machinery thingy; it\u0027s the Cronos watch, a golden watch in the shape of a metal scarab. His mute granddaughter, Aurora (Tamara Shanath) is with him when he finds it.Ángel de la Guardia (Ron Perlman) is told where the angel statue is. In his turn, he tells his uncle, a millionaire De la Guardia (Claudio Brook) the news. De la Guardia wants the angel statue at all costs. Ángel buys it for him.Jesús wants to keep the watch. He sets the machiney onto motion. At first, it looks safe, but then 6 cocroach-like legs protude from the watch and make a hole on his hand. He doesn\u0027t let Aurora to get near the thing. His girlfriend Mercedes (Margarita Isabel), a tango-dance teacher, tends to his wound. She takes out a kind of metal sting from his hand and gives him some stiches.At night, Jesús doesn\u0027t feel very well. He goes to drink some water to the fridge, but the thing which attracts him the most is the bright red meat. Jesús feels restless. He sets the watch in motion again. A fourth sting comes out of the back side of the watch. That morning, the sun is shining outside. Jesús draws the curtains. His face looks much longer, but he shaves and he tells his girlfriend that he looks much younger because he has saved his white-haired moustache.When Jesús arrives to the shop, it has been vandalised. He contronts Ángel. He is frustrated because the archangel statue was hollow... and empty. De la Guardia tells him about the history of the Cronos mechanism. He also admits that he\u0027s dying of his sickness, and no treatment has worked so far. Jesús doesn\u0027t want to lose the Cronos. Jesús leaves on a hurry by the rooftop trying to look for Aurora, as he suddenly realises she\u0027s in danger. Aurora has picked up the Cronos to play with it. When he finds Aurora, he realises that she is frightened and tries to hide from him, or maybe she\u0027s scared about him, in any case she stops playing with her toy teaset and hides away from him. He tries to calm her down. She has hidden the Cronos inside her teddy bear. Immediately, Jesús uses the Cronos again, this time on his chest.Jesús is still guessing at the nature of the Cronos, but he feels that it\u0027s doing him good. His chest wound now expels a kind of mucose, and his eyes feel weird. Mercedes insists on his leaving the bathroom and go with her to the New Year\u0027s Eve party. Mercedes wonders how anyone can change so fast in such a short period of time. They dance in love there at the party. Aurora goes with them, but the girl usually stays on her own, silent as always. During the party, a man (Javier Álvarez) gets hurt and starts bleeding profusely. Jesús can\u0027t refrain from following that man to the gent\u0027s. They make small talk, but Jesús can\u0027t stop himself from staring at the spilled blood. He gets down on the floor to lick a blood stain. Somebody kicks him while he\u0027s doing that, knocking him out. The countdown to the first day of the year is being celebrated by everybody else. Meanwhile, Jesús is pushed out of the place where the party takes place.When he wakes up, he\u0027s in a car with Ángel, who beats him up. Ángel won\u0027t stop seeking the Cronos. Jesús asks what they want it for. Ángel leaves Jesús unconscious. Ángel pushes the car down from a cliff with Jesús inside.A funeral technician called Tito (Daniel Giménez Cacho) is preparing Jesús\u0027 corpse for burial. He is told that he\u0027ll be cremated, so all his excellent artistic work will be useless. De la Guardia tells off his nephew because he couldn\u0027t get the scarab and probably Jesús is still alive. Ángel goes to the funeral home and tries to wake Jesús up by closing his nostrils. Ángel leaves him for dead. Tito prepares the crematorium to burn the coffin - but there are problems with the gas and the piping, as all the tubes and pipes are really old and they would need maintenance. The technician leaves the room for some seconds to solve the problem. He doesn\u0027t realise that the coffee is empty, he just closes it down again without thinking about it. Ángel appears with the funeral house director (Juan Carlos Colombo) to enquire about the body of Jesús. The technician shows him the empty coffin burning to ashes in the oven. Ángel smiles.It\u0027s freezing. It\u0027s night. Jesús walks dazed confused and with a grey wounded face. He stops by a rubbish bin and he sees printed his own orbituary. Jesús tries to phone Mercedes. When he finally speaks up, Mercedes hangs up. Jesús limps home. It\u0027s Christmas and decorations are on the streets and the main hall of his building. He is opened the door by Aurora, who offers a towel for him. Jesús uses the Cronos mechanism again.Daylight really hurts him, so he hides inside an old trunk. Aurora paints the trunk and keeps on playing. Jesús writes a long letter to Mercedes. Jesús\u0027 faces is worst still. Jesús comes back to De la Guardia\u0027s warehouse, and he realises that Aurora has followed him. He tries to scare her away. She finds the little book written by Humberto Oganelli. There are some pages missing, and De la Guardia says that he\u0027s eaten them. De la Guardia takes off some pieces of dangling skin from Jesús\u0027 face nows feels metalic. De la Guardia rings the bell for his son. Ángel is pissed off at being disturbed by his uncle. De la Guardia tells Jesús that he needs to artifact to keep himself alive, and that he also needs blood. Jesús shows the Cronos to him and asks for the exit. De la Guardia knighs him. He fights with Jesús, but Aurora hits De la Guardia with a long stick. Jesús wakes up. Ángel appears and he tries to talk to his uncle. Jesús drinks the blood from De la Guardia\u0027s body. Ángel gets off from the lift and finds his uncle dead. Jesús and Aurora have hidden away. Ángel laughs with joy as everything will become his. However, at that moment, De la Guardia asks him for help, but his nephew kills him, fed up of being kept waiting. Jesús and Aurora hit Ángel. They run across the rooftops. He tells her granddaughter to leave by doing down the façade\u0027s ladder. Ángel hits Jesús. His victim looks week and unable to defend himself: he can only crawl away from him. To end the matter, Jesús throws himself agains Ángel\u0027s body, making him fall to the floor. Aurora sets the mechanism onto motion. Inside the scarab, a huge bag gives Jesús life. Aurora caresses Jesús\u0027 deformed face. Jesús peels off his own skin. Aurora was a bit hurt, so she\u0027s broken her lip. She offers her blood to Jesús, who finally decides to reject it with a supreme effort. Jesús shouts \"NO!\", and he removes the Cronos from his chest. He uses a stone to break it into pieces. He repeats his own name over and over again.Jesús dies, being cried by his granddaughter Aurora.---written by KrystelClaire","numvotes":"29759","primarytitle":"Cronos"},"color":"rgb(76,80,97)","size":2.0},{"source":"body in art","target":"tt5053024","id":"6835","attributes":{"notes":"Comedy","runtimeminutes":"7","numvotes":"90","primarytitle":"Still","productioncompany":"Dark Matter Films","countriesoforigin":"United Kingdom","averagerating":"7.0","titletype":"short","originaltitle":"Still","sex of artist":"male","storyline":"Still is an award-winning dark zombie comedy about a living statue entertainer caught up in the middle of a zombie outbreak.

A solitary figure walks down the street holding an umbrella. We enter the Wax Museum with various tableaux of crimes of the past, and then enter the workshop where Prof. Henry Jarrod (Vincent Price) is working on a sculpture. His business partner, Matthew Burke (Roy Roberts) enters and walks partially upstairs when he is hailed by Jarrod. He tells Jarrod he\u0027s there to study the account books. They have a philosophical difference between their approaches to business. Jarrod proposes a buyout arrangement, and Burke either eager or desperate for the money agrees in principle. A potential investor is scheduled to see Jarrod that very evening.Bruce Allison (Phillip Tonge) and Sidney Wallace (Paul Cavanagh) arrive and are given a brief tour of the wax museum. Wallace is impressed, but Jarrod explains that he\u0027s never satisfied with certain aspects of the finished products. Wallace explains he\u0027s going to Egypt for three months, so no decision on investment can take place prior to his return. Allison and Wallace depart. Burke was eavesdropping from the upstairs room and heard everything. He is impatient for a financial settlement and proposes an insurance fire. The place is insured for $25,000--$12,500 each. Jarrod is horrified by the proposal, and opposes it categorically. Burke lights the Marie Antoinette wax figure\u0027s dress with a match. It starts a fire that Jarrod quickly extinguishes. Burke starts a few more fires, with Jarrod quickly working to save his wax figures. Burke and Jarrod fight, and at one point Jarrod is knocked out. Burke douses the workroom and display area with a flammable liquid and turns on the gas light spigots. He goes upstairs as the place begins to catch fire. He returns to the workroom and continues his fight with the now revived Jarrod. Jarrod works desperately with buckets of water to douse the fire, but it is a losing battle. He is knocked out again by Burke and left in the burning building. The gas ignites blowing out the front of the building. The police and fire departments respond.At a dance Burke is entertaining a young lady, Cathy Gray (Carolyn Jones). He tells Cathy he and Jarrod were friends and no trace of him was found after the fire. He confides to Cathy the insurance settled with a check this morning and he\u0027s already cashed it. Burke returns to his office, opens his safe and pulls out the money. Jarrod is there, horribly scarred from the fire wearing all black. He turns off the lights then attacks Burke with a rope. He takes the money, but before he can exit he hears the cleaning lady on the stairs. She continues down the stairs. Jarrod has something dramatic planned. He rigs a rope in the elevator, carries Burke to the elevator door, ties the loose end around Burke\u0027s neck and throws the body down the elevator shaft. The cleaning lady (Ruth Warren) screams when she discovers the dead body. It is meant to look like a suicide.At their boarding house Sue Allen (Phyllis Kirk) is helping Cathy get dressed for her evening out. Cathy expresses no sorrow for Burke, as she has found a new sugar daddy. Mrs. Flannigan (Riza Royce) confronts Sue upon her return from a job interview to get her back rent. Sue goes up to her room to get some money from Cathy. Cathy is dead and Jarrod is there in the room. She screams which brings the household upstairs. Sue leaves through an open window out onto the roof. Jarrod chases her down the street. She manages to slip him and calls for help at a house of an old friend. Mrs. Andrews (Angela Clarke) and her son Scott Andrews (Paul Picerni) bring her inside and she tells them Cathy was murdered and she saw the horrible visage of the murderer.The police investigate the murder at the rooming house. Lt. Tom Brennan (Frank Lovejoy) is lead and he is assisted by Sgt. Jim Shane (Dabbs Greer). The coroner (Frank Ferguson) determines Cathy\u0027s cause of death was strangulation. The surgeon (Grandon Rhodes) adds that she was drugged. Her body is taken to the morgue storage room where Jarrod is waiting under a sheet pretending to be a corpse. He\u0027s there to steal Cathy\u0027s body. With two accomplices below, he lowers her body out of a window with rope into a waiting hearse.The next morning, Mrs. Andrews, Scott and Sue come to the police station to give her report. Lt. Brennan tells them Cathy\u0027s body was stolen from the morgue. Before that, Mathew Burke\u0027s body and a few others were stolen from the morgue. He tells Sue not to leave town, but she is free to leave.Sidney Wallace is back in New York. He stops at a shop and is greeted by Igor (Charles Buchinsky/Bronson), a deaf-mute, and is escorted inside. Jarrod, looking as he did before the fire, greets Wallace sitting in a wheelchair. He tells Wallace he\u0027s rebuilding his exhibition from the ground up and will give the public what it wants, \"sensation, horror, shock.\" He adds, \"Crimes of violence will be reproduced in wax and exhibited while they are still fresh in the public mind.\" He is searching for a model for his new Marie Antoinette. He shows Wallace the basement with the wax body dip machinery. He asks Wallace to invest. He needs $30,000.The House of Wax opens for its debut. A man exits the lobby to work the crowd. The Barker (Reggie Rymal) has two paddle ball games. (Note: This was originally released as a Color 3-D movie.) He works the crowd into a frenzy by knocking things with the balls on the elastic. Jarrod greets Wallace and escorts him into the museum. He gives him the tour, along with some paying customers.Scott Andrews accompanies Sue on a tour of the Wax Museum. Wallace sees and recognizes Scott--he has been sponsoring him as a talented sculptor. Wallace wants to introduce Scott to Jarrod. While Sue wanders around she is surprised to see a Joan of Arc wax figure that looks exactly like her friend Cathy Gray. She climbs up on the tableaux to get a closer look. Jarrod sees this and approaches in his wheelchair. Sue asks, \"But why should it be so like Cathy?\" Jarrod responds, \"I think I can explain that.\" He tells her that he copied her face from newspaper clippings. Jarrod offers Scott a job, then tells Wallace he sees Marie Antoinette as Sue.Jarrod, without his makeup, goes to see Sue. He spies on her through her open window. She goes to bed. Jarrod steals into her room, but Sue wakes up and screams. Jarrod departs as Mrs. Andrews comes into her room to comfort her.Sue and Scott are at a Can-Can show having lunch. She is convinced there is something wrong about the Joan of Arc figure. Cathy had one ear pierced as does the wax figure. Such detail seems inconceivable. Scott tells Sue they\u0027ll talk to Lt. Brennan. Brennan listens to the story. To humor her, he agrees that the Police will investigate. He does confirm that someone matching Jarrod\u0027s description (with makeup) did ask to look at the photographs of Cathy\u0027s body. Brennan tells Sgt. Shane to check on Jarrod and his employees. They visit the Museum and examine the Joan of Arc. Sue stops by and climbs up on the wax figure again to touch the face. Jarrod catches her again. Jarrod shows Sue a wax head of herself. He tells her he needs her to model for his Marie Antoinette. Before Brennan and Shane leave, they notice some of the wax figures resemble people who have recently died. Shane also thinks he recognizes one of Jarrod\u0027s sculptors, Leon Averill (Nedrick Young).Wallace was waiting outside Brennan\u0027s office for Brennan and Shane to return. They arrive and ask him some questions about Jarrod. Before he leaves he vouches for Jarrod. Shane then remembers Leon as an artist imprisoned at Sing-Sing. He was then known as Hendricks and was an alcoholic. Brennan tells Shane to bring him in. They search his belongings at the station and find a watch that belonged to one of the bodies stolen from the morgue. Brennan tells Shane to book him on suspicion of murder.Jarrod sends Scott on an errand after he tells Jarrod Sue will be stopping by later. Sue enters the darkened Museum. Igor locks her in then follows her as she wanders around looking for Scott. She is drawn to the Joan of Arc and climbs back on the tableaux. She pulls back the black wig and finds Cathy\u0027s blond hair beneath. Jarrod tells her, \"You shouldn\u0027t have done that, my dear.\" Sue tells Jarrod, \"It\u0027s Cathy\u0027s body under the wax. I knew it. I knew it all the time.\" Jarrod gets up out of the wheelchair and walks towards her. She runs straight into Igor. She hits Jarrod about the head and his wax face breaks off revealing the scarred face below. She is taken to the basement where Jarrod fires up his wax machine.At police headquarters they are questioning Leon with alcohol as a bribe. He spills his guts and tells the police, \"The whole place is a morgue.\" The police race over to the House of Wax. Sue is shackled in a box with the hot wax shower threatening. Scott returns to the museum looking for Sue. Igor blocks the door to the workshop and he and Igor fight. Scott is knocked out. Igor places his body on the guillotine, but before he can operate the machine the police stop him. The police break down the door to the cellar. They fight with Jarrod on the bridge above the boiling vat of wax. Jarrod is knocked into the liquid and dies. Brennan moves the box Sue is shackled into away from the hot wax as the machinery explodes.The next morning Scott, Sue, Brennan and Shane meet in Brennan\u0027s office.

Shortly after defeating the evil entity known as Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard), the Losers Club - Bill Denbrough (Jaeden Martell), Ben Hanscom (Jeremy Ray Taylor), Beverly Marsh (Sophia Lillis), Richie Tozier (Finn Wolfhard), Eddie Kaspbrak (Jack Dylan Grazer), Stanley Uris (Wyatt Olef), and Mike Hanlon (Chosen Jacobs) - gather as Bev tells the boys about the vision she saw of all of them as adults when she faced Pennywise. The Losers make a blood pact to return to Derry in the event that they must face IT once more.27 years later in 2016, a gay couple - Adrian Mellon (Xavier Dolan) and Don Hagarty (Taylor Frey) - are enjoying a night out at the carnival when they are harassed by homophobic thugs. Even as they walk away from the carnival, the thugs follow them and start to viciously assault them. They throw Adrian over the bridge and flee into the night. Adrian almost drowns until he is pulled out of the water... except the one who pulled him out was Pennywise. Don watches in horror as the monster clown grabs Adrian and takes a huge bite out of his chest. Mike (now played by Isiah Mustafa) overhears a report of the incident over a police scanner, and when he arrives at the scene, he discovers the message \"COME HOME\" written in blood on the side of the bridge. Mike knows that IT has returned.We catch up with the other Losers in adulthood. Bill (now played by James McAvoy) is married to Audra (Jess Weixler) and has found success as an author/screenwriter, but he is frequently told that his endings are not good. Eddie (now played by James Ransone) is a risk assessor who is married to a woman, Myra (Mollie Atkinson), who is just as controlling as his own mother. Ben (now played by Jay Ryan) has slimmed down and is a successful architect, though he lives alone. Richie (now played by Bill Hader) is a stand-up comedian. Stanley (now played by Andy Bean) is a partner in an accounting firm. Bev (now played by Jessica Chastain) is a fashion designer, married to the abusive Tom Rogan (Will Beinbrink). Mike calls everyone, and they do not immediately recognize his voice until he mentions he is from Derry. Everybody becomes slightly unnerved by the phone call, and Mike beckons them to return to Derry. Bev tells Tom that she will be returning to Derry to visit friends, but he is paranoid and thinks she is lying to him and is cheating on him since he heard Mike\u0027s name. Tom starts to hit Bev until she fights back and runs away from their home. The other guys start to make their way back to Derry. The only one who doesn\u0027t go is Stanley, as he commits suicide by slitting his wrists in the tub rather than facing the nightmare from his childhood again.A flashback shows that psychotic bully Henry Bowers (Nicholas Hamilton) survived being pushed down the well by Mike and had washed out of the sewers. When he returned home, police arrested him after they came across the body of Henry\u0027s father and deduced that he murdered him. Today, Henry (now played by Teach Grant) is in a mental institution and has become even more insane. He is visited by Pennywise in the form of a zombified Patrick Hockstetter (Owen Teague), who presents Henry with his old knife.The Losers meet at the Jade of the Orient restaurant and catch up after a long absence. They joke and reminisce, but also note Stanley\u0027s absence. They start to split fortune cookies, only to each get single word fortunes that they realize form a full message. Bev\u0027s fortune reads \"Stanley\", and put together, the fortunes read \"Guess Stanley Could Not Cut It\". The Losers know that Pennywise has found them. The fortune cookies then start to crack open and reveal hideous little spider-like creatures. The Losers bash at them on the table, which only makes them look crazy when others see them attacking a table. Outside the restaurant, Bev calls Stanley\u0027s wife. Before she can say what happened, Bev knows that Stanley was found in a bathtub, and the other guys figure what happened to him.Everyone gathers at the hotel where they are staying, and Mike confesses that this is the real reason he summoned everyone back to Derry. They ask Bev how she knew how Stanley died, and she says she has seen how they all die, as she was the only one who saw the Deadlights when Pennywise captured her. Bill goes back to Mike\u0027s house, where Mike drugs Bill\u0027s water to cause him to experience a trippy vision. Mike explains that in all the time he has stayed in Derry, he has studied the history of IT and learned from a Native American tribe of the Ritual of Chud, which can be performed to destroy IT once and for all. He produces a ritualistic piece of pottery with a depiction of the ritual. They bring it back to the other Losers, and Mike explains that they need to gather artifacts from their childhood and place it in the pottery so that they can destroy Pennywise.Somewhere else in Derry, we see a little girl named Victoria (Ryan Kiera Armstrong) at a football game with her mom. Victoria is lured away by a firefly, and she follows it under the bleachers until she meets Pennywise. He uses the same manipulative trick on her to make her think he is playful, and he appeals to her sympathy when he cries about not having friends, as Victoria is made fun of for a birthmark on her cheek. Pennywise promises to make it go away, only to end up devouring Victoria.The Losers go to an old clubhouse that Ben built for them over the summer they all became friends. There, they find an artifact for Stanley, which is a shower cap. A flashback shows them as kids with Stanley asking if they will all remain friends as adults. His friends assured him that they would be.The gang splits up as they head back to their homes in Derry. Bev goes to her old home and meets the elderly Mrs. Kersh (Joan Gregson). She invites Bev inside for tea and cookies as Bev looks around. She finds an old pack of cigarettes, as well as the poem that Ben wrote for her, although she still thinks it was written by Bill. As Bev sits with Mrs. Kersh, the old woman displays unusual behavior. Bev notices what looks like rotted flesh on Mrs. Kersh\u0027s chest. She mentions to Bev that her father joined the circus. Bev sees what looks like a human Pennywise in an old picture. Mrs. Kersh then asks Bev if she is \"daddy\u0027s little girl,\" as her father had called her. The old woman is then revealed to be Pennywise as she takes on a grotesque and monstrous form that chases Bev out. Before Bev gets away, she sees Pennywise in his human form as \"Bob Gray\", who wears his clown makeup and scratches the red lines on his face to taunt Bev.Richie goes to an old arcade he went to as a kid where he picks up a token as his artifact. In a flashback, he is seen playing a game with Henry\u0027s cousin, and the bully teases Richie for being a \"fairy\". Adult Richie is then found and tormented by Pennywise, who claims to know his \"dirty little secret.\" He takes on the form of a Paul Bunyan statue and tries to attack Richie, but he gets away in time.Bill goes to an antique shop and sees that his old bike is on sale. He asks the shop owner (played by none other than Stephen King) if he can buy the bike. The owner knows of Bill\u0027s work, but agrees that his endings suck. Bill gets the bike and rides around his old street, passing the sewer where Georgie (Jackson Robert Scott) was taken. Pennywise taunts Bill with an apparition of Georgie calling to him from the sewers. Bill is almost lured in by the monster clown. As he rides away, he sees a kid named Dean (Luke Roessler), whom the gang had seen at the restaurant because he is a fan of Richie\u0027s stand-up. Dean has also seen Pennywise lately after Bill had mentioned it. He firmly orders Dean to get himself and his family out of Derry as soon as possible.Ben gets an old yearbook page, in which Bev was the only one to write for him. He is haunted by a flashback to his childhood where Pennywise took on Bev\u0027s form to ridicule Ben for his weight, as Pennywise knew that Ben loved Bev, and he still harbors feelings for her to this day. Her form\u0027s head took fire as Ben hid in a locker, only for Pennywise to be in there with him.Eddie goes to the pharmacy where he would pick up his medications. Creepy Mr. Keene (Joe Bostick) and Gretta (Juno Rinaldi) still work there. Eddie gets an inhaler before he is haunted by Pennywise in the form of his mother being attacked by the Leper (Javier Botet).Henry kills a guard and escapes the institution. He finds the Losers and attacks Eddie by stabbing him in the cheek. He manages to pull the knife out and stab Henry in the chest, albeit non-fatally, and he runs to his friends for help. However, Henry gets away again before he is caught.In another Pennywise haunting, Bill sees the message \"The fun is just beginning\" written, which is what Dean said to Richie at the restaurant, itself a line from Richie\u0027s stand-up. Bill knows that Pennywise is referring to Dean, and he goes to a carnival to try and save the boy after learning he will be there. Bill follows Dean into a hall of mirrors, but Dean just thinks Bill is a crazy weirdo. The two are then found by Pennywise, who bares his long tongue and razor-sharp teeth. Bill desperately tries to kick the glass out to save Dean, but Pennywise breaks through first and brutally attacks the boy, blocking Bill\u0027s view. Bill can only watch in horror as he fails to save the boy.Mike is in the library where Henry finds him and attacks him. Not long after, Richie comes and kills Henry by stabbing him in the back of the head. This causes Richie to puke.Bill reunites with his friends and vows to kill IT himself. His friends gather their artifacts and they join him at the Neibolt House to face off the evil entity for the last time. While there, they make it into Pennywise\u0027s lair and use the pottery to begin the ritual. The Losers throw in their artifacts, being Bev\u0027s poem, Ben\u0027s yearbook page, Richie\u0027s token, Eddie\u0027s inhaler, the boat that Bill helped make with Georgie, and a rock that Mike recovered from their rock war with the Bowers gang. The Deadlights appear and sink into the pottery with the artifacts, but just when it seems that things worked, out rises a red balloon that produces Pennywise. He faces the Losers again in his true form, as a monstrous spider that still carries his clown face, and he states how he has waited so long to see them again. Mike then reveals that the ritual never worked, and the tribe that attempted it on Pennywise got killed themselves. He splits the Losers up with more nightmare visions, including one of Stanley\u0027s severed head as a spider.Eddie and Richie find themselves in a similar scenario to when they were kids as Pennywise places three doors with \"Scary\", \"Very Scary\", and \"Not Scary At All\" for them to walk through. They see the severed half of Betty Ripsom\u0027s body, as well as a small Pomeranian that morphs into a monster. Meanwhile, Ben and Bev are trapped and split from each other, and Pennywise tries to kill Ben by having him sink into the earth while Bev is trapped in an illusion of a bathroom stall where he is harassed by the forms of Mr. Keene, Gretta, Henry, and her own father. Bev fights back against the visions and manages to pull Ben out from sinking, and she realizes he is the one who wrote her the poem as he had recited it as he was almost dying.Bill is trapped in what looks like his childhood basement. He sees his young self talking to Georgie, as the image of the little boy blames Bill for lying on the day that he died, as Bill had pretended to be sick so he wouldn\u0027t go out to play with Georgie in the rain. This had haunted Bill for years, and Pennywise knew he blamed himself for it. Young Bill goes to his adult self with a nail gun, but Adult Bill forgives himself and shoots the apparition instead.The Losers get close enough to fight Pennywise, with Eddie managing to muster up the courage to strike Pennywise himself. As he runs to Richie, however, Pennywise impales Eddie with one of his talons. The Losers try to seek a way out of there, and they figure that since Pennywise is a spider, he can make himself small to try and go after them. They then quickly realize that the only way to make him small enough to defeat him is to force him to believe he is small. They begin to yell at Pennywise and call out all of his otherwise harmless forms before he starts to shrink and shrivel into a powerless shell of his former self. This allows the Losers to pull his heart out of his chest and crush it, destroying him for good. The lair begins to crumble and collapse around them. Richie tries to get Eddie out, but he is already dead. The Losers escape the house and watch as it collapses on itself.The remaining five head to the quarry where they all swam as children. They think about Eddie and how he would have hated it since it\u0027s so dirty. Richie then starts to cry for his fallen friend, and the others console him. As they continue to swim, Ben and Bev share a kiss. As they later walk home, they see their reflections on a window and see their childhood selves, including Eddie and Stanley. One last flashback shows the group as kids riding their bikes home.Later on, Bill has gone back to work with writing, and he feels his endings are getting better. He speaks on the phone to Mike, who is thinking about finally seeing the rest of the world. They tell one another that they love each other, and Mike mentions a letter that all the Losers have been getting. Bill finds his letter and sees that it\u0027s from Stanley, written before his suicide. We hear his voice reading the letter over a small montage of the other Losers in the present. Ben and Bev are now in a relationship, while Richie goes to a bridge where he carved his and Eddie\u0027s initials, revealing that he was in love with him. Stanley\u0027s letter states that he knew he could never be brave enough to face Pennywise again, so he removed himself from the equation to give his friends a chance to honor him, which would give them the strength to fight IT. He turned out to be right.The film concludes with Mike driving away and finally leaving Derry.","numvotes":"245218","primarytitle":"It Chapter Two"},"color":"rgb(92,73,83)","size":1.0},{"source":"Horror Only","target":"tt0057129","id":"7208","attributes":{"productioncompany":"Argyle Enterprises","countriesoforigin":"United Kingdom","averagerating":"7.4","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"The Haunting","storyline":"Dr. Markway, doing research to prove the existence of ghosts, investigates Hill House, a large, eerie mansion with a lurid history of violent death and insanity. With him are the skeptical young Luke, who stands to inherit the house, the mysterious and clairvoyant Theodora and the insecure Eleanor, whose psychic abilities make her feel somehow attuned to whatever spirits inhabit the old mansion. As time goes by it becomes obvious that they have gotten more than they bargained for as the ghostly presence in the house manifests itself in horrific and deadly ways. —Doug Sederberg \u003cvornoff@sonic.net\u003e","startyear":"1963","runtimeminutes":"112","synopsis":"The film opens with narration over a silhouette of Hill House at night. The narrator, Dr. John Markway (Richard Johnson) tells us, \"An evil old house, the kind some people call haunted is like an undiscovered country waiting to be explored. Hill House had stood for 90 years and might stand for 90 more. Silence lay steadily against the wood and stone of Hill House. Whatever walked there walked alone.\" Title and credits follow, then narration continues, \"Scandal, murder, insanity, suicide: The history of Hill House was ideal. It had everything I wanted...\" The house was built in New England by a man named Hugh Crain for his wife and young daughter. A horse and carriage accident took the life of the first Mrs. Crain (an uncredited Pamela Buckley) before she even saw the house. Hugh Crain (an uncredited Howard Lang) and young daughter, Abigail (an uncredited Janet Mansell) said a few words over the body, but Hugh was left an embittered man. Crain married again, and the second Mrs. Crain (an uncredited Freda Knorr) also died, falling down the main staircase. Hugh Crain left Abigail with a nurse (an uncredited Susan Richards) and went to England where he died in a drowning accident. Abigail kept the same nursery room her entire life. By the time she was eighty (an uncredited Amy Dalby) she was a bedridden invalid. Her nurse-companion (an uncredited Rosemary Dorken) was a local girl and, it is with this young companion the evil reputation of Hill House really begins. The old lady died while calling for help. The companion was trysting on the verandah with a farm hand. The companion inherited Hill House and occupied it for many years, but eventually hanged herself. The house then passed to a distant relative, named Mrs. Sanderson (Fay Compton). Markway visits Mrs. Sanderson where he convinces her to let him use the house for psychic research. He explains, \"I shall occupy the house with a group of carefully selected assistants...I must have specially qualified help to take notes and document any evidence of the supernatural I may find.\" Eldridge Harper (Ronald Adam), Mrs. Sanderson\u0027s lawyer, voices his concern about publicity seekers and the propriety of having women in the house. Harper suggests to Mrs. Sanderson that her nephew, Luke, joins the doctor at Hill House, as he expects to inherit the property. Mrs. Sanderson asks point blank, \"Exactly what do you and your assistants expect to find at Hill House?\" Markway replies, \"Maybe only a few loose floorboards, and maybe, I only say maybe, the key to another world.\"Dr. Markway, taking a leave of absence from his university professorship, finalizes his list of assistants. Only two end up accepting, Eleanor Lance and Theodora (no last name). Eleanor Lance (Julie Harris) is living with her sister. She is nearly broke and weary after looking after her invalid mother non-stop for eleven years. Mother is now dead, and she fights with her sister over just about everything. She begs to use the car, which is after all, half hers. Her brother-in-law, Bud Fredericks (an uncredited Paul Maxwell) tries to act as mediator between Eleanor and his wife, Carrie (Diane Clare). He is sympathetic to Eleanor\u0027s plight, but their daughter, Dora (an uncredited Verina Greenlaw) takes her cues from her mother, and taunts her Aunt Eleanor. On the vacation plan, Bud sides with Eleanor, \"I think you should have a vacation, Nell.\" Carrie objects, but Eleanor is not to be deterred and she shows her family how she reacts when pushed to her breaking point. She is normally quiet and meek, but when pushed is loud and assertive. Nell decides to take the car and confronts the garage attendant (an uncredited Claude Jones) for the keys. She departs Boston along U.S. 50 and Route 238 to Hill House. We hear Nell thinking and she reveals she will never return to live with her sister. In fact, most of what we learn of Eleanor is hearing her thoughts.Eleanor arrives at Hill House. The property is surrounded by a stone wall and the entrance by a tall, iron spiked, gate. She honks the car horn, and Mr. Dudley (Valentine Dyall), the cranky caretaker, finally deigns to respond. \"What do you want?\" he asks. Eleanor explains that she is expected. After an impertinent exchange with Eleanor, Dudley finally opens the gate and allows her to enter the property. Eleanor is the first to arrive and drives up to the house. Along the way she stops to look at it. It is a huge, stone mansion with lots of detail on the façade and steep, pitched roofs. Her first reaction is that the house is vile and it is staring at her. She carries her suitcase to the front door and is greeted by Mrs. Dudley (Rosalie Crutchley). Mrs. Dudley reluctantly allows Eleanor to come inside, but does not utter a word to her. The inside of the house is dark and over-decorated, and Eleanor is escorted to her room. Mrs. Dudley explains the house rules about meals, and that she won\u0027t stay in the house after dark. Eleanor checks out the bathroom and hears the next guest arrive. Theodora (Claire Bloom) introduces herself. Eleanor explains they share a bathroom. Mrs. Dudley repeats her meal and departure rules by rote, but Theo and Nell ignore her. Theodora is a bit strange to Eleanor (Theo clearly flirts with Eleanor throughout the film) Theodora\u0027s sexual orientation is only hinted at, and we later learn she has the gift of ESP. Theo and Nell explore the house, but they get lost. Both women feel a chill, and Nell observes, \"The house, it\u0027s alive.\" Theo seems to feel that the house wants Nell. Dr. Markway appears and explains he left the door opened, but it closed itself. Markway gives the women a tour of part of the house, starting with the main purple parlor, which they will use as an operations center. He explains that all the doors were set slightly off-center, so they close themselves. Despite studying plans to the house, even Markway gets lost on his way to the dining room. They hear a noise, but it turns out to be Luke Sanderson (Russ Tamblyn) mixing a pitcher of martinis as he enters the dining room. Luke serves each person a martini. They sit down for dinner and discuss their duties and responsibilities. Markway explains that Theo was accepted because of her remarkable power of ESP and Eleanor had a poltergeist experience as a child, \"showers of stone fell on your house for three days when you were 10 years old.\" Luke is a non-believer. His interest is to financially exploit Hill House, after he inherits it, of course.That evening, in the parlor, Markway works on his notes while Eleanor sits quietly on the couch. Theo and Luke play gin rummy at the game table. Theo\u0027s ability to see cards allows her to win five games in a row, much to Luke annoyance. She demands he pay her the $12 he owes, but he refuses because she cheated. The four decide to turn in for the night and continue the tour the next morning. Markway gives them papers and asks that they complete them with their observations each night.Sometime during the night, Eleanor wakes, and still in a near dream state, thinks she hears her mother knocking on the wall. Theo hears it from the next room also and calls to Nell. The two women are frightened and both hear the pounding noise. It comes and goes, but louder each time. They finally hear a woman shrieking and laughing that fades away. When Nell opens the door she sees Luke and Markway in the hall outside. The men explain they were chasing a dog and followed it outside, but they did not hear the loud noises the women heard. Markway concludes that something is trying to separate the men and women.The next morning, Markway and Nell join for breakfast. Nell is starting to develop romantic feelings for John Markway, unaware that he is married. She tells him that she spent eleven years taking care of her invalid mother. Nell also voices her fear that she will be turned out of Hill House with no where to go. Markway tells Nell how he came to do psychic research, and that his family disapproves. Theo joins the pair and warns the doctor, \"If anyone gets hurt, it\u0027s going to be your fault, Markway.\" Markway explains that no one has ever been physically hurt by a ghost. Luke enters and directs his companions to something he saw in the hall. Someone or something has handwritten a message in chalk on the wall. It says, \"Help Eleanor Come Home.\" Eleanor reacts strongly. She first accuses Theo of playing a cruel joke. The two women bicker and Markway postpones the tour and tells Theo to take Eleanor to her room.The tour starts with the greenhouse. A large stone sculpture sits in the center of the room. It is supposed to be St. Francis curing the lepers, but Luke thinks its a family portrait of Hugh Crain and his wives and daughter. Suddenly, the door slams open and a gust of wind moves the plants. They approach the library, but Nell refuses to enter. The smell reminds her of her mother\u0027s sick room. Prominent in the room is a very tall, wrought iron, spiral staircase. Markway points out that the balcony high above is where the companion to Abigail Crain hanged herself. Luke climbs up a few feet on the staircase, but jumps back to the ground when it starts to sway and shake. Eleanor ventures out to the verandah and nearly falls over the balcony as she looks up to the tower above the library. Markway threatens to send her home, but Nell begs to stay. Markway suggests Theo and Nell share a bedroom... \"like sisters\". That evening, the two women discuss their lives and plans for the future. Nell makes up a story about having an apartment of her own. Just when Theo is about to make a move onto Nell, Markway calls them and Luke into the hallway outside the Nursery. He has discovered a cold spot. He invites all to experience the phenomenon. He gleefully explains, \"A cold spot, a genuine cold spot. I guarantee it won\u0027t register on any thermometer.\" Luke dismisses it as just a draft, but Markway says it is the heart of Hill House: The Nursery.In the middle of the night, Nell awakens. She hears a little girl laughing. She asks Theo to hold her hand, as their two beds are almost touching. The laughter continues and Nell complains, \"Theo, you\u0027re breaking my hand.\" The laughs turn to wimpering and Nell complains that something is hurting a child and she won\u0027t allow that to happen. She yells, \"Stop It!\" Theo turns on the light and we see Nell is on a day bed about twenty feet from the bed Theo occupies. Nell stares at her hand and asks, \"Whose hand was I holding?\" The next morning, Markway is in the music room and checks his watch and makes a note about the harp playing itself. Nell enters the room and asks about how it could play itself. Markway explains that it may be preternatural: Something we don\u0027t have any natural explanation for right now, but probably will have some day. Nell voices her fear that it is all in her imagination and concludes she may be going insane. She is haunted by the circumstances of her mother\u0027s death and that she may somehow be responsible. They both hear the harp play a note and Markway again checks his watch and makes a note in his paperwork.That evening, Luke finds a disturbing book that Hugh Crain made for his daughter, Abigail. Nell and Theo bicker and Markway notes that everyone\u0027s nerves are on edge. Theo continues to flirt as well as needle Nell, this time about a budding romance she fantasizes about with John Markway. Nell runs away and Theo catches up to her, and tells Nell that is he is making a fool of herself in thinking that Dr. Markway will ever get involved with her. Nell accuses Theo of being an \"unnatural thing\" as well as a \"nature\u0027s mistake.\" At that moment, a car horn honks and a taxi pulls up in front of the house. Grace Markway (Lois Maxwell), John\u0027s wife, arrives. She informs her husband, \"A reporter\u0027s been telephoning all day. He\u0027s on your track. He\u0027s heard about you renting this place.\" Grace begs her husband to abandon the house and his research. When John refuses, Grace pays the driver, grabs her suitcase and announces she is staying at Hill House, \"to join the ghost hunt.\" When Eleanor casually mentions the nursery as a place to stay, Grace quickly accepts the challenge, \"Thank you, my dear. The nursery it is.\" Markway and Nell try to dissuade her, but Grace responds, \"You insult my intelligence. You don\u0027t think I\u0027d believe anything you ghost hunters might tell me.\" Luke notices the door to the nursery is open for the first time. Grace decides to spend the night in the room, despite everyone\u0027s warning not to. Markway insists he and the three researchers spend the night downstairs in the parlor.Later that night, Nell and Theo sleep together on the sofa by the fireplace as Markway sleeps in a chair. Luke finishes his tour upstairs and enters the parlor. He heads for a bottle on the mantle. Suddenly, the parlor door slams shut by itself and the others wake with a start. They hear a deep rhythmic banging outside the door. Markway is concerned about his wife upstairs. Next a very loud banging comes from just outside the door. The unseen phantom presses against the parlor door as it bows inward and out like breathing, creaking and crunching against the hinges. The sound moves to overhead towards the nursery. Markway is desperate to check on his wife. Unseen, Nell runs from the parlor, through the music room, and upstairs directly to the nursery room. The doors are open, but Grace Markway is nowhere to be seen. Her bed shows signs of being used. Markway and the others arrive and start the search. Nell wanders away. She finds herself in the greenhouse. Descending into her own little world, Nell dances out onto the verandah. When she hears the others calling to her, Nell runs into the Library. She is drawn to the spiral staircase and the balcony at the top. Before she reaches the top, the rickety staircase begins its swaying, the lateral support bolts pulling away from the wall. Markway calls to her, begging her to carefully walk back down. She ignores him and stands on the balcony. Markway carefully climbs the stairs and joins Nell on the iron balcony platform. Before they walk back down, Nell sees Grace Markway peer at her through a trap door in the ceiling.A little later, Markway is furious and now insists Eleanor leave the house for her own safety. Luke brings her car around and Theo packs her bag. Nell tries to talk them out of her dismissal, but the three insist she leave. They escort Eleanor out to her car. Luke gets back out of Nell\u0027s car to retrieve the gate key from Markway. She drives off without Luke. Before she reaches the gate she is distracted by the white-robed figure of Grace Markway and crashes into a tree. The three find Eleanor dead in the half overturned car. She crashed into the same tree that killed the first Mrs. Crain. Grace wanders over to the accident scene. She explains to her husband, \"I didn\u0027t want any of this to happen. You must believe me, John.\" She explains that she woke and was frightened. She got lost looking for her husband and ended up in the attic. While Theo blames Grace for Eleanor\u0027s accident, Luke takes a different view. \"Eleanor did it to herself. It looked to me, anyway, like she deliberately aimed the car at this tree.\" Markway blames the house. Luke stares at the house and remarks, \"It ought to be burned down and the ground sowed with salt.\" We close with an evening shot of Hill House with Eleanor, now a ghost, narrating from beyond the grave about Hill House and that \"we who walk here... walk alone.\" The end title comes up as well as the final title card \u0027The Haunting\u0027 followed by eerie piano music.","numvotes":"38733","primarytitle":"The Haunting"},"color":"rgb(93,99,84)","size":1.0},{"source":"commercialism","target":"tt0070783","id":"6723","attributes":{"notes":"Disability motif","runtimeminutes":"93","sex of killer":"male","synopsis":"In the London wax museum of Claude Dupree, known for its collection of famous figures, someone is killing the guests .

The shot pans the upstairs floor where Margaret is crying out to God in agony. We see a puddle of water that has splattered a Bible and numerous droplets of blood. Margaret is writhing on the bed in agony thinking she has been afflicted with a cancer, and begs for God\u0027s mercy as she is taken. Her body contorts a few times as she screams and she looks up waiting to die. But she doesn\u0027t. She realizes she is still alive and there is something underneath her nightdress. She looks between her legs and finds a baby. She had been pregnant and didn\u0027t know it. Margaret nods. \"It\u0027s a test,\" she says, and reaches for scissors, ready to slay her newborn daughter. She almost stabs the baby, when something stops her at the last second. She puts the scissors down and cradles her newborn daughter.Cut to present day. Carrie White (Chloe Grace Moretz), now age 17 or 18, is a meek, shy young girl at her high school located in the small town of Castle Rock, Maine. Considered an outcast by everyone, she sneaks into the background hoping she will not be noticed. During P.E. class, during the gym game of water volleyball, the ball lands in front of her and she is asked to serve the ball. She accidentally hits Sue Snell (Gabriella Wilde) in the head which makes everyone, including Carrie, laugh. Sue\u0027s friend, Chris Hargensen (Portia Doubleday) tells Carrie, \"you eat shit\", so everyone starts laughing at her instead.After gym, Carrie starts to take a shower alone when she notices blood. She races to the girls for help, not understanding what is going on. The girls, led by Chris, realize Carrie is having her first period and doesn\u0027t understand it. Instead of helping, they throw tampons at her and chant: \"plug it up.\" Chris even films it on her iPhone. Even Sue joins in with the chanting and taunting, but stops halfway through, ashamed of what she is doing. The gym teacher, Ms. Desjardin (Judy Greer) overhears them and in an effort to calm her down, slaps Carrie to keep her from screaming. Ms. Desjardin yells for everyone to get out. As the girls file out, a light shatters. Sue looks at Carrie with deep regret and guilt.Carrie is taken to the principal\u0027s office with Ms. Desjardin as they try to explain what has happened (with the principal, Henry Grayle, severely uncomfortable with it). He tells Ms. Desjardin to handle the punishment of the girls that participated in the incident. The principal and Ms. Desjardin tell Carrie that they have called her mother to pick her up. Carrie goes completely white, begging them not to call her mom. Principal Grayle says they know the school has problems with her mother since the state disallowed her mother to home school Carrie, but Ms. Desjardin reassures her and says it will be okay. Carrie starts hyperventilating and a nearby water cooler shatters. Carrie leaves the office.Margaret comes to pick up Carrie. Nearby, Sue, Chris and her rough boyfriend Billy Nolan (Alex Russell) sit. Chris shows everyone the video of Carrie, who sees what Chris \u0026 the others are doing. Sue looks on at Carrie, and her face betrays more guilt.On the way home Carrie apologizes to her mother for making her come to school.When they get home, Carrie wants to talk to Margaret about why she didn\u0027t explain to her about her period. \"I thought I was dying,\" Carrie says. Margaret is evasive and tells her to come inside. Carrie tells her mother she won\u0027t; she wants to talk about what happened. As Carrie sits in the car, a local boy rides around it on his bicycle and calls her \"Crazy Carrie.\" Carrie apparently uses her powers to makes him fall off his bike, which scares him into fleeing.Inside the house, Carrie finds her mother banging her head on the wall. Carrie tells her to stop and just talk to her. Margaret, however, is more concerned with praying for forgiveness and creates her own bible verses on a whim to suit her needs. Carrie recognizes these \u0027verses\u0027 are not even real Bible verses and objects to her mother\u0027s prayers, but Margaret knocks her in the head with a bible. As their argument heads downstairs to the kitchen, Margaret calls her a sinner. \"I did not sin,\" Carrie says. Margaret opens the \"Prayer Closet\" and tells Carrie to get in. Carrie refuses so her mother throws her in and latches the door, telling her to pray for forgiveness. Carrie bangs on the door, begging to be let out. \"GOD, YOU SON OF A BITCH!\" Carrie screams, and then suddenly a crack is formed through the middle of the door to both their surprise. Carrie looks at a sculpture hanging on the wall of Jesus nailed to the cross. It begins to bleed to her horror.Meanwhile, Sue and her boyfriend, Tommy Ross (Ansel Elgort) are having sex in a jeep, though Sue\u0027s mind is somewhere else. They get dressed, and Sue talks about her guilt about what happened to Carrie and how she initially helped. Tommy relates he once beat a bully that had tormented him. He says the guy had it coming. \"What did Carrie White ever do you?\" Tommy asks.At the same time, Chris and Billy, along with another girlfriend, named Tina, hang out at her house. Chris is unrepentant about what she has done, and on a whim, decides to upload the video to YouTube, humiliating Carrie even further.Back at the White household, Margaret is making clothes and singing Bible songs. She eventually opens the closet and finds Carrie sleeping. She wakes her up and asks if she said her prayers. Carrie says yes, and Margaret becomes a loving mother again. They exchange \u0027I love you\"s.The next day, Ms. Desjardin lays down the law with Chris, Sue, and all the other girls that participated in Carries shaming. Ms. Desjardin asks about Chris and Sue\u0027s dates for the prom and tells Sue she would\u0027ve voted her Prom Queen but not anymore. Ms. Desjardin tells them it was a \"very shitty\" thing they did to Carrie and they are going to pay for it. She also mentions that apparently someone took a video of the incident, looking at Chris as she is pretty sure that she is the one who did it. They will be doing suicide sprints after school for a week. Anyone who refuses the punishment is suspended and cannot go to prom. \"While you run, I want you to think long and hard about what it would be like to be Carrie White,\" Ms. Desjardin says.After a while, Chris calls \"bullshit\" on the whole punishment, saying Ms. Desjardin can\u0027t do it. Sue tries to tell her to take the punishment and let it go but she won\u0027t. Chris refuses, so Ms. Desjardin suspends her and revokes her prom privileges. Chris says Ms. Desjardin can\u0027t take away prom from her and tries to rally the other girls to go with her. One by one, they refuse, including Sue, the only one who shows any true remorse. They continue to run while Chris screams: \"This is not over!\"Meanwhile, everyone snickers at Carrie, having seen the video. As Carrie walks down the hall, humiliated, she stares in disgust at graffiti that someone has sprayed across a bank of lockers saying, \u0027Carrie White eats shit\u0027. She goes in the bathroom and concentrates on the mirror. After a moment, she is able to smash it to her shock. Looking at the pieces she makes them levitate for a moment until another girl shows up. Carrie grabs her bag and leaves.Carrie goes to the library and looks to the web and numerous books about telekinesis. After seeing a video about telekinesis, she decides to test her own abilities with it in subtle ways. In class, Carrie looks at the flag outside the window, and makes it move. She smiles with a sense of accomplishment.Carrie is called to the front of the class and reads a favorite poem. It is quite dark, but well written and people pay attention to her. The teacher, Mr. Ullman, is amazed she has talked at all, and asked if she has something else to say after scaring the classroom. \"You asshole,\" Tommy mutters under his breath. The teacher asks what he said. Tommy said the poem was \"awesome\" and asks the teacher if he thought the same thing. Carrie looks at Tommy shyly and smiles.Meanwhile, Margaret is seen working at a dry cleaner/seamstress store. Someone calls out for help and it turns out to be Eleanor Snell, Sue\u0027s mother. She is picking up Sue\u0027s prom dress. Mrs. Snell tries to apologize for Sue\u0027s behavior and commends Margaret on the work she did. Meanwhile, Margaret is cutting herself on the leg with a needle, making herself bleed. \"These are godless times,\" Margaret says before returning to her work.Chris gets a meeting with Ms. Desjardin and Principal Grayle with her arrogant lawyer father to try and overturn her suspension and revoked prom privileges. Chris tries to play the victim, but Ms. Desjardin plays better hardball than her, saying there was a video uploaded and if Chris just proves it isn\u0027t on her phone, then she will get an apology and be allowed to go to prom. Her father tells her to give up the phone, but Chris refuses to and storms out, thus indirectly admitting her complicity and making sure her suspension and punishment stay active.Sue and the prom committee work on turning the gymnasium into the prom. Chris storms in, angrily telling her friends that she is banned from prom, and asks why the girls didn\u0027t back her up. She then asks why Sue didn\u0027t. Sue says because she deserved the punishment, they all did. Ms. Desjardin was right; they did a shitty thing to Carrie. Chris balks and says Carrie deserved it. \"What has Carrie White ever done to you?\" Sue asks her soon to be former friend. Chris tells Sue that she is not being high and mighty because she feels bad; it\u0027s because she wants to go to prom with Tommy then have sex with him in the hotel she already booked. \"You don\u0027t give a shit about Carrie White,\" Chris sneers, leaving.We see Sue at home, looking at her prom dress lovingly.Back at the White household, Carrie is in her room making books move, testing her powers. She eventually makes several levitate including her bed. Margaret hears the noise and takes a butcher knife to investigate. When she gets to Carrie\u0027s room, Carrie has fooled her, turning out the lights. Margaret puts the knife down and says she will never let anyone hurt her little girl. Carrie then accidentally causes the knife to stick into the floor, shocking Margaret.The next day, Sue watches Tommy play lacrosse. Sue comes up to Tommy and asks for a favor; she wants him to take Carrie to the prom. Tommy is shocked, saying he wants to take her, but Sue wants to do something to make up for the humiliation Carrie was put through. \"I\u0027m trying to fix what I did,\" she says. Tommy tries to convince her, but Sue says she can\u0027t go and begs him to help her make things right.Tommy finds Carrie at lunch and shocks her by talking to her. Tommy asks her about prom and if she would like to go with him. Carrie runs off without responding. Tommy tracks her down and asks again, but Carrie thinks it is a joke. \"Stop trying to trick me,\" Carrie says. \"I\u0027m not,\" Tommy replies. Carrie doesn\u0027t believe him however, and runs off.Carrie is crying in the locker room and is discovered by Ms. Desjardin. Ms. Desjardin thinks the girls did something again but Carrie says she got invited to prom. Ms. Desjardin says that\u0027s a happy thing and asks who asked her. Carrie says Tommy Ross. Ms. Desjardin, realizing something is up, stays neutral saying he is a cute boy. Carrie says she knows he dates Sue Snell and thinks this a big joke to him. \"They\u0027re going to trick me again,\" Carrie says. Ms. Desjardin says maybe not. Carrie ponders why Tommy would want to go with her. Ms. Desjardin directs Carrie to the mirror telling her she sees a beautiful girl and with the right dress and the tiniest dash of makeup she can stun everyone speechless.Ms. Desjardin confronts Sue and Tommy thinking they are planning something. \"If the two of you are planning some kind of joke on a poor, lonely, defenseless girl...\" Ms. Desjardin warns them. However, Sue says she is trying to do a good thing for Carrie; allow her one good night and a chance to be social. Tommy says it doesn\u0027t matter since Carrie said no, but Sue tells him to try again. Ms. Desjardin tries to appeal to Tommy saying he will look \u0027ridiculous\u0027 with Carrie on his arm, but Sue says this is a private matter and they don\u0027t care how they look doing it.Tommy drives over to Carrie\u0027s house and tells her he is not leaving till she says yes to prom. Fearful her mother will see them, Carrie says yes but that she will have to be home by 10:30 pm. Tommy says he will pick her up at 7:00 pm. Carrie smiles.Carrie goes into town and sees a dress shop. She looks at one in the store front and her body reflected onto it. Going inside, she sees that they are too pricey for what she can afford. She sees some fabric and stares at awe at the potential. From across the street, Chris and her friends see Carrie at the store and Chris seethes in rage. It is at this time that Chris begins to plot revenge against Carrie for what Chris sees as getting her banned from prom, and apparently enlists the help of her friends Tina, twins Nicki \u0026 Lizzy, and Heather.That evening, Carrie walks home seeing her mom waiting for her in the front yard. Margaret is livid since she didn\u0027t know where she was. Carrie says she went into town to buy fabric to make herself a gown. Margaret says she is not allowed to go anywhere but school and home. Carrie then tells her the news; she\u0027s been asked to prom. Carrie tells her that she knows she is scared and she is too. However, the kids laugh at her and think she is weird. She doesn\u0027t want to be weird; she wants to be normal and thinks prom may be her final chance. \"I have to try and be a whole person before it is too late,\" Carrie says. Margaret is livid and tells her to go to her closet and repent before it is too late. Carrie asks why she can\u0027t be happy for her. But the insane Margaret refuses to listen and orders Carrie to go to her closet. Carrie then has an episode and makes everything in the living room jump up. Margaret falls to the floor in shock and starts to pray. Carrie tells her mom to get up and when she doesn\u0027t, she raises her with her powers. Margaret calls Carrie a devil, but Carrie says she has powers and others have them too. Carrie states that her grandmother may have had them and it\u0027s possible that they skipped a generation to Carrie. Carrie places her mother down and her mother says she thought she was a cancer when she was born. Carrie tells her that is a horrible thing to say and levitates her again. She tells her she is going to prom, she will not stop her, and they are not talking about it anymore. Carrie then releases her.Meanwhile, Chris, Billy and a few others are at a pig farm. Billy callously crushes a pig\u0027s head and Chris slits the throat to collect the blood.The next day, Sue is working on the prom decorations when she feels sick. She runs to the bathroom and throws up. Shock hits her face; she thinks she is pregnant.We see Carrie make her prom dress. Chris and Billy break into the gymnasium and rig the pail with the pig blood. Billy tells Chris she can drop it on Carrie, and Chris states she has every intention of doing so.Sue puts her dress away, committing to her decision.We see a montage of the students get ready and dressed for prom. We see Carrie put her dress on and apply some light makeup. She has fully transformed herself into the beautiful woman she was meant to be.Margaret tells her she looks like a deviant. Carrie, having enough of her mother\u0027s overly religious quotes, asks that for once that her mom could be happy for her. Margaret says they are going to laugh at her, but Carrie says to stop it. Tommy is a nice boy and everything is going to be fine. As Tommy shows up, Margaret tells her daughter that she was conceived by what was basically marital rape and how she tried to kill her as a baby. Carrie, finally losing all her patience, force-chokes her mom. \"There will be a judgment Carrie\", Margaret says. Carrie opens the closet and locks her mother in with her powers, saying she will be back at 10:30 pm as promised. She then melts the door lock so her mother can\u0027t get out.Carrie goes outside to meet Tommy. \"Do I look okay?\" Carrie asks. \"You look beautiful,\" Tommy says, meaning it.They drive to prom in a limo. Carrie requests a moment, thinking about the other students. Tommy tells her despite what she thinks they aren\u0027t all bad. Calming her down, they go in, where she is introduced to Tommy\u0027s best friend and his girlfriend, who goes to another school. The other girl compliments Carrie on her dress, and is pleasantly surprised to find out that Carrie made it herself.Carrie begins to loosen up. Tommy asks if she wants to dance but they agree to wait till a slow one comes on, after Carrie sees some wild dance moves from another student and isn\u0027t sure what to make of them. Ms. Desjardin sees Carrie and tells her how beautiful she looks. While they talk, Tommy texts Sue, telling her that everything is okay, Carrie is enjoying herself and that he misses her. Sue smiles, content that she is making it right.A slow song comes on and Tommy convinces Carrie to dance with him. He teaches her how to slow dance and she quickly learns. Carrie puts her head on his shoulder then backs away. Something crosses Tommy\u0027s face when that happens; while he is still obviously loyal to Sue, he is starting to grow some feelings for Carrie due to her being such a sweet person. Carrie, still unsure about his intentions asks why he asked her to prom. Tommy says that he wanted to, and is having a good time with her and hopes she is feeling the same way. Carrie nods yes. Tommy then says they will enjoy their time here then they can go to an after party and he will have back home on time. Carrie smiles, agrees, and notes that she can maybe stay out till 11.Thanks to Chris\u0027s friend Tina, Billy and Chris break into the prom and sit in the rafters waiting. They hand off ballots to Tina\u0027s date, Greg Delois, who switches them out to rig the Prom King and Queen election to ensure Carrie \u0026 Tommy are elected.The voting for Prom King and Queen begins. Carrie questions voting for herself but Tommy tells her there isn\u0027t much to it, and she should have one chance to be in the spotlight. Carrie notes that the crowns are beautiful. \"The Devil with false modesty,\" Tommy says. Carrie is convinced so they vote for themselves. Meanwhile, Chris\u0027s friends switch out the ballots to rig them in Tommy and Carrie\u0027s favor.Chris texts on her cell phone to Sue while Sue is getting out of the shower. She says \"Your girl looks good. She won\u0027t for long.\" Horror washes over Sue\u0027s face; she knew Chris was vindictive but not to this extent. Sue realizes that Chris has planned something horrifying to humiliate Carrie, and races to prom to try to stop her.Chris seems to have second thoughts for a moment. Billy reminds her that what they are doing is criminal assault, and they need to flee the second they are done.Meanwhile, Sue gets to the building but can\u0027t get in. She sees someone open the door and sneaks in.The \"ballots\" are counted. Tommy and Carrie win. Carrie is stunned but happy. They walk up to the podium with everyone applauding. Ms. Desjardin, Mr. Ullman, and Principal Grayle are especially happy for Carrie, glad to see that she has finally got her moment in the sun.Sue looks around and sees Chris in the rafters. Chris sees Sue looking at her. She hesitates momentarily, but Billy goads her on to pull the rope. Ms. Desjardin sees Sue and misconstrues her reasons for being there and throws her out of the building without hearing her warning.Chris pulls the rope. Although the rope jams and forces Chris to pull on it several times, it eventually gives way and the pig blood cascades down and drowns Carrie in it. Complete and utter silence follows. \"WHAT THE HELL?!\" Tommy yells at everyone, having and wanting no part in this unbelievable act of cruelty. Chris has hacked the video monitors, and using her iPhone, plays Carrie\u0027s period video. Most of the class laughs, but Ms. Desjardin, along with a few others, are in complete shock. Ms. Desjardin goes to Carrie but Carrie pushes her back with her powers, startling everyone.Chris and Billy rig the rope and begin to flee but Chris wants to stick around and see Carrie squirm. The rope, however, gives way and the pail that held the blood cracks Tommy on the back of the head, killing him instantly. Carrie turns back around and cradles his head in her lap, absolutely devastated that the only boy that ever treated her kindly has been killed. Carrie looks up in the rafters and recognizes Billy\u0027s sunglasses. She knows who is responsible. Something snaps in her mind. She turns to the guests, as the blood on her body starts to levitate off it. A few see this and try to flee in horror but it is no use.Carrie finally loses control and violently force-pushes the entire crowd back, people hitting tables and each other. She then slams all the doors of the gym shut and locks them, so no one can get out. One of the girls, Heather, is force-thrown across the room and has her head smashed into a closed door. Tina\u0027s date, Greg Delois, and a few other guys try to escape by climbing the bleachers, but Carrie collapses them, gorily crushing Greg to death. As a boy films her, she throws a table at him, the force of the hit killing him. Carrie then trips the sprinklers leaving the whole room soaked in water. As she sees the twin girls Nicki and Lizzy, friends of Chris, trying to flee, she forces-pushes them to the ground where they are trampled to death by the fleeing mob. Behind Carrie on the stage, a light fixture drops from the ceiling, touching off a fire on the stage and exposing several live electrical cables. Seeing Chris\u0027s friend Tina attempting to escape, Carrie force-throws a burning decoration at her but misses. Carrie then uses the live electrical cables to torture Tina, driving her back towards a smaller fire burning on the floor. The hem of the dress comes in contact with the fire, and in seconds the flames have engulfed the dress, causing Tina to burn to death. As flames envelop the room, Ms. Desjardin tries to calm Carrie down but Carrie grabs her in a Darth Vader-like force-choke hold and pulls her up, holding her for a moment above the floor that has become electrified as the electrical cables come in contact with the water from the sprinklers. However, her reasoning returns momentarily and she spares Ms. Desjardin, pulling her across to the stage, as she was one of the few people that were ever nice to her. Carrie then levitates herself out of the building as Ms. Desjardin and the few remaining students watch in horror and shock.By now the entire school is in flames. While people some escape, many don\u0027t. Carrie sees Chris and Billy\u0027s red car. Her rage returns.Chris asks Billy what they should do as their little prank is now responsible for at least a dozen deaths. Billy tells her they will leave town and never come back. Chris agrees reluctantly. As they drive off, Carrie is behind them. She stomps the ground and causes it to cave out ahead. Billy turns the car around and speeds back. Chris sees Carrie and despite everything, will not give up her vendetta. \"RUN HER DOWN. KILL HER!\" Chris snarls. Billy says he has it under control and charges Carrie. Carrie however is waiting for him and stops the car with her power, the force causing Billy to hit the steering wheel hard, breaking his nose, and causing his head to violently snap back and kill him instantly. Chris comes to a few minutes later, and realizes Billy is dead from the impact. She cries but when she sees Carrie, she reaches for the keys and backs up, still hell-bent on killing her. When she charges again, Carrie pulls the car\u0027s back wheels up high in the air, and then throws the vehicle into a gas station pump. The force of the throw causes Chris\u0027s face to go through the windshield making shards of glass embed all around her face. Carrie watches as Chris breathes her last breath. As an extra precaution and because Chris deserved it, Carrie causes a power pole to spark and collapse, igniting the leaking gasoline and causing an explosion that guarantees Billy\u0027s and Chris\u0027s deaths.Back at the burned gym, Sue sees Ms. Desjardin and they both sob at the destruction.Carrie begins to walk home, destroying everything in her path. When she gets inside, she sees her mom had forced a hole from the crack in the door and has escaped from the closet. Carrie calls out to her but gets no response. Her mother is hiding in the shadows.Carrie gets into the bathtub and cleans off all the blood, changing into a blue nightgown. She finds Margaret and tells her she was right about everything. They hug and Margaret suggests they pray. As they pray, Margaret takes her butcher knife and stabs Carrie once in the back. Carrie then pushes her mother back as she falls down the stairs. Their fight continues in the kitchen as Carrie begs her mother to stop what she is doing. \"You know a devil never dies. You gotta keep killing it,\" Margaret says, manic. They struggle and she slices Carrie on the leg and arm. When she tries to stab Carrie in the face, Carrie stops the blade with her powers and then pulls up numerous sharp objects and points them in her mother\u0027s direction. Telling her she is sorry, Carrie lets them fly, and they impale her mother to the wall as if in a crucifix-like pose.Carrie, horrified by what she is done, releases the blades that pin her mother to the wall. Margaret dies moments later in Carrie\u0027s lap. Carrie cries at the loss.Moments later, Sue arrives at the house. Carrie is angry with her saying she just killed her mother and she wants her back. \"Why couldn\u0027t you leave me alone?\" Carrie asks. Sue says she tried to help her. Carrie puts Sue in a force choke-hold as the house begins to collapse around them due to her powers becoming uncontrollable. \"Don\u0027t hurt me Carrie,\" Sue pleads. \"Why not?\" Carrie snarls. Then, Carrie puts Sue down. Sue tries to reach for Carrie so they can escape. Carrie places her hand near Sue\u0027s stomach. \"It\u0027s a girl,\" Carrie says. Sue looks at her in shock. \"You don\u0027t know?\" Carrie asks. Carrie pushes her out of the house. Sue watches as rocks come out of nowhere and fall directly on the house, collapsing it on itself. Carrie holds her mother and kisses her forehead as the house finally falls down on the both of them. Sue looks on in horror and gingerly touches her stomach.An undisclosed time later, Sue is giving a deposition in front of the whole town (as to her pregnancy subplot, it is very unclear whether Sue is still pregnant or not and/or she kept the baby). The man interviewing her asks if what she saw happen could\u0027ve been a natural accident. Sue however, stands by her story. Carrie was just a normal girl with normal hopes and desires like everyone else, and they pushed her and when people get pushed, eventually they break. They broke Carrie White.We see Sue at the graveyard where Margaret and Carrie are at a joint plot. Someone has spray painted \"CARRIE WHITE IS IN HELL\" on the gravestone with an arrow pointing down. Even in death, someone still had to be heartless to the poor, lonely girl who only wanted to be accepted. Sue lays a white rose at the grave and leaves. A moment later a force comes up from the ground, cracking the tombstone down the middle. In the middle, a crater forms in the shape of a heart. Carrie\u0027s ultimate fate is left ambiguous.","numvotes":"138581","primarytitle":"Carrie"},"color":"rgb(92,73,83)","size":1.0},{"source":"Comedy","target":"tt0052655","id":"6986","attributes":{"notes":"The artist takes revenge on critics; comedy or satire","runtimeminutes":"66","sex of killer":"male","synopsis":"At the Yellow Door café, a popular hangout for the beatnik crowd in Venice, California, busboy Walter Paisley (Dick Miller) is deeply impressed by Maxwell H. Brock\u0027s spontaneous poetry recital. Despite the poet\u0027s open disdain for his simplistic, gullible nature, Walter clings to Maxwell\u0027s words and admires his associates, especially sketch artist Carla (Barbour Morris). Unknown to the customers and Yellow Door owner Leonard De Santis, two undercover police officers, Art Lacroix and Lou Raby, take turns staking out the café for possible drug deals.After his shift ends, Walter returns to his small apartment frustrated over his inability to convince the Yellow Door patrons of his artistic potential. When his attempt at sculpting proves futile, Walter lashes out angrily at his landlady\u0027s cat and accidentally kills the animal. At first horrified, Walter then covers the cat\u0027s body with clay and the next day presents it to Leonard and Carla as a work of art.Amazed by the realistic quality of the \"sculpture,\" Leonard displays the cat in the café and that evening Walter is showered with praise by the Yellow Door regulars, including Maxwell. One customer, Naolia, is so moved by the work that she offers Walter a small vial as a gift. Lou notices the exchange and, following Walter home, asks to see the vial and discovers it contains heroin. Walter is surprised and confused when Lou reveals his identity and demands to know the name of his dealer. Frightened when Lou pulls a gun and places him under arrest, Walter lashes out with a frying pan, splitting Lou\u0027s skull. Meanwhile at the café, Leonard is closing up when he accidentally knocks over Walter\u0027s cat sculpture and to his horror, discovers fur underneath the clay.The next afternoon when Walter returns to work, Leonard makes sarcastic remarks to him about his artistic talent, but Carla and Maxwell come to his defense. Emboldened, Walter reveals he has a new work to show them, entitled \"Murdered Man,\" which stuns Leonard. On his way to telephone the authorities, however, Leonard is approached by a wealthy art collector who offers five hundred dollars for the cat sculpture. Leonard warily agrees, then later goes with Carla to Walter\u0027s apartment to see the new work, which is Lou\u0027s body covered with clay. Shocked, Leonard refuses to display the work at the Yellow Door, but when Carla and Walter express puzzlement, Leonard suggests Walter make other pieces in order to put together a show. The distressed café owner encourages Walter to move away from realism and try \"free form\" art, then pays him fifty dollars from the cat sculpture sale.Ecstatic by his newfound success, Walter ceases working at the Yellow Door, and, affecting a beatnik style, becomes one of the café\u0027s customers, where he joins Maxwell\u0027s table of artists. One afternoon soon after Walter\u0027s initial success, Alice, a part-time model who has been out of town, joins the group but is critical of Walter, whom she knows only as a busboy. Offended by Alice\u0027s put-downs, Walter departs, but later follows her home to ask her to pose for him. Alice agrees and goes to Walter\u0027s apartment, where he strangles her with a scarf, then makes another \"sculpture\" that he takes to the café the next day.Profoundly affected by Walter\u0027s abilities, Maxwell delivers a poetic homage to him that night at the Yellow Door. After a drunken, boisterous night of acclaim, Walter heads for home, but grows frightened at the notion that his fame might be short-lived. Spotting a man cutting wood at a lumber mill, Walter attacks the man and cuts his head off with a large table saw. The next day, Leonard is mortified when Walter brings in his newest work, the bust of a man, and pleads with him to stop sculpting, declaring they have enough pieces for a show. Walter agrees and Leonard sends out invitations for his exhibition.On the night of the show, Walter takes Carla aside and proposes, but Carla insists that while she admires Walter\u0027s works, she is not in love with him. Angered and hurt, Walter asks Carla if she will pose for him later and she agrees. At the show, Walter, distressed over Carla\u0027s rejection, ignores the renowned art critics admiring his work. A little later, Carla closely examines Alice\u0027s sculpture and is terrified when some melting clay reveals a real finger. Carla confronts Walter who quotes Maxwell\u0027s poetry and insists he has only immortalized worthless people. Appalled, Carla flees from the café and Walter follows. Meanwhile, Art has also examined some sculptures and, realizing they are dead bodies, pursues Walter. Maxwell and several of his friends also discover the truth behind the sculptures and run after Walter.Haunted by the voices of his victims who assure him that he will be reviled now that he has been discovered, Walter abandons chasing Carla and instead rushes home in fright. When Art, Maxwell, Carla and the others arrive at the apartment, they find that Walter has hanged himself in despair.","numvotes":"6798","primarytitle":"A Bucket of Blood","productioncompany":"Alta Vista Productions","countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"6.7","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"A Bucket of Blood","sex of artist":"male","storyline":"Walter Paisley, nerdy busboy at a Bohemian café, is jealous of the talent (and popularity) of its various artistic regulars.

The older nun goes through the door to find some kind of artifact, while the younger nun, Sister Victoria (Charlotte Hope) starts to pray. The older nun emerges attacked and bloodied, telling Victoria to run before she is pulled back into the darkness. Victoria runs toward a window as the attacker while clutching a key, the demon nun Valak (Bonnie Aarons), moves slowly but closer toward her. Victoria asks God for forgiveness before she jumps and hangs herself. Sometime later, her decaying body is discovered by a man simply known as Frenchie (Jonas Bloquet).The officials at the Vatican learn of Victoria\u0027s suicide, which is considered the ultimate sin. They enlist Father Anthony Burke (Demian Bichir) to investigate. He seeks out a young novitiate named Sister Irene (Taissa Farmiga), who currently acts as a teacher to young girls. The two get together and go to find Frenchie so he can take them to where he found Victoria\u0027s body.The three go to the abbey where Frenchie leads Burke and Irene to the ice box where he left Victoria\u0027s body. Frenchie points out that Victoria is sitting up when he left her body lying down. Burke pries Victoria\u0027s fingers open and finds the key in her hand. They then take her body to give her a proper burial. While walking back toward the abbey, Burke notices fresh blood on the steps where Frenchie found Victoria\u0027s body. They then go into the chapel but cannot enter the abbey yet. They meet the Abbess (Gabrielle Downey), who informs them that are engaging in a vow of silence for Victoria, and that they may enter the next day.Burke and Irene go to their rooms while Frenchie leaves. He walks past the dark woods and sees what looks like Victoria walking through the woods. He follows her and ends up attacked by a demon nun. Frenchie picks up a cross from the ground and walks away with it.Irene tells Burke about a series of visions she experienced as a child, all of which ended with her hearing the phrase \"Mary points the way\". Burke then recalls an incident in France in which he was summoned to exorcise a young boy named Daniel (August Maturo) that had been possessed. Despite Burke\u0027s efforts, the boy sustained fatal injuries from the exorcism, and Burke has been wracked with guilt ever since.Later that night, Burke is awoken by the sound of music. He goes out into the woods and sees what looks like a demonic version of Daniel. The vision comes to life and pushes Burke into a coffin before an unholy force buries him alive, leaving him with a bell to ring. Irene also wakes up and wanders the chapel before she sees Valak in the mirror trying to attack her. She runs outside and hears Burke ringing the bell. Soon, multiple bells around graves start to ring, but Irene manages to find Burke\u0027s coffin and she starts to dig him up. Before she can reach him, demon hands start to pull at him, but Irene manages to free him. Inside the coffin, Burke then finds a bunch of books on the occult.The next day, Burke and Irene go to the abbey, but only Irene is allowed to enter. She meets Sister Oana (Ingrid Bisu), who tells her that the nuns change shifts to pray to keep evil at bay. Oana hears about Irene seeing Valak, and Oana explains the demon\u0027s origin. When the abbey was built during the Dark Ages, a duke obsessed with the powers of Hell tried to open a rift to summon Valak, but several men found and killed the duke before Valak could fully emerge, keeping him trapped using an artifact (the same one the nuns from before were looking for) containing the blood of Christ. He remained sealed in Hell until bombs from World War II dropped around the abbey and broke the rift open, setting the demon loose. Oana explains that Valak takes the form of a nun to look like the rest of them and prey on their weaknesses. Meanwhile, Burke reads about Valak and learns his name.Frenchie is in a tavern where he hears that one of the patrons had a 12-year-old daughter that committed suicide by hanging after allegedly seeing something horrible. After Frenchie tells the bartender that he went up with Burke and Irene to the abbey, the bartender warns Frenchie that the two of them may be the next victims.Burke once again attempts to enter the abbey, only to encounter the Abbess again to tell him he won\u0027t find another way in. He tries to ask the Abbess about the key that he found with Victoria, but she tells Burke it\u0027s too late and that Irene is lost. Her body then appears to go limp. Burke tries to lift her veil to see her, but her demonic body grabs at him until he rips her hand off of him.Irene awakens after seeing another frightening vision of Valak. She wanders outside her room and is once again attacked by the demon nun. Burke hears the noise and tries to save her but he is also attacked until Frenchie shows up with a shotgun. Irene finds the other nuns and starts to pray alongside them as an evil force carves a pentagram into her back. Irene then sees what looks like Oana\u0027s dead body, but she quickly realizes that Oana and the other nuns were not real, but visions.The three reunite as they realize that Victoria was not trying to commit suicide, but rather sacrifice herself so that Valak could not possess her body and spread terror. They head into the catacombs to find the artifact with Christ\u0027s blood. Irene realizes that \"Mary points the way\" is in reference to the statue of Mary that literally points the way to where they may find the artifact. Sure enough, they come across the vial containing the blood after opening its chamber using Victoria\u0027s key. Soon, Valak reemerges and attacks the trio. He starts to try and possess Irene while Burke is attacked by the demonic Daniel. Irene is briefly possessed, but Frenchie manages to throw some blood on her to free her. Valak unleashes a dark force upon Frenchie, and then tries to drown Irene. He pulls her up and sees that the vial is broken. She spits the blood in Valak\u0027s face, sending the demon back to Hell and sealing the rift.As the trio leave the abbey, Irene asks Frenchie his real name, and he says it\u0027s Maurice. We then see an upside down cross burned into the back of Maurice\u0027s neck.The film concludes with a clip from the first \"Conjuring\" movie in the present day where Carolyn Perron (Lili Taylor) is watching Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) give a seminar on their encounter with the possessed Maurice, who later committed suicide. His contact with Lorraine caused her to see visions, and unfortunately for her, it would not be the last time that she encountered Valak.","numvotes":"135199","primarytitle":"The Nun"},"color":"rgb(65,97,106)","size":1.0},{"source":"Thriller","target":"tt0050280","id":"7230","attributes":{"notes":"Mad scientist elements; adaptation","runtimeminutes":"82","sex of killer":"male","synopsis":"The movie opens with text over a red background that reads, \"More than a hundred years ago, in a mountain village in Switzerland, lived a man whose strange experiments with the dead have since become legend. The legend is still told with horror the world over...It is the legend of...\" A clever segway into the title: The Curse of Frankenstein. Credits follow.A man on horseback approaches a prison in the mountains along a narrow pathway. A church bell chimes the hour as a man opens the gate for the rider. He is a priest (Alex Gallier). He is escorted by the Warder (Michael Mulcaster) to see Baron Victor Frankenstein (Peter Cushing). The warder explains that the prisoner is dangerous. The Baron wishes to see the priest because he thinks he can trust the man with his story. He starts his story, \"I suppose it was when I was a boy at school. I always had a brilliant intellect. When my mother died, I inherited the Frankenstein fortune.\"The Young Baron (Melvyn Hayes) is escorting his extended family out of his house after his mother died. His uncle (Raymond Ray) leads the family delegation. Aunt Sophie (Noel Hood) and her daughter, young Elizabeth (Sally Walsh) stay behind. Aunt Sophie wants reassurance her allowance will continue uninterrupted. After confirming the money will continue, Victor quickly escorts the two relatives out the door. As they are leaving, a dapper gentleman in a brown top hat arrives. Paul Krempe (Robert Urquhart) walks into the house and presents himself to the new, but very young, Baron. He had corresponded with the Baron for a tutor. Initially he thinks there must be some mistake or a joke, but Victor explains the tutoring is for himself and he is serious. The two hit it off immediately. After two years, \"I learned all he had to teach, but we went on together probing into the unknown, investigating, recording, searching, always searching until gradually the sweep of our research began to assume a single direction and to this aim we finally turned all our energies. It took us years of unrelenting work to discover what we were seeking.\" With chemical and electrical apparatus they were able to restore life to a dead puppy. Paul sees the possibilities of their discovery. He notes, \"If we could delay or prolong the period in which the body is apparently dead while the heart is alive wed have a living body with only the barest life-spark present. That what that would mean when it came to performing major surgery!\" Paul wants to write up their findings and present it at a medical conference within a month. Victor expresses his opposition because he wants to experiment further and does not want to share the secret, not yet at least. He proposes the next step. Rather than just restore life, he wants to create life from the beginning. He tells Paul, \"We must build up our own creature, and built it up from nothing. We must create a human beinga perfect human.\" Paul disagrees, \"What you\u0027re saying is nonsense, a revolt against nature. Such a thing could only end in evil.\" Victor persuades Paul to continue the work. He proposes to obtain a body, and knows a highwayman was hanged for his crimes and suggests they retrieve it. They take a horse and cart and cut down the body and return it to their lab. Paul notes that half the head has been eaten away. Victor quickly cuts the head off, explaining it is of no use. He dumps it into a vat of acid in the storage room next door. They remove the old clothes, wrap the body in bandages and place it in a large, glass tank. Now Paul voices his objection to the whole exercise, \"I don\u0027t think we should continue with this.\" Victor tells Paul he will be leaving for a while but does not explain where or why.Justine the maid (Valerie Gaunt) carries refreshments into the living room and asks Paul if the Baron has returned. She answers the door, expecting that Victor has returned. To her disappointment it is not the Baron but a woman who tells her she was expected and needs help with her luggage. Elizabeth (Hazel Court) is the Baron\u0027s cousin and we learn later his fiancée. She mistakes Paul for the Baron. Victor arrives home in an excited state calling for Paul. He is not surprised to see Elizabeth. He and Paul rush off to the lab upstairs leaving Elizabeth annoyed and confused.Victor unwraps something from a small black bag. He proudly displays two hands, cut off at the wrist. He explains they are Bardello\u0027s hands--the hands of the world\u0027s greatest sculptor. Paul voices his objection to exposing Elizabeth to the experiment. He tells Victor, \"While you were away, I decided I could not continue with this experiment.\" He tries to convince Victor to stop, but he is unsuccessful. Victor remains in the lab and will graft the new hands on by himself. Paul goes downstairs and tries to convince Elizabeth to leave. In this he is also unsuccessful, mainly because he will not explain the nature of the experiment or the danger. She explains she is to be Victor\u0027s wife.Outside the lab, Victor and Justine embrace and kiss. Victor is just toying with the maid. She believes she will be his wife, but Victor tells her that Elizabeth is to be his wife. The next morning Victor prepares to leave on another trip. Elizabeth talks to him about the household accounts and possibly assisting in other ways. Victor pays a visit to the Municipal Charnel House and buys a pair of human eyes. Victor takes them home to examine them when Paul asks to see him. He reiterates his refusal to help Victor with his work. Victor proudly shows Paul how far he has gone on his own. Paul turns away from the tank with revulsion and exclaims, \"It\u0027s horrible!\" Victor tells Paul that once a genius brain is obtained and installed the creature will take on a benevolent face. When asked where the brain will come from, Victor replies, \"I\u0027ll get it.\"Victor and Elizabeth are in the living room entertaining a visitor. Professor Bernstein (Paul Hardtmuth) accepted an invitation from the Baron for dinner and to spend the night. The professor tells Victor that discoveries can be mishandled. Paul enters the room and is introduced to the distinguished professor. Victor escorts the old man upstairs to his room. At the top of the stairs Victor shows him a painting, maneuvering the old man closer to the bannister, which gives way. Victor pushes the old man through and down to his death. Professor Bernstein is given a burial at the Baron\u0027s expense and in his family vault. Later that evening the Baron retrieves Bernstein\u0027s brain. He carefully places the jar in his bag and prepares to leave the vault. Paul arrives, expecting to find Victor and accuses him of murder. Paul intends to stop Victor from using the brain, and tells him so. They briefly struggle over the bag and the jar is broken.Paul calls on Elizabeth in her room and again begs her to leave. He explains he only stays to ensure her safety. In the lab, Victor is picking pieces of glass out of the brain, trying to salvage it. He puts the brain into the skull and prepares to revive his newly finished creature. He starts the chemical and electrical equipment as an electrical storm brews outside. Paul is upstairs in his room preparing for bed. As the tank empties, Victor goes to Paul\u0027s room and again asks for help. He admits, \"That apparatus was constructed for dual operation. You know that. I thought I could work it myself, but I can\u0027t.\" But Paul gleefully replies, \"I\u0027m delighted.\" A lightning bolt starts the electrical components and the body in the empty tank begins to breathe. Victor promises that after the experiment is completed he will dispose of the body. Paul reluctantly agrees to help. Victor returns to the lab and hears glass breaking. He unlocks the lab door and standing there is the creature. It pulls away the bandages covering its head to reveal a scarred and hideous face (Christopher Lee). One eye is blue, the other brown, and it stares at its creator with hate. It grabs Victor and chokes him. Only Paul\u0027s quick action saves Victor. He breaks a chair over the thing\u0027s head. The creature stumbles and falls to the floor. Paul demands the creature be destroyed as Victor straps it down to a table. Victor tells Paul he will operate on the brain the next morning and try to correct its homicidal tendencies. But the next morning the lab is a shambles and the window broken. The creature has broken free and escaped.Victor and Paul search the countryside for the creature. An old blind man (Fred Johnson) and his grandson (Claude Kingston) are out in the woods for a stroll. The old man sits and the grandson goes down to the lake shore to pick mushrooms. The creature encounters the old man. After a brief exchange he kills the old man. The grandson returns to where he left his grandfather. Victor and Paul find signs and follow it into the woods. They find it, and Paul shoots the creature through the eye. The creature falls and is pronounced dead. They bury it in place and return to the house.Paul goes to the lab and tells Victor he is leaving. With the creature dead, he no longer needs to stay and protect Elizabeth. But Paul doesn\u0027t know Victor dug his creation up and returned its lifeless body back to the lab. Victor stares at his creature hanging in the store room and promises, \"I\u0027ll give you life again.\" Victor is dressed and tells Justine she can serve dinner. Justine reminds Victor of his promise to marry her. Her trump card is the revelation she is pregnant with his child. He does not believe he is the father, but Justine informs the master that Elizabeth will believe her. She adds that she will go to the authorities regarding the experiment. He fires the maid and orders that she leave the next morning. That night Justine goes up to the lab to get the proof she will need for the authorities. Victor leaves the lab door unlocked and Justine enters for a look. She enters the storage room and finds the revived creature. When she tries to flee, Victor locks her in, knowing his homicidal creation will kill her. It does.A week later, Victor and Elizabeth are having breakfast. Elizabeth inquires about Justine. Victor lies and tells her, \"I expect some village lothario eloped with her.\" They discuss the wedding plans. Elizabeth reveals she invited Paul. Instead of being angry, Victor casually informs her he hopes Paul comes. He says that he has something to show Paul.It is the eve of the wedding, and a reception at the Baron\u0027s home is underway. The Burgomaster (Andrew Leigh) is enjoying the laced punch and practicing his speech. His wife (Ann Blake) reproaches her drunk husband and they leave for home. When all the guests have left, Victor announces he will be working in the lab. Elizabeth is disappointed and tells her future husband. Paul does not attend the reception, but does come later that evening. Elizabeth tells Paul to go surprise Victor. Victor is preparing a plate of flood when Paul knocks on the lab door. Victor invites his old tutor into the lab. He leads him to the storage room. Paul is shocked to discover the creature chained to the wall and showing signs of brain surgery. Victor orders the creature onto its feet. It struggles but stands, then sits when ordered. Paul chides the Baron about the creature\u0027s lack of perfection, but Victor reminds Paul, \"There you see the result of your handiwork as much as mine...but you damaged it. You put a bullet in the wretched thing. This is your fault, Paul.\" Paul exits the lab, promising to go to the authorities and have them destroy the creature. Victor chases after him. He leaves the lab door unlocked and Elizabeth enters the lab. The creature breaks its chains. Elizabeth enters the storage room and sees the vat of acid. The creature gets out onto the roof. Victor and Paul see it and Paul goes to the village for help. Elizabeth goes outside to explore a noise she heard. Victor grabs a pistol and goes out to the roof. Firing at the creature he hits Elizabeth, then the creature. Only wounded, the creature approaches Victor. A well-aimed toss of an oil lamp sets the creature ablaze. The creature falls through the skylight and straight into the acid filled vat below.We return to the prison, and the priest still listening to the story now finished. Victor concludes, \"My life\u0027s work destroyed. Destroyed in a moment. And by the same hand that gave it life.\" Paul comes to visit Victor at the prison. Elizabeth was only wounded and recovers. She is also at the prison, but stays in the waiting area. Victor begs Paul to tell the priest about the creature and to verify the story, but Paul denies it. He does accuse Victor of murdering Justine. Victor claims it was the creature who murdered the maid. The priest leaves the cell. Victor tries to kill Paul, but the jailer prevents it. Paul leaves the cell and returns to talk to Elizabeth. He takes her home. Victor is led to his execution. The last scene is of a guillotine, seen in silhouette, and the credits roll.","numvotes":"10925","primarytitle":"The Curse of Frankenstein","productioncompany":"Hammer Films","countriesoforigin":"United Kingdom","averagerating":"7.1","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"The Curse of Frankenstein","sex of artist":"male","storyline":"In prison and awaiting execution, Dr. Victor Frankenstein recounts to a priest what led him to his current circumstance.

Mother Rukh (Violet Kemble Cooper), seated in a chair, inquires whether her son Dr. Janos Rukh (Boris Karloff) is still working in his lab. Diane confirms this, saying that he is preparing for the delegation of scientists due to arrive from England. Rising from her chair with help from Diane, Mother Rukh comes to the window with her cane. She tells Diane that on a day like this her son Janos discovered the ray from Andromeda while working with his late father. It was holding the lens during that discovery which caused her permanent blindness. They discuss the brilliance of Janos and how he was rejected by other scientists and called a charlatan. Diane says she was told to watch for the headlights coming and notify Janos. Mother Rukh returns to her seat and Diane looks out the window again. Seeing the car approaching, she announces that she will go tell her husband. She dons her cape and goes through an outer walkway to another building where she rings a bell and enters. Coming into the lab, she tells Janos (who is gazing through a large telescope) that the visitors are arriving. He says he is ready and confident.The car pulls up and several people get out and enter the house. Diane greets Lady Arabella Stevens (Beulah Bondi) who introduces her husband Sir Francis Stevens (Walter Kingsford), Dr. Felix Benet (Bela Lugosi) and her nephew Ronald Drake (Frank Lawton). They are introduced to Mother Rukh who speaks but remains seated. Janos enters and greets each one and is greeted by Lady Arabella who presents her nephew Ronald who she says is a mapmaker and will be valuable to the work in Africa. Janos tells them he has a presentation to show them.In the lab, he shows his telescope, explaining and showing a device which will capture a ray from Andromeda containing pictures and information from thousands of years ago. Dr. Benet looks at Sir Francis with a knowing look of doubt between them. Janos attaches the device to the telescope and tells them to wait a few moments while he prepares the projector. Coming back from another room wearing a welding mask, he reaches into a panel and starts a series of electrical devices which give off sparks and energy. He announces he is ready. Diane leads the way to seats which are protected from dangerous rays by a new kind of barium crown glass, which is explained by Janos. He tells them about the distances the ray has traveled and turns on the projector, which is the type used in planetariums to show outer space. As he narrates, the picture shows a movement that passes our moon, Saturn, Orion and finally Andromeda. He tells Sr. Francis that he had previously predicted a meteor which struck Earth many years ago in Africa, telling him that this will prove it. As they watch, the view changes direction back toward Earth as seen from Andromeda but millions of years ago. A meteor is shown hurtling towards Earth and striking in the southern portion of Africa. Those viewing this are stunned. Various comments are made, saying this is no hoax.Back in the house, brandy is served. Sir Francis marvels at the discovery to Janos, asking when he will publish it to the scientific world. He says it is not yet ready. Sir Francis says it would be good to locate this meteor and see what it contains. Dr. Benet suggests that Janos join them in an expedition. Janos says he has no standing before their scientific congress and that he had previously been declared unorthodox and discredited. Sir Francis tells him their expedition will not be under the auspices of any scientific association. Dr. Benet says that he will be doing them an honor. Janos accepts, but Mother Rukh tells him no. She says he may make an important discovery but that it will not bring him happiness. She reminds him that Janos is not good with people but is better suited to remain with his experiments.A scientific magazine is shown that has an article about Dr. Benets expedition to Africa to recover Radium X. It mentions that Dr. Rukh has separated from the others. Meanwhile, at a camp in Nigeria, Dr. Benet shows Sir Francis how he has been healing natives by a medicine he derived from sunlight. A young native child is shown and given back to his mother. Diane sits in her tent, hot, tired and bored to death since her husband left them to go on his own expedition. She emerges from her tent only to see Lady Arabella and Ronald returning from a hunting trip. Seeing him stirs her. She turns away, not wanting to look. A conversation with Ronald and Lady Arabella about Diane reveals that they are interested in each other, but that Ronald dares not act because she is married. Meanwhile Sir Francis says he is sick of staying in Africa and will not remain for the sake of anyone.A safari group accompanying Janos arrives near a volcano when suddenly a loud buzzing and clicking sound coming from one of the boxes carried by a native frightens him. It is revealed to be a Giger counter showing the presence of radioactivity. Janos takes the machine and approaches a site giving off steam or smoke. He tells the leader to send a message back to the camp by his fastest runner. A runner is selected by the leader and Janos writes out a message, telling him to give it to Diana and wait for an answer. He says he has found what he is looking for, but not to tell anyone where they are.Antelope stew is served at the camp, but not everyone is interested in eating. Diane and Ronald avoid glances over the table at each other, but it is obvious that they are mutually interested in each other and this causes great discomfort. About this time the runner arrives and the note is given to Diane, who reads it. She reports only that Janos will not return right away but believes he is on the right track. Going to her tent, she asks the leader to meet with her and the runner. A small team is prepared to accompany her to see her husband. This is observed by Ronald, who then confronts Diane of her plans. She tells him she must go to her husband right away. He tells her hes not surprised that she wouldnt disappoint any man.Dressed in a protective suit and helmet, Janos is lowered into the volcano by rope controlled by natives. He uses a mining hammer to extract a sample of glowing, sparkling rock which he puts into a safe container. Returning to the natives, he is told they do not like the area because there are many devils. After the leader tells him they all want to leave, he tells them to watch a rock standing alone on a precipice. Loading the rock sample into a projector, he focuses it on the rock and shines the beam. The rock is disintegrated and melted before their eyes. He tells them they may leave if they want to, but threatens to turn the ray on them if they do. They beg and pledge their continued support.That night a meal is brought to Janos by one of the natives. He tells him to take the lantern inside the tent so it will not attract bugs. When the light is taken away, Janos begins glowing in his hands and face. Seeing this, the native cries out in horror. Janos sees his hands glowing and enters the tent. Turning down the lantern, he grabs a mirror and sees his face glowing. When the light is turned on, the glow cannot be seen. He remarks to himself that it has poisoned him. Sitting down on his cot to think, the dog approaches him and he reaches to pet it. The dog dies, and Janos realizes that his touch is deadly.Diane and her party arrive and she is pointed toward his tent. Seeing her coming, Janos draws the tent closed and turns out his lantern, hoping she will not enter. She notices the light go out and stops at the tent door to call him. Not wanting her to see or touch him, Janos questions why she came and tells her she must leave in the morning. She is shown a tent for her to stay the night, but is heartbroken and cries upon her cot. Janos gathers up the rock sample along with his mask and protective suit and starts out into the dark. Passing close by her tent, he hears her sobbing and pauses.Dr. Benet is shown mixing chemicals in his tent. Wearing full protective gear, Janos shows up with the runner and calls out to Benet, entering the tent. He tells Benet not to touch him, saying that he found the element and it is ten times more powerful than radium but that it has poisoned him. They step outside into the darkness and Benet witnesses Janos hands and face glowing. Confessing that his touch is deadly, they re-enter the tent. Janos asks Benet for help. Benet says there is an antidote for radium poisoning which is made from radium. Janos gives him a sample of the element and his chemical analysis which he has written down. Benet says he will begin at once to develop an antidote and that Janos can hide in a small equipment tent.Diane leaves on her way back to base camp. Meanwhile, Dr. Benet wakes Janos, and shows him in the dark that his skin no longer glows. He tells him that the antidote was given him at midnight and that the effect is only temporary. Touching his hand, he demonstrates that Janos is not lethal at this time, but cautions him that he must take doses of this daily for the rest of his life or the condition will recur and eventually kill him. Janos is given the formula on paper as well as a kit containing samples of the antidote and a syringe.Diane and Ronald have a discussion about their relationship, saying there is no point in denying it now. At this point a bell rings, calling them to supper.Natives sound jungle drums. Dr. Benet arrives at Janos camp and approaches him. When asked how Benet found him, he is told they followed the sound of the drums, which stated that a white man had found magic in the mountains. They go into the tent and Janos tells him that he has harnessed the power of the element to destroy cities. Benet asks if he can develop its power to heal and do good. Saying that will come later, he brags about his great discovery. Benet tells him that this was anticipated by himself and Sir Francis and that they must all share the discovery. Benet says Stevens is on his way to present the sample to the International Scientific Congress meeting in Paris. Janos argues that it is his discovery and says they are stealing it from him. Benet assures him that Janos will receive credit for it but reminds him they are united for a common purpose and that this element is too powerful and important to entrust to just one man. He says that Diane has taken ill and gone back to England. Janos is given a note from his wife, telling him that she believes that he no longer loves her and is now involved with someone else. Benet confirms that it is Drake. This further infuriates Janos, who tells Benet to leave before he turns the ray on him. Benet leaves.A newspaper shows that the Benet expedition has left Africa and that Dr. Rukh has returned to his lab in the Carpathian Mountains. Inside, Janos turns the ray on his mothers eyes, hoping to restore her sight. After a few moments, she confirms that she can see. She tells him he has much work to do, but he tells her he is leaving in the morning for Paris. She warns him not to go, for he will find tragedy there. In case of tragedy, he says, keep the formula which he has written down and sealed in an envelope for his mother to keep.In Paris we see Dr. Benet in his office who sees many patients, using the ray to heal. One girl has her sight restored and she and her parents rejoice. At this moment Janos arrives and Benet tells him that his discovery is helping to heal many people. Benet tells Janos that the Nobel Prize has been awarded to Janos and that all Paris is waiting to honor him. Janos says it looks like he is late again and declares that only he can correctly harness its power. Benet reminds him that is why the discovery was too important to entrust to just one man. Saying the counter-active is still working, Janos asks about Diane. He is told that she is working for Lady Arabella and that she and Ronald are in love. Benet tells him that Diane will do nothing until she hears from Janos. He replies that will happen soon enough and leaves.Wandering through the city, Janos finds a man who looks like himself and promises to help the man. About the same height and build, they go off together.Lady Arabella is seen dictating to Diane, who types onto paper. The maid comes bringing the newspaper and giving it to Arabella. She reads the headline and gives it to Diane. It shows that Dr. Rukh has been found dead, his body mutilated by the effects of the Radium X.Diane and Ronald are seen at their wedding at the Church of the Six Saints. As they are leaving, Janos watches from a distance as they get into a car to leave. He looks up at the statues of the six saints and pictures each of them as representing himself, Benet, Diane, Ronald, Arabella and Francis. Taking a room facing the church, he plots to kill each of the other five people.At the Stevens home, Arabella is talking to Benet about the marriage and noted that Sir Francis has not come down from his room. She sends the butler up to see about him. Before the butler can get halfway up the stairs, one of the maids comes screaming into his arms. He goes up to see while Arabella questions the maid. She cannot speak but only screams. Rushing back down, the butler calls for Dr. Benet to come, saying only  Sir Francis! Sir Francis!. Entering his room, they find Francis dead on his bed with a look of horror on his face. Dr. Benet asks for an ultraviolet camera which he uses to shoot pictures of Francis eyes. Developing them, he sees captured in the reflection on the mans cornea the image of Janos.The next day there is a disturbance in the square below. The landlady (May Beatty) brings Janos his breakfast and the morning paper, telling him that one of the statues was destroyed. He sees in the paper the death of Sir Francis. Gazing at the second statue, he calls the name of Lady Arabella.The next day the papers announce the death of Lady Arabella, the third death in wake of the curse of Radium X. Diane and Ronald come into the bedroom where Dr. Benet and the authorities are with the body. He tells Diane not to look and for Ronald to take her away. Then he asks to show the Chief of the Surete (Georges Renavent) some evidence. As the lights are turned out, the cover is pulled back to reveal a glowing handprint on the victims neck. Benet says it was done by someone poisoned by Radium X. Meanwhile Diane blames herself for the deaths, saying they would all still be alive if she hadnt come on the expedition and married Ronald. He tells her not to think like that, saying he will fight with all his strength. She says how can you fight something you cannot see or touch?The paper headline shows that the second statue has been destroyed and people are upset. A discussion is held with Benet, Ronald and the Chief about Janos. It is suggested that the two men go into hiding. Ronald proposes a trap to draw Janos so they can arrest him. Benet says for the papers to announce that the remaining three will leave for an unknown destination after holding a lecture on Benets experiments with Radium X. He will invite distinguished scientists who will only be admitted by card which the police promise to verify. Benet warns that if the police fail to stop him at the gate that the house lights will be darkened at midnight (the time of the lecture) so that Janos can be seen glowing. It is a risk they are willing to take.The night of the lecture, the police are seen checking the cards of each scientist who enters. In the rain the last scientist, Professor Meiklejohn (Frank Reicher) is seen walking with his umbrella. Janos appears and stops him, introducing himself as someone else who remembers his lecture on radiology. Saying he is on the way to the lecture, the Professor locates his card in his pocket. Janos suggests they have a drink of Napoleon Brandy from his flask. They step aside and the flask is handed to him to drink. The touch kills Meiklejohn, who collapses. Janos takes the card and enters in his place. The police confirm him and he enters but remains outside so he can observe through a window.Inside, Benet greets everyone and tells them he must make final adjustments. Entering his lab with a gun, Benet looks around and heads for the outside door, opening it. Janos comes in and confronts him. The light is turned off, showing his glowing face and hands. Janos tells him he will kill the remaining three. Benet asks if he ever feels like he used to before the poison altered his brain. Janos answers  not often now.. When Benet reaches for his gun, Janos grabs his arm, killing him.Diane waits upstairs but is very anxious to come down. There is a knock at the door and it is opened, revealing Mother Rukh entering. Ronald greets her and she is told that Diane is upstairs. At that moment the lights are cut in the whole place. Diane lights a candle and Janos is seen going upstairs with his glowing face. She rushes into the bedroom and tries to close the door but he forces it open. He approaches to try and touch her but hesitates. Trying again, he announces he is unable to kill her and goes out. She faints. Outside on the landing, he faces his mother who tells him he broke the first rule of science. He says he needs time so he can kill Drake, taking out his kit for more of the antidote. As he does this, Mother Rukh strikes it with her cane tip, destroying the contents. As he begins to smoke, he tells her that maybe its better this way. Turning away, he goes upstairs and crashes through a window, falling to the ground below as a fireball. There is nothing left. The head of the Scientific Congress congratulates Mother Rukh for her sons work. Handing him the envelope, she says that he is dead but part of him will continue to help mankind.","numvotes":"2517","primarytitle":"The Invisible Ray"},"color":"rgb(119,86,100)","size":2.0},{"source":"Drama","target":"tt0005615","id":"7028","attributes":{"productioncompany":"Ocean Film Corporation","countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"6.6","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"Life Without Soul","sex of artist":"male","storyline":"A young man gives life to a statue with disastrous results.","startyear":"1915","runtimeminutes":"70","role of artist":"protagonist","numvotes":"53","primarytitle":"Life Without Soul"},"color":"rgb(92,73,83)","size":3.0},{"source":"body in art","target":"tt0098054","id":"6957","attributes":{"runtimeminutes":"104","sex of killer":"male","numvotes":"243","primarytitle":"Paint It Black","productioncompany":"Vestron Pictures","countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"4.8","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"Paint It Black","sex of artist":"male","storyline":"A serial killer covers his victims in modeling clay, and a local sculptor is accused of the crimes.","startyear":"1989","role of artist":"victim"},"color":"rgb(106,93,97)","size":3.0},{"source":"Comedy","target":"tt8108202","id":"7050","attributes":{"productioncompany":"D2R Films","countriesoforigin":"India","averagerating":"7.6","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"Stree","storyline":"Chanderi village is haunted for years by a witch whose called as Stree.

When another nun tries to get her to come down, Maureen accidentally pushes her over the railing to her death. Another nun tells Maureen that she will burn in hell for what she did. She is forced to leave the convent after this ordeal.She walks through the desert for a while, and finally reaches a highway. A beat-up car approaches and passes her, but backs up upon seeing her. The driver, Duane Duke (Jeff Fahey) offers her a ride. She puts her suitcase in the backseat and in doing so, bumps his guitar. He tells her to be careful with it, because it is his \"bread and butter\"--he is on his way to Los Angeles to make it big as a rock-n\u0027-roll singer. She says that she\u0027s having car problems, and that the problem is that there is no car.They continue driving into the night during a heavy rainstorm. Duane can barely see ahead of him but keeps on driving aggressively, and the car begins to weave between the lanes. The car is having engine problems, and a loud popping sound causes Duane to swerve the car to the other side of the road. Duane pulls the car off the road, and tells Maureen that they aren\u0027t going any further, due to the storm. He advises her to try to get some sleep. During the middle of the night, it is still raining, and Duane makes a pass at her. She struggles to fight him off, and slaps his face. She gets out of the car, and he angrily tosses her suitcase out into a muddy puddle. Duane drives off, leaving Maureen sobbing.The next morning at the Bates Motel, Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) collects some dead birds in a paper sack from the ground, thanks to some poisoned birdseed he kept in a birdfeeder, and stuffs them in the kitchen using his taxidermy supplies. On the table is a newspaper opened up to an article entitled, \"Spool Still Missing.\" Norman has a flashback of him killing Emma Spool (Claudia Bryar, from the end of Psycho II), and when he looks down at the bird he is stitching up, he instead sees a hand and arm being stitched together! He is startled when the paper sack moves along the tabletop by itself, and is relieved to see a healthy bird pop out. Norman carefully grasps the bird in his hands and releases it outside. He hears a car horn blaring, and comes down to meet Duane. Duane is interested in the \"help wanted\" sign posted on the office window. Norman offers him a job as an assistant manager for the motel, and Duane accepts, mentioning that he only wants to stay long enough to earn money to fix his car to go to L.A.Norman goes off to the diner (Statlers) where he used to work to get some food. At the diner, Ralph Statler (Robert Alan Browne)--the owner--is having a conversation with Sheriff John Hunt (Hugh Gillin) about Emma Spool. He is confused as to why she would suddenly not show up for work a month ago and disappear, after normally being a stellar employee since he took over the diner from the previous owner, Harvey Leach (Hugo L. Stanger) seven years earlier. --Sheriff Hunt says that her apartment has been searched and nothing seems out of the ordinary. Ralph hopes that nothing serious has happened to her, displaying a worried look on his face. Tracy Veneble (Roberta Maxwell), a nosy magazine reporter, chimes in and suggests that Norman may have had something to do with her disappearance. She came from L.A. to interview Norman about the subject of the insanity defense and the rehabilitation of mentally ill murderers.Sheriff Hunt and Ralph argue with her and tell her to leave him alone in peace. Just then, Norman walks in and sits down in a booth. He orders a meal and gets an order of burgers to go. Tracy sits down across from him and starts to ask him some questions. He opens up to her and explains that what happened to him in the past stays with him and he can\u0027t escape the reality of what he did. As they are talking, Maureen gets out of a semi truck and comes into the diner. Norman is horrified to see her initials on her suitcase--\"M.C.\" Norman has a flashback to the murder of Marion Crane from 22 years earlier-he notices that Maureen is almost an exact look-alike to Marion. He pays for the food and quickly leaves while Tracy keeps droning on and on.Back at the motel, Duane sees an exhausted Maureen walking toward the highway. He apologizes to her for his behavior the night before (he says he was road-weary) and offers her a motel room that she can rest in. She pays him $25 for the room, and he gives her the key to cabin #1. As she leaves, Duane keeps the $5 bill she gave him, folds over the edge of one corner, and puts it in his pocket. Norman walks by and sees her going into the room. He freaks out and goes back to the house. Norman has a conversation with \"Mother (Virginia Gregg\u0027s voice),\" the stuffed corpse of Mrs. Spool. He tells \"her\" about Maureen resembling Marion, and \"she\" tells him to get rid of her if her presence upsets him. He refuses, and Mother says that maybe she will do it instead.Maureen unpacks her suitcase in cabin 1. She sees a copy of the Bible on the nightstand, and she has a traumatic memory of her actions at the convent. She starts to cry. In Fairvale, Duane goes into a bar and sees Tracy Veneble. He introduces himself to her and lights her cigarette for her. She initially is turned off by him, but when she sees his Bates Motel matchbook, she decides to have a talk with him.In the motel office parlor, Norman takes a picture off the wall, and looks through a peephole into cabin 1. He sees Maureen stripping and going into the bathroom nude. Norman goes back up to the house and puts on his \"Mother\" costume and goes back to cabin 1 to kill her. Maureen is in the shower, and \"Mother\" pulls back the shower curtain. Maureen is sitting in a tub of rising bloody water. A razor blade sits nearby. She lifts up her hands to reveal that her wrists were slit, with blood gushing out of the wounds. Due to her blood loss, Maureen hallucinates that \"Mother\" is the Virgin Mary coming to save her.Meanwhile, Duane and Tracy continue talking about Norman. Tracy says she will pay Duane for any information he gives her. Unexpectedly, she gets up and leaves. Duane notices a red-haired girl (Juliette Cummins) staring at him.At St. Matthew\u0027s Hospital, Maureen is in a room recovering from her suicide attempt. Father Brian (Gary Bayer), a psychiatrist, is sitting by her bedside and introduces himself to her. Outside her room, Norman and Sheriff Hunt are waiting. Tracy shows up and claims that she happened to be passing by the motel and saw the ambulance leaving and decided to follow it. She asks how Norman found out about Maureen. Sheriff Hunt chimes in and says he was bringing fresh towels to Maureen\u0027s motel room when he found her in the bathtub after she cut her wrists and he used her room phone to call for an ambulance, repeating what Norman had told him. Father Brian comes out and tells Norman that Maureen wants to see him.Maureen thanks Norman for finding her and calling for help. He is just glad that he was looking out for someone else. He tells her that she can stay at the motel for free as long as she wants until she gets better and can sort her life out. He leaves her room to let her rest, and goes back home. He accuses Mother of hurting Maureen, and says that he is glad that Maureen didn\u0027t die. Mother replies, \"She will!\"Duane brings the red-haired girl back to the motel. They overhear Norman yelling at Mother. They just assume the noise is due to a loud TV. Red tries to open the ice chest next to the office to get some ice, but it is locked. She bumps into Norman and falls to the ground. He opens the chest for her and she gets some ice and asks him to join her and Duane; he politely declines.Red and Duane make love, and later she comes out of the shower. She goes over to Duane to kiss some more and he isn\u0027t interested anymore. She is upset because she wants this relationship to be more than just a one-night fling, and he tells her to leave and gives her $5 for cab fare, the same $5 that Maureen used to help pay for cabin #1. He tosses her and her clothes out the door. She puts her clothes on and goes into to a phone booth nearby to call for a cab. She realizes she put her shirt on backward and takes it off to put it back on correctly. Suddenly, Mother\u0027s hand bursts through the glass door, opens it, and stabs her over and over again. Red struggles to fight off Mother\u0027s attack, and she severely cuts the bottoms of her bare feet from stumbling on the glass shards on the floor, blood squishing out. Red crumples to the ground and Mother turns around and leaves. Back at the house, Norman cries, \"Mother! Oh God, Mother! Blood! Blood!\"The next morning, Duane comes out of his cabin and sees Norman scrubbing the glass walls of the phone booth with soapy water. Duane goes into the office and sees that the $5 bill he gave Red for cab fare is in the cash drawer.At the hospital, Maureen is having a counseling session with Father Brian. She tells him that it was her idea to become a nun, but that as the time grew close to take her final vows of celibacy, she became scared and was dwelling on lustful thoughts. Father Brian asks her why she didn\u0027t just leave the novitiate, rather than be tormented by those thoughts.Duane talks to Tracy at the motel about the $5 bill he discovered in the drawer. She tells him it may have helped solve the mystery if he knew the girl\u0027s name. The motel is bustling with activity because Fairvale\u0027s homecoming football game is later in the day, and several guests have checked into rooms. Norman and Maureen arrive in a cab, and he sees Tracy going up to the house. She wants to continue her interview with him, but he stops her and tells her to leave and never come back. Norman goes into cabin 1, and Maureen is pleased to find that Norman had her wet clothes sent to the dry-cleaner\u0027s. He tells her that she\u0027ll look good in her pink dress on their dinner date later on.At Mrs. Spool\u0027s apartment, Tracy talks with the landlord. He says that other than coming and going for work, Mrs. Spool stayed home. The landlord leaves, and Tracy decides to stay and snoop for a while. She glances at some magazines on a coffee table and a single phone number is written on the covers several times. She dials the number on the phone, and she discovers that it connects her to the Bates Motel.That evening, Norman takes Maureen out to eat at a fancy restaurant in Fairview. After eating, they get up to dance. At first, Maureen doesn\u0027t feel comfortable, but Norman teaches her the basic \"box\" step movements.Back at the motel, a cab drops Maureen and Norman off. Maureen goes into her room, and Norman follows soon after. He sees her staring toward the house. He asks her what is wrong, and she says that she must have had too much to drink--she thought she saw a woman up in the window at the house. Uncomfortable, Norman goes to tell Duane that he can take off for the night, and then goes back to Maureen. She tells him she enjoyed her time with him earlier. They lay down on the bed and kiss. Norman stops kissing her, and he says he doesn\u0027t feel right about this. Maureen eases his discomfort by suggesting they just lie on the bed and hold each other.Later that night, Maureen is asleep and Norman is gone. Patsy Boyle (Katt Shea Reuben), a guest from another cabin, comes in to wake her and warns her about the door being left wide open. She tells Maureen that she\u0027ll close it for her, in case one of her drunk friends might happen to wander inside.Up at the house, Mother scolds Norman for letting Maureen come between them. She starts whispering something to him, and he is about to put on the dress and wig. Maureen comes up to the front door and calls out his name. Mother tells him to bring her the knife. He is shocked to see her dead body sit up in bed. Norman takes the knife in his hand, wraps his fingers around the blade, and slams his hand down on a table. He yelps in pain. Concerned, Maureen asks what is wrong. He feigns ill, and tells her to go back to her cabin and lock her door. Soon after, Norman leaves, dressed to kill.Meanwhile, Patsy Boyle is looking for a bathroom to use. She sees the one in the parlor, and sits down on the toilet to relieve herself. Suddenly, she looks up in surprise and sees Mother standing directly in front of her. She tells Mother that the bathroom is \"occupied,\" and Mother thrusts the knife, slitting her throat, and stabbing her in the stomach. Patsy keels over and falls to the floor. Later, Norman goes into the parlor looking for Duane, and he recoils in shock from seeing the bloody mess. Norman takes her body out of the bathroom and tosses it out the window behind the motel. Some partiers are chasing each other around the building, and Norman hides himself and the body momentarily. The guests all get into their cars and leave, burning rubber on their way out to the highway.The next morning, Maureen comes out of her cabin to see the sheriff\u0027s car outside. Worried, she asks about Norman. Tracy is there too, and she decides it\u0027s time to tell Maureen the truth about Norman. Sheriff Hunt and Deputy Leo (Steve Guevara) are investigating the disappearance of Patsy Boyle. She didn\u0027t ride home with the other revelers, and they go up to the house where they question Norman about it. Norman figures that Tracy assumed he was involved. Deputy Leo searches the first floor level, and then goes to search upstairs. Terrified that they\u0027ll discover Mrs. Spool\u0027s corpse, Norman runs up after him, with Sheriff Hunt in pursuit. Norman sees that there is no body in Mother\u0027s room. Bewildered by Norman\u0027s antics, Hunt and Leo leave.Shortly after, Norman is sitting by the ice machine by the motel. Sheriff Hunt apologizes to Norman for their intrusion, and he opens the ice chest to grab a couple of ice cubes to suck on. There are human fingers sticking up out of the ice, but he doesn\u0027t see them. He puts bloody ice cubes in his mouth (he doesn\u0027t notice this-he grabs them without looking at them) and vehemently ignores Tracy\u0027s pleas to take Norman in for questioning about the disappearances of Mrs. Spool and Patsy, because there is no proof that he did anything. Maureen lies to Hunt, and claims that she was with Norman until 6:00 that morning, so he couldn\u0027t have done anything wrong. Hunt and Leo leave, and Tracy waits for Maureen to get in her car--she told her everything about Norman, and Maureen tells a disappointed Norman that she\u0027ll stay with Father Brian for a while. They drive off.Norman looks around the house looking for Mother. She is nowhere to be found. In the kitchen, he sees a note from Mother: \"Norman--I\u0027m in cabin 12. Come see me.\" Norman walks along the front of the motel and approaches cabin 12, which is Duane\u0027s cabin. On the TV is a Woody Woodpecker cartoon. Mother is sitting in front of the TV. On the bed, Duane--high on drugs and alcohol--plays his guitar.\"What are you doing with my mother?\" Norman asks him.Duane replies, \"Don\u0027t you mean, Mummy?\" in a mocking tone. Norman asks him why he took her and left the note for him to find.\"I\u0027m just looking out for you Norman,\" says Duane.\"And yourself,\" Norman says.Duane continues, \"I have ambitions--dreams, but dreams don\u0027t come cheap these days. I could\u0027ve turned \u0027mom\u0027 over to the cops this afternoon, but all I would\u0027ve gotten was a pat on the back for doing my civic duty.\" He tells her that Tracy would\u0027ve payed him a big sum of money, but figures that she would lie and take all the credit and earn a big salary and earn a news position somewhere.Duane blackmails Norman into selling the house and motel in order to give Mother over to Norman. Norman tells him that he wants Mother back. Duane tells him he can take her--Duane says, \"You know what I want, and you know what I\u0027ll do if I don\u0027t get it.\"Norman hits Duane in the head with an ashtray. A violent fight breaks out with Norman hitting Duane with a lamp, and ultimately, hitting Duane with his own guitar. \"Watch the guitar,\" Duane mumbles. Norman hits him with the guitar repeatedly, until the guitar is broken into several pieces. Duane crumples to the floor, unconscious.At the diner, Ralph, Myrna (Lee Garlington)--a waitress, and Tracy are discussing Mrs. Spool. Ralph tells Tracy that Mrs. Spool was a good employee, and was already working there when Ralph bought the place. Tracy asks about the diner\u0027s former owner, Harvey Leach, in the hopes that she can find out more about Mrs. Spool from him. Myrna says that Harvey is in a nursing home outside of town. Tracy visits Harvey, and she asks him about Mrs. Spool. He tells her that Emma had been put in an asylum for killing someone.At Father Brian\u0027s office, Maureen has decided to forgive Norman and wants to be back with him. She has failed other people before, but she won\u0027t fail him.At a library, Tracy looks through old archived newspaper articles, and is shocked to see a headline reading: \"Sister arrested in Bates Murder-Kidnapping.\" Below it is a sub-heading: \"Child Unharmed in Love Triangle Tragedy.\"In Duane\u0027s motel room, Norman removes his belongings and wraps his body in the shower curtain. \"I\u0027ll be back for you mother,\" Norman says. Norman opens the ice chest and tries to remove Patsy\u0027s body from it. One of her arms is wedged against the top of the chest and won\u0027t move, and Norman tries with all his strength to pull it loose, but the arm snaps off. He finally gets the body out of the ice chest, and he kisses her on the lips before putting her in the trunk of Duane\u0027s car. Norman puts Duane\u0027s body in the back seat of the car and drives it over to the swamp. On the way, Duane wakes up and wraps a cord around Norman\u0027s neck. Startled, Norman slams his foot down on the brake pedal and the momentum causes Duane to lurch forward into the front passenger seat.Norman pins Duane down on the floor of the car with his foot, and the other foot accidentally presses down on the gas pedal, sending the car into the swamp. As the car fills with water, Norman sees Duane drowning. Norman manages to escape the flooding car and swims away from it. He struggles to see in the murky water, navigating through underwater weeds. He lets out a scream when he sees Red\u0027s body--her pale, expressionless face staring back at him. He surfaces, and crawls his way out of the swamp.Meanwhile, Tracy shows copies of the newspaper articles to Father Brian, hoping that if Maureen would see them, she could change her story to the police. He tells her Maureen already left and went back to the motel.In her room, Maureen has showered and put on a nightgown. She hears Norman running up the steps to the house, and she calls out to him. He ignores her and runs into the house. She walks up to the house and enters it. As she walks up the staircase, she calls out to Norman again and explains that she has returned. She says that she never should have left and she forgives him for what happened to him in the past, and emphasizes that he saved her life. Norman appears at the top of the stairs. She asks him what happened. He lies and says that he slipped in the mud.She says that she regrets hurting him by leaving, and asks for his forgiveness. They hold each other\u0027s hands and have a brief tender moment. Suddenly, Mother yells, \"Norman!\" Surprised by this, Norman lets go of Maureen\u0027s hands, sending her falling backward down the stairs, arms flailing. At the bottom of the stairs, her skull is pierced by the arrow of the cupid statue against the wall. She crumples to the floor... dead. Norman, in shock, runs down the stairs and sees that blood is pooling around her head. He angrily yells \"Mother!!\" at the top of his lungs.Tracy drives up to the motel, and, carrying a tire iron, checks Maureen\u0027s cabin. She overhears Mother saying to Norman, \"You get that whore out of my house. Throw it out in the muck and filth where she belongs!\" Norman says, \"I\u0027ll get you for this, Mother.\" Mother replies back, \"You haven\u0027t got the guts, boy!\"Tracy goes up to the house and tries to open the front door, but it\u0027s locked. She goes around the back and enters the kitchen. She slowly walks through the hallway into the foyer, and sees the living room lit up with dozens of candles. She sees Maureen\u0027s body laying on the couch, with a lit candle positioned in her grasped hands. With pity, she says, \"You dumb, stupid naive girl.\" She turns around and is shocked to see Norman dressed up as Mother, his mouth fixed in a wide, skeletal smile. \"Why can\u0027t you leave my poor son, my Norman, alone?\" says Mother. Tracy drops the tire iron and tries to escape from him. She begins to go up the stairs, with Norman slowly in pursuit.\"What set you off again, Norman? Was it Mrs. Spool? You killed her, didn\u0027t you? What did she do--come to you and tell you she was your mother? She was crazy, Norman--she wasn\u0027t your mother, and neither are you!\" She reaches the tops of the stairs, Norman still following her. \"Mrs. Spool was your aunt, Norman. She was in love with your father, but your mother stole him away from her! Emma Spool killed your father in a jealous rage and kidnapped you when you were just a baby!\" In Mother\u0027s room, she turns around and lets out a horrified shriek when she sees Mrs. Spool\u0027s corpse sitting in a chair. \"She killed your father because she thought you were her child--the child she should have had with him! She was crazy--they locked her away!\"Mother says, \"It\u0027s lies! It\u0027s all lies! She\u0027s a lying whore. She\u0027s a slut! Don\u0027t let her talk about me like that!\" Norman, seemingly free of Mother\u0027s spell, takes off the wig and dress. \"Get her boy, get her! Just like all the others!\" continues Mother. Norman raises the knife, and it looks as though he is going to attack Tracy, but instead, Norman stabs Mrs. Spool\u0027s body at the neck. \"Norman! Can\u0027t you do anything right?\" says Mother. Norman continues hacking at the neck, with sawdust spraying out. \"How dare you treat your mother that way!\" The corpse slides out of the chair and onto the floor. Norman hacks with the knife until the head is completely severed and rolls to the side. \"So I don\u0027t have the guts, huh?\" taunts Norman. Exhausted, Norman rests his head on the chair.The next morning, Sheriff Hunt leads Norman away from the house in handcuffs. A TV news crew is there filming. Tracy and Father Brian are both in shock. Hunt is in total disbelief with Norman, telling him that he believed in him and had faith in him and now that Norman, as \"Mother\" killed more people. He puts Norman in the back of the squad car, and tells him, \"You\u0027ll never get out again! They\u0027ll lock you up forever!\" In response, Norman replies, \"But I\u0027ll be free. I\u0027ll finally be free.\"As the squad car drives along the highway, Norman reaches into his jacket pocket and pulls out a victory trophy: the severed rotting hand of Mrs. Spool. He gently caresses it as he smiles as the image fades to black.","numvotes":"14400","primarytitle":"Psycho III"},"color":"rgb(65,97,106)","size":1.0},{"source":"Fantasy","target":"tt0054240","id":"7206","attributes":{"productioncompany":"Astra Productions","countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"2.9","titletype":"movie","notes":"Orientalism; other arts more important","originaltitle":"Orgy of the Dead","storyline":"Bob and his girlfriend Shirley go in search of a cemetery in order to inspire John for writing his next horror story.

Tied to stakes and forced to watch the dancing, they await their fate. —Ed Sutton \u003cesutton@mindspring.com\u003e","startyear":"1965","runtimeminutes":"92","synopsis":"The film opens to two muscle-bound men dressed in loincloths approaching a crypt. They open the doors, revealing a coffin. They remove the lid and exit the crypt, then the inhabitant of the coffin (Criswell) sits up to deliver an opening narration.The opening credits feature the image of \"an immobile young woman clad in gold\". The image was probably inspired by a memorable scene of Goldfinger (1964).Following the credits, the camera shifts to a lone Chevrolet Corvair driving down a California desert road. Its passengers Bob (William Bates) and Shirley (Pat Barrington) are arguing over the decision to use this night to search for a cemetery. Bob is a horror writer who hopes that the scene of a cemetery at night will bring him inspiration. The conversation ends when Bob accidentally drives the car off the road and over a cliff. The next scene opens to a nocturnal image of a fog-shrouded cemetery. The lonely figure of the Emperor (Criswell) walks towards a marble altar, sits, and then summons his \"Princess of the Night\", the Black Ghoul (Fawn Silver), who appears and bows before him. The Emperor warns that if the night\u0027s entertainment fails to please him, he will banish the souls of the entertainers to eternal damnation, indicating that he is an all-powerful demonic being.As the full moon appears, the Black Ghoul summons the first dancer of the night, a Native American woman (Bunny Glaser). The Black Ghoul explains that this woman loved flames, and that both she and her lovers died in flames. The woman dances and strips before the flames of the cemetery. The Black Ghoul then introduces the second dancer of the night, a street walker in life. While the woman dances, Bob and Shirley make their way to the cemetery and start observing the dance from a distance. Shirley suspects that they are observing a college initiation, though Bob seriously doubts her theory.The Emperor himself summons the third dancer, a woman who worshiped gold above else. The Golden Girl (Pat Barrington) dances in her turn, and the Emperor instructs his loin-clothed servants to reward her with gold. The supposed reward is soon revealed to be a punishment, as the servants place her in a cauldron with liquid gold. What emerges from the cauldron is a golden statue of the living woman who entered. The servants transport the immobile statue to a nearby crypt.At this point, a werewolf (John Andrews) and mummy (Louis Ojena) appear and seize the intruding young couple. They are brought before the Emperor who decides to postpone deciding their fate. The intruders are tied up, side by side, and allowed to continue watching the dances. The Black Ghoul next introduces the fourth dancer, a \"Cat Woman\" (Texas Starr). She is depicted as a woman dressed in a leopard costume, which exposes her chest area. As she dances, a servant follows her around and thrashes her with a bullwhip. Offering a sadomasochistic show for the spectators.The Emperor next calls for a Slave Girl (Nadejda Dobrev) to be whipped for his amusement. The slave wears a tunic and is chained to a wall. Following her torture session, the Slave Girl breaks free and becomes the fifth dancer of the night. Later, the Black Ghoul exhibits a fascination with Shirley and scratches a mark on her. She draws a knife and seems about to kill Shirley, when the Emperor decides it is not yet time for the intruders to properly join them. The female ghoul reluctantly obeys.The Emperor is puzzled when a human skull appears instead of the next dancer. The Black Ghoul explains it is the symbol of the sixth dancer, who loved bullfighting and matadors. She used to dance over their demise, and now it\u0027s time to dance over her own. The dancer of apparent Spanish/Mexican heritage (Stephanie Jones) appears to perform. The Emperor and Ghoul briefly discuss the past of the dancer, who came to them on the Day of the Dead.The seventh dancer appears dressed in Polynesian garments. The Black Ghoul describes her as a worshiper of snakes, smoke, and flames. A rattlesnake is depicted along with her dance. The camera shifts to the mummy and the werewolf. The mummy voices his dislike of snakes and recalls the death of Cleopatra. He informs his companion that ancient Egypt had many snakes and they were the stuff of nightmares.   The Emperor next expresses his boredom and demands \"unusual\" entertainment, while the Black Ghoul notes that the night is almost over. She reminds her superior that they will be gone at the first sight of the morning sun. They proceed to argue over the fate of Shirley.The argument ends with the introduction of the eighth dancer (Barbara Nordin), a woman who murdered her husband on their wedding night. She dances with the skeleton of her spouse. The argument over Shirley then resumes, as the Ghoul claims her for her own. The Emperor feels the need to assert his own authority over the Black Ghoul.The ninth dancer (Dene Starnes) was a zombie in life and remains zombie-like in death. The tenth and final dancer (Rene De Beau) is introduced as one who died for feathers, fur, and fluff. She starts her dance in clothing matching this style. When the final dance ends, the Emperor finally offers Shirley to the Ghoul. The Ghoul briefly dances herself as she prepares to claim her prize. But dawn arrives and with it sunlight. The Emperor and all his undead are reduced to bones.The final scene has Bob and Shirley waking up at the scene of the accident, surrounded by paramedics, suggesting it was all a dream. Criswell appears in his coffin to offer parting words to the audience.","numvotes":"2955","primarytitle":"Orgy of the Dead"},"color":"rgb(76,80,97)","size":1.0},{"source":"Comedy","target":"tt0433969","id":"6918","attributes":{"runtimeminutes":"78","sex of killer":"male","numvotes":"287","primarytitle":"Dead Doll","productioncompany":"Shot LLC","countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"4.0","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"Dead Doll","sex of artist":"male","storyline":"Some feelings never die.

Carol, their very young daughter, is in bed right in the next room, but she is awake. Heartbroken, Lucy suffers a moment of fury and confusion that leads her to spontaneously pick up a nearby axe and decapitate her husband and his lover while they sleep. Carol watches in terror and shock as Lucy hacks the two bodies to pieces. Lucy is declared insane and sent to an asylum, where she endures traumatic shock treatments for her mental breakdown.The narrator of the flashback is revealed to be Carol, now a young woman. It is twenty years later, and Carol is opening up about her past to her boyfriend, Michael Fields. After Lucy\u0027s incarceration, Carol was taken in by her aunt and uncle, Bill and Emily, and the family lives on a farm in a rural location. Carol is revealing the family history to Michael because Lucy is being released from the asylum, and is coming to live with the family. When Lucy arrives, she is skittish. She cautiously acclimates to the farm, exploring the area with Carol and meeting the gritty-looking farm hand, Krause. But she is clearly thrilled to see Carol again, and is touched by the lovely young woman Carol has become. Carol is a sculptress and has a spacious studio filled with her work, and she thrills Lucy by giving her a bust of herself just as she was in her youth.Things quickly start to get strange. Carol shocks Lucy by presenting her with two bracelets she used to wear when she was a young woman, large dangling charm bracelets that jangle when she walks. Carol seems intent on recreating Lucy as a young woman, taking her clothes shopping and buying her a wig that mimics the hairstyle she wore the last time Carol saw her. Lucy is uncomfortable with this, but agrees to dress this way to please her daughter, whom she desperately wants to make amends with. While they are in the wig shop, Lucy hears strange voices, as if children are singing a morbid nursery rhyme about her crimes. She dismisses it as nerves. Later, she suffers a terrible nightmare and wakes up to discover two bloody heads in bed with her, with a bloody axe lying nearby. When she wakes the others, the items are gone from her room. Lucy starts to think she is relapsing.Things get worse when Carol attempts to introduce Michael to her mother. When Michael stops by for drinks, Lucy seems to try and seduce him, all with Carol right there in the room. The embarassing scene is interrupted by Lucy\u0027s former psychiatrist, Dr. Anderson, who makes an unexpected visit. When he sees how unstable Lucy seems, Dr. Anderson makes comments to the family that suggest he would like to take Lucy back to the hospital. When the doctor gets Lucy alone, his comments upset her and she runs off. As Dr. Anderson searches for her around the farm, he enters the darkened barn and a shadowy figure corners him--it appears to be Lucy, the silhouette revealing her hairstyle and figure, right down to the jangling bracelets she wears. The figure is holding an axe, and quickly decapitates Dr. Anderson.Carol returns to the farmhouse to find her mother alone in the darkened living room. The doctor\u0027s car is still outside, and Carol quickly comes to the conclusion that her mother has killed him. In a panic, Carol drives the doctor\u0027s car into a barn and locks it in, but she is spotted by Krause, who is lurking the shadows. The next day, Carol sees Krause painting the car a different color and angrily confronts him, but he smugly suggests that he knows what happened to the doctor, and that he\u0027ll turn Lucy in to the authorities if Carol fires him. Lucy overhears the conversation from the window. Later that evening, Krause is stalked and murdered with the axe.Lucy prepares for an evening that she dreads, a dinner party intended to introduce her to Michael\u0027s parents. If Michael and Carol are to be married, these will be their in-laws, and Michael\u0027s family is very wealthy, his father being the proprietor of a very successful dairy farm. Lucy has a panic attack in the powder room while at the Fields\u0027--after spilling coffee on her dress, she retreats to the washroom and suffers a flashback because of the wallpaper, which resembles the bars of a prison cell. Carol calms her down and takes her back to the party. Mr. \u0026 Mrs. Fields are cordial until they plot to get Lucy alone so they can have a private conversation with her: Mrs. Fields is suspicious of Lucy, and poor Lucy makes a terrible misstep by revealing to Mr. \u0026 Mrs. Fields that her daughter and Michael are planning to be married. The Fields had not been informed of this yet, and they react disapprovingly. Mrs. Fields in particular gets very haughty with Lucy, making suggestions about her past, and Lucy suddenly snaps at her, revealing that she was in an asylum for twenty years. She says that under no circumstances will she allow the Fields\u0027 to interfere with her daughter\u0027s happiness, and she storms out of the house.Michael drives Emily and Carol back to their house while he and Bill go out looking for Lucy, who has disappeared. Emily sends Carol to bed, but Carol is restless and cannot sleep. With Michael gone from the Fields\u0027 house, Mr. and Mrs. Fields are alone in their house and they hear sounds to suggest someone is prowling around. Mr. Fields is oblivious, but when he goes into his closet to get undressed for the evening, he is attacked by the figure of Lucy, brandishing an axe. Mrs. Fields becomes suspicious and goes looking for her husband, eventually finding his body in the dressing room. Horrified, she retreats, only to be confronted by the figure of Lucy in the bedroom. Before the axe can fall, the bedroom door opens and the real Lucy comes in; after scuffling with the other figure, Lucy tears off a mask to reveal her daughter\u0027s face underneath. Carol has been committing the murders while dressing as her mother; scarred by witnessing the double homicide committed by her mother, Carol\u0027s mind was unstable ever since. Certain that Mr. and Mrs. Fields would never allow Michael to marry her without a great deal of trouble, she plotted to make it appear as if Lucy murdered them in a rage, which would send Lucy back to the asylum and allow her to marry Michael. Her mind shattered, Carol clutches the mask of her mother and screams at it \"I hate you! I hate you! Oh I\u0027m sorry, I love you! I hate you! I love you!\" Outside on the porch, Lucy hears her daughter\u0027s insane ravings and weeps, perhaps remembering her own moment of insanity.An epilogue reveals Lucy discussing her plans with Bill.

Marc Stevens (Laurent Lucas) prepares his make-up for a performance. On stage in a hall lit by fluoerescent lights, he sings a love song to his elderly audience who appear captivated. At the end of the song, they applaud enthusiastically. He wishes them a happy new year whilst he is away.Returning to his dressing room, an old lady knocks at the door. He invites her in and he removes his make-up. She explains how much everyone loves him and asks if she may do something. He accepts and she takes his hand and places it between her legs. He pulls his hand away. She leaves in a hurry, saying how foolish she\u0027s been.As he loads his van, a woman (possibly the manager of the old-folks home, it\u0027s not clear) insists on a hug before he leaves. He does so, but the old woman from the dressing room appears at a window, so brushes her off before having trouble starting his van.He drives through the countryside on a main road and onto progressively narrower roads ending up on a track through some misty woods. He stops to check a map and sees a sign indicating \"Bartel Inn, 3km\". Continuing slowly through the heavy rain and the dark, a shadow runs in front of the van, he brakes suddenly and the engine stalls. The van will not restart. He checks under the bonnet and returns to the driver\u0027s seat to take his mobile telephone out of the glovebox. The pale face of a young man (Jean-Luc Couchard) appears at the window and asks where his dog, \"Bella\", is. Marc indicates the direction that the shadow moved. The young man heads off, but Marc calls him back and asks to be guided to the inn. They leave the van. As they head off, the young man, Boris, asks him to be quiet so he can listen out for Bella.Boris takes him to the inn and calls up to the owner, M.Bartel (Jackie Berroyer). When the old man\u0027s face appears at the window, Boris says that he has brought someone to stay then runs off into the night. M.Bartel says that nobody has stayed in ages, but the rooms are clean.The next morning, Marc is woken by the sound of a tractor. He looks out of the window of his room to see his van being towed into the courtyard. M.Bartel greets him as Marc comes outside. He offers to take a look at the van for him. Bartel explains that he used to be a comedian. Marc takes out his mobile phone but it appears not to be working. Bartel takes an interest in it. Marc asks to use Bartel\u0027s phone. Bartel makes a call to the local mechanic and appears to speak to the mechanic\u0027s wife. There will be a delay. Bartel makes a meal for Marc. Later, Marc sees Bartel working on his van. Marc offers to help, but Bartel says he\u0027ll be fine. Marc says he\u0027s going for a walk. Bartel warns him to stay away from the village. Marc asks why, but Martel stumbles over his words.Whilst Marc is out, Bartel breaks into the back of the van and takes a look at Marc possessions, ending up in the glovebox. He takes Marc\u0027s mobile phone. He comes across some documents and photographs in a jacket pocket. Some show a woman with an unbuttoned blouse with captions including \"come back soon\", \"I\u0027m pining for you\". It appears to be the woman who hugged him at the beginning of the film.On his walk, Marc comes across a ramshackle barn. As he gets closer, he can hear voices. He then sees a group of men who are encouraging a younger man to have sex with a pig. Unseen by the men, Marc watches for a while before heading away.Returning to the inn, Bartel is on the telephone and in conversation with the mechanic\u0027s wife. There will be a further delay in getting a replacement battery for the van. Marc heads outside to investigate for himself, but Bartel persuades him not to try the van.Bartel cooks a meal and as Marc eats, talks about his wife (\"Gloria\") who left him and how he is unable to tell jokes like he used to. He tells one, but it lacks enthusiasm. He then asks Marc to sing. Marc says he is tired and sings half a song half-heartedly. Bartel insists he finish. Marc completes the song with more gusto. He asks for a wake-up call the next morning and Bartel thanks him for the song.Marc wakes the next morning and it\u0027s already light. Bartel is nowhere to be found. Boris appears and is no wiser about where Bartel is. Marc checks the van and discovers that the battery has been removed. He goes back inside to make a telephone call but discovers that the line is dead. In fact, it\u0027s not even wired up!Something attracts he attention to the building across the courtyard. He enters the shabby room and looks around, finding his phone and the photos of the woman on a table. Bartel enters, somewhat annoyed. He says he\u0027d found the phone on the dinner table last night and was going to return it (this does not explain the photos, of course).Marc goes up to his room and finds it immaculate, but there are a woman\u0027s frocks in the wardrobe. He is distracted by smashing noises from outside. Bartel is taking a sledgehammer to his van. Marc goes back outside to find Bartel splashing petrol on the van. Bartel drops his matches, but as Marc remonstrates with him, Bartel asks why she came back, as if speaking to his wife and picks up the battery and slugs Marc with it. He then torches the van. Bartel drags Marc\u0027s unconscious body upstairs and dresses him in his wife\u0027s clothes. Next, Marc is struggling, tied to a chair and Bartel is using hand clippers to remove Marc\u0027s hair. He succeeds in cropping most of one side. That night, Marc is tied to the bed whilst Bartel prepares for bed. In underpants and a grubby vest, Bartel curls up next to Marc.The next morning, Marc is sat on the back of the tractor hitch wearing a dress and a windcheater jacket. Bartel is searching for an axe and talking about what a great Christmas they are going to have. In the forest, Bartel chops down a tree. Marc decides to make a run for it. When Bartel looks around again, Marc is gone. Curses!Marc runs some distance but gets caught in a snare. He falls on his face. With hands tied, he\u0027s stuck. At night, Bartel drives through the forest, calling out his wife\u0027s name. In the dark, torchlight finds Marc. It\u0027s Boris.

He shouts that he knows what \u0027Gloria\u0027 has been up to.Bartel passes some children (Borhan Du Welz, Maxime Dewitte, Alexis Dewitte, Liam Gilson, Raphaël Schmidt, Eliot Cahay and Farkhad Alekperov) in red hooded coats in the woods(!?!)Bartel goes to the village pub, and warns them to stay away from his place. It seems everyone knows what he is up to. He confronts the villager Robert and leaves saying, \"it\u0027s my wife\". One of the villagers (Vincent Cahay) takes to the piano, playing a dischordant dirge which turns into a frenzied beat. The villagers (Romain Protat, Damien Waselle, Viktor Mikol, Nedzad Kurtagic and Yves Vaucher) in the pub begin to dance a strange swaying dance to the music.Back at the inn, Bartel explains how he and \u0027Gloria\u0027 are going to reopen the inn with cabaret. There is a knock at the door. Boris has found his dog. The dog turns out to be a calf. Marc begins to wail. The room spins, picking out the faces of Bartel, Boris and Marc. Marc is going mad.A shot rings out and Boris spits blood, falling to the floor. Bartel picks out his rifle and smashes the lights out. Marc calls for help so Bartel clouts him with the butt of the gun. Shots ring out and in a dazed state, we see some of the villagers break in. Marc picks up an ornament to knock out Bartel, but Bartel is shot. The door is kicked through and a squealing pig is followed by Robert, Tomas and other villagers. Tomas picks up the calf and asks to leave, but Robert demands a song from Marc. The villagers join in the demand. Robert speaks to Marc as if he is Gloria, asking why she came back. One villager tries to rape Marc. In the mayhem that ensues, more shots ring out. Bartel and Boris are killed. Marc sneaks out. The villagers regroup outside the inn and use the pig as a bloodhound to track Marc\u0027s escape.The group persues Marc through rivers and woods. In the misty marsh, the pig and villagers give up, but Robert continues alone. Marc comes across a statue of Christ on the cross. Robert eventually catches sight of Marc in the boggy marshland. The chase continues at a snail\u0027s pace. Robert falls into soft peat and begins to sink in the bog.He calls out to Marc, who turns back. \"Why did you come back Gloria? You love me, don\u0027t you? Say it\". Kneeling by the hole, Marc replies \"I loved you\".We watch the frozen Belgian countryside shrouded in mist pass by.

The older nun goes through the door to find some kind of artifact, while the younger nun, Sister Victoria (Charlotte Hope) starts to pray. The older nun emerges attacked and bloodied, telling Victoria to run before she is pulled back into the darkness. Victoria runs toward a window as the attacker while clutching a key, the demon nun Valak (Bonnie Aarons), moves slowly but closer toward her. Victoria asks God for forgiveness before she jumps and hangs herself. Sometime later, her decaying body is discovered by a man simply known as Frenchie (Jonas Bloquet).The officials at the Vatican learn of Victoria\u0027s suicide, which is considered the ultimate sin. They enlist Father Anthony Burke (Demian Bichir) to investigate. He seeks out a young novitiate named Sister Irene (Taissa Farmiga), who currently acts as a teacher to young girls. The two get together and go to find Frenchie so he can take them to where he found Victoria\u0027s body.The three go to the abbey where Frenchie leads Burke and Irene to the ice box where he left Victoria\u0027s body. Frenchie points out that Victoria is sitting up when he left her body lying down. Burke pries Victoria\u0027s fingers open and finds the key in her hand. They then take her body to give her a proper burial. While walking back toward the abbey, Burke notices fresh blood on the steps where Frenchie found Victoria\u0027s body. They then go into the chapel but cannot enter the abbey yet. They meet the Abbess (Gabrielle Downey), who informs them that are engaging in a vow of silence for Victoria, and that they may enter the next day.Burke and Irene go to their rooms while Frenchie leaves. He walks past the dark woods and sees what looks like Victoria walking through the woods. He follows her and ends up attacked by a demon nun. Frenchie picks up a cross from the ground and walks away with it.Irene tells Burke about a series of visions she experienced as a child, all of which ended with her hearing the phrase \"Mary points the way\". Burke then recalls an incident in France in which he was summoned to exorcise a young boy named Daniel (August Maturo) that had been possessed. Despite Burke\u0027s efforts, the boy sustained fatal injuries from the exorcism, and Burke has been wracked with guilt ever since.Later that night, Burke is awoken by the sound of music. He goes out into the woods and sees what looks like a demonic version of Daniel. The vision comes to life and pushes Burke into a coffin before an unholy force buries him alive, leaving him with a bell to ring. Irene also wakes up and wanders the chapel before she sees Valak in the mirror trying to attack her. She runs outside and hears Burke ringing the bell. Soon, multiple bells around graves start to ring, but Irene manages to find Burke\u0027s coffin and she starts to dig him up. Before she can reach him, demon hands start to pull at him, but Irene manages to free him. Inside the coffin, Burke then finds a bunch of books on the occult.The next day, Burke and Irene go to the abbey, but only Irene is allowed to enter. She meets Sister Oana (Ingrid Bisu), who tells her that the nuns change shifts to pray to keep evil at bay. Oana hears about Irene seeing Valak, and Oana explains the demon\u0027s origin. When the abbey was built during the Dark Ages, a duke obsessed with the powers of Hell tried to open a rift to summon Valak, but several men found and killed the duke before Valak could fully emerge, keeping him trapped using an artifact (the same one the nuns from before were looking for) containing the blood of Christ. He remained sealed in Hell until bombs from World War II dropped around the abbey and broke the rift open, setting the demon loose. Oana explains that Valak takes the form of a nun to look like the rest of them and prey on their weaknesses. Meanwhile, Burke reads about Valak and learns his name.Frenchie is in a tavern where he hears that one of the patrons had a 12-year-old daughter that committed suicide by hanging after allegedly seeing something horrible. After Frenchie tells the bartender that he went up with Burke and Irene to the abbey, the bartender warns Frenchie that the two of them may be the next victims.Burke once again attempts to enter the abbey, only to encounter the Abbess again to tell him he won\u0027t find another way in. He tries to ask the Abbess about the key that he found with Victoria, but she tells Burke it\u0027s too late and that Irene is lost. Her body then appears to go limp. Burke tries to lift her veil to see her, but her demonic body grabs at him until he rips her hand off of him.Irene awakens after seeing another frightening vision of Valak. She wanders outside her room and is once again attacked by the demon nun. Burke hears the noise and tries to save her but he is also attacked until Frenchie shows up with a shotgun. Irene finds the other nuns and starts to pray alongside them as an evil force carves a pentagram into her back. Irene then sees what looks like Oana\u0027s dead body, but she quickly realizes that Oana and the other nuns were not real, but visions.The three reunite as they realize that Victoria was not trying to commit suicide, but rather sacrifice herself so that Valak could not possess her body and spread terror. They head into the catacombs to find the artifact with Christ\u0027s blood. Irene realizes that \"Mary points the way\" is in reference to the statue of Mary that literally points the way to where they may find the artifact. Sure enough, they come across the vial containing the blood after opening its chamber using Victoria\u0027s key. Soon, Valak reemerges and attacks the trio. He starts to try and possess Irene while Burke is attacked by the demonic Daniel. Irene is briefly possessed, but Frenchie manages to throw some blood on her to free her. Valak unleashes a dark force upon Frenchie, and then tries to drown Irene. He pulls her up and sees that the vial is broken. She spits the blood in Valak\u0027s face, sending the demon back to Hell and sealing the rift.As the trio leave the abbey, Irene asks Frenchie his real name, and he says it\u0027s Maurice. We then see an upside down cross burned into the back of Maurice\u0027s neck.The film concludes with a clip from the first \"Conjuring\" movie in the present day where Carolyn Perron (Lili Taylor) is watching Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) give a seminar on their encounter with the possessed Maurice, who later committed suicide. His contact with Lorraine caused her to see visions, and unfortunately for her, it would not be the last time that she encountered Valak.","numvotes":"135199","primarytitle":"The Nun"},"color":"rgb(65,97,106)","size":1.0},{"source":"object of desire","target":"tt13736064","id":"6565","attributes":{"productioncompany":"50 Cuts Associação Cinematográfica","countriesoforigin":"Portugal","averagerating":"6.8","titletype":"short","originaltitle":"Porque Odeias o Teu Irmão","storyline":"The misfortune of dementia locked Clara in the role of her mother\u0027s informal caregiver.

The ride then breaks down, and she sees what looks like the killer coming near her.

Suddenly a hand is seen at the door, trying to get in. Sensing danger, he quickly flees and goes down cobblestone streets and steps until he reaches a stable. Quickly he saddles a horse and secures the straps. He attempts to untie the rope, but suddenly the horse is startled and begins furiously bucking up and down, stomping him to death. Next we see a close-up of his face: half-mutilated with one eye hanging out. (Title shows.)Albert Kovac (Walter Brandi) is driving an open-air touring car down a country lane. He passes an old woman (in a deleted scene, he inquires of the woman where the castle is and she crosses herself). He turns into a drive leading up to a castle (Villa Hauff), parking in front. Removing his cap and putting it in the back seat, he retrieves his briefcase and goes to ring the bell at the front door.The bell will not ring, however. He knocks on the door and pushes it open. Entering, he calls out if anyone is home. He walks down the entrance hall, passing various statues and suits of armor. Hearing a noise behind him, he turns to see the maid, Louise (Tilde Till) who has come out from one of the rooms. He explains that no one answered when he came in. He asks her to introduce him and she opens a door and bids him enter. Inside, Corinne Hauff (Mirella Maravidi) is wiping off a standing suit of armor. He introduces himself and asks if she is the daughter of Dr. Jeronimus Hauff, which she confirms. She tells Louise to take the gentleman\u0027s coat. Louise is staring at Kovac as if she hasn\u0027t seen a man in years. Finally her attention is gained by Corinne and the coat is taken.He explains that he is an attorney who received a letter requesting he come and take care of Dr. Hauffs will. She leads him down a hall toward another room. On the way he notices a display case containing six mummified hands. He follows her into a bedroom where he is asked to show the letter. Giving it to Corinne, she hands it to Cleo Hauff (Barbara Steele) who is seated with cold cream on her face. Immediately she begins wiping her face and looks at the letter. Minutes later she emerges with her face clean and ready to talk.She asks if he is the attorney addressed on the envelope, Joseph Morgan (Riccardo Garrone). He explains that Morgan was absent when the letter arrived so he came at once since it seemed urgent. (In a deleted scene at the beginning of the film Morgan is seen leaving and Kovac reads the mail, finding the letter.) She reads from the letter and remarks how it looks like his writing and seal. He asks if her husband had told her about the letter. She responds that her husband has been dead for a year. Meanwhile there is a flash of lightning and the front door is blown open. Louise closes and bolts the door.Invited to stay the night, they are next seen at dinner, discussing the letter. Cleo speculates that it must be a fraud while Corinne insists that it is her fathers handwriting and seal. Cleo tells Kovac that the seal was buried with her husband and that she is his second wife. Kovac asks to smoke and is told of course . Louise enters and asks if she should serve the coffee. After this is done, she asks if she may be excused for the evening. Cleo excuses her and she politely curtsies to each of the ladies and leaves. Cleo remarks how not even a storm can keep Louise in the castle.Kovac tells them that the police will have to be informed of the death. Cleo tells him that it was Dr. Hauffs wish to be interred in the ground for one year before being laid to final rest. She says the villagers want nothing to do with this place, citing superstitions. Corinne corrects her, telling Kovac that her father was a spiritualist who tried to contact supernatural forces. She points to a bust of a woman which has three scratches on the cheek. He notes that they are real. Corinne says she believes it was done by something supernatural. Cleo tells her not to speak anymore of this. Cleo suggests that Kovac might want to telephone his office. Looking at his pocket watch, he remarks that Morgan is usually in his office at this time.Kovac picks up the phone, giving the operator Morgans number. All at once there is lightning and thunder and strange noises on the line. Outside we see part of the telephone line fall beside the grave of Jeronimus Hauff. Kovac asks the operator what is wrong with the line but she replies there is nothing wrong with it. At this point a strange man enters, carrying a candelabra. It is Kurt, the servant (Luciano Pigozzi) who stares at Kovac. We hear Kovac talking to himself, wondering about the strange man and how much he knows. Kurt closes the shutters and leaves the room just as Corinne enters. She tells Kovac that it is Kurt the gardener and that he has never left since the death of Dr. Hauff. Looking at a painting of the castle and surrounding area, she tells Kovac that hundreds of men died here, since it was once used as a hospital. As for the severed arms, Corinne tells him they are the mummified remains of those who spread the Black Plague. He makes a joke and she tells him not to, saying her father discovered many things about the house. She shows him to her fathers room, telling him to stay there for the night.Inside, he lights a cigarette, thinking of how strange the whole situation is. He finds another adjoining room and takes a candelabra in to see it. It is Dr. Hauffs office, where he finds an old Edison recording cylinder. Cranking it, he turns the needle to play the recording. It is the voice of Hauff, who talks about several people who were spreading the plague. When caught, their hands were severed before they were hanged. The remains were buried on the property. As he describes the sound of the wagon carrying corpses to a mass grave, the sounds of creaking wheels are heard outside. We see covered graves and wagon wheel tracks in the dirt.Corinne begins to undress in her room, when suddenly she turns to look and screams, covering herself. Kovac, hearing the scream, starts to her room. She comes out, claiming that she saw her father in her room. Cleo suggests that Corinne is too tired and on edge and has imagined it all. Entering her room, she reacts to the sight of a bronze bust of her father. Cleo tells her that it is only a statue. As they leave, Cleo tells Kovac that Corinne learned all of these things from her father. She says she will show Kovac where he died. They come to a long stairway going down below. She tells him that Dr. Hauff fell there and died. At the bottom of the stairs we see the face of Kurt, who looks up at them. Meanwhile, the recorded voice of Hauff, playing the last groove of the recording over and over, intones: I summoned them from their graves, and now I am among them.Outside, Kovac finds that an owl has gotten into his engine and caused damage (in a deleted scene we see the owl when Louise is admiring the car). When he asks Kurt how to get into town, he gets no reply. At this point Dr. Nemek (Alfredo Rizzo) walks up, telling Kovac that he will get nothing from Kurt. When Kovac shows the engine to Nemek, he says no one knows how to work on engines. Nemek explains that he is the new doctor for the area. Kovac asks for a ride into town and Nemek agrees. As they walk by the castle, he asks about what he sees. Nemek tells him that these are the unconsecrated graves of the plague spreaders from the fifteenth century. As they walk toward the horse and buggy, Corinne approaches and asks for a ride into town. They all get in and start out.Meanwhile, Cleo in their absence goes through the briefcase, removing documents to read. She asks the operator if the phone line to town has been repaired and is told it has. Then she hangs up.They arrive at a building where Nemek tells them he has to stop for a few minutes. He suggests they take a walk down by the lake. They do.Corinne talks about her father being misunderstood by everyone and that he had supernatural powers. She apologizes about her outburst last night, saying that he was in the room. They walk along the shoreline, past a number of small boats. She tells Kovac that her father used to bring her there often. She points out two sticks in the ground, a large one and a smaller one. Explaining that this is a sundial her father devised, she tells him that when the shadow of one touches the other, the time is right for fishing in the reeds. Turning back the other way, she suddenly screams my father! and runs into the reeds, falling down. Kovac chases her and she tells him that she saw her father in a boat in the reeds. We see it with an oar attached. She claims that the water dripping from the oar means it was just used. He tells her there is no one there. Frightened, she seeks comfort in his arms. Just then Nemek calls them to go back.They are seen in the home of Oskar Stinner (Ennio Balbo), a paralytic in a wheelchair. Corinne is seen dressing behind a sheet in silhouette. Her clothes which were hung by the fire are now dry and handed to her by Dr. Nemek. Kovac smokes and Corinne is shown getting dressed (shown behind the sheet). Nemek tells Kovac that Stinner has a fine wine for them. He gets the bottle and some glasses, explaining that he can smell a good wine for miles. Stinner refuses to drink, but wine is offered to Corinne and Kovac, who suggests they talk about the letter. He shows it to Nemek, who remarks how it looks authentic. Stinner asks to see it, telling them he has an old letter to compare it to. Pulling one out of his desk, he looks at both seals, saying they are the same. Kovac says the police must be informed. Stinner tells Corinne to get out of town before its too late. Nemek says they should get back home and tells Stinner not to worry and that he will come see him tomorrow. Kovac thanks Stinner and exits. Corinne hesitates by the door, telling Stinner she will see him again soon. As they leave, Stinner says to himself I will never see her again. I just know it. The day of revenge is at hand.Arriving at the local apothecary, Nemek tells them he knows the pharmacist who also serves as the mayor. Inside, he calls the mans name but gets no answer. They look around and Nemek continues to call out. As he looks behind the counter, he is horrified to see the man dead, with a bottle of acid dripping on his horribly disfigured face. They immediately get Corinne into the carriage to leave, telling her they will join her later. She drives off to return home.Inside the hall of records, Nemek fills out a death certificate and signs it, stating that cause of death was heart failure. Kovac asks whether the police should be involved but is told that a heart attack is not a violent death. Nemek asks the clerk for two forms, which he brings immediately. Looking at the forms, he asks the clerk why they are already filled out. He is told that the corpse collectors came by the village last night and that everyone knows when that happens that someone will die. Kovac says how could you know it would be the mayor? The clerk tells him it was one of the five men present at the death of Hauff and that they all are doomed to die.Cleo is seen in a bubble bath. Corinne enters and is asked to scrub Cleos back. Taking Corinnes hand, Cleo remarks how she is trembling. Corinne replies that she saw the mayors body, horribly eaten away by acid in the pharmacy. Cleo seems shocked and steps out of the bath. When asked if the mayor was her friend, Cleo says no, but he was one of the men who would come around to see Jeronimus. She states that all his friends were low-class individuals, not like what she was accustomed to. Corinne implies that her step-mother had been a performer. Cleo answers that she had to give up her career to marry Dr. Hauff, who became a crazy country doctor. She tells Corinne that it was not what she expected. Her friends formerly envied her. Rising to leave, Corinne tells her flat out that she is the same lousy actress she always was.Back at the hall of records, the clerk looks up and begins to read the death notice of Dr. Hauff, which was signed by the five men present at the time. He notes that three of them are dead and the remaining two have not long to live. Kovac takes the page with their names to study it. As Kovac calls out each of the three names, the clerk reads the fate of each one from the record. Asking who the fourth man is, the clerk is told Oskar Stinner. It is said that the name of the fifth man is unknown because the handwriting is illegible. Kovac expresses doubt that the friends of Hauff would want to kill him, but the clerk suggests they hated him because he dabbled in the occult.Back in his room, Kovac wonders about the fifth man. He plays the recording, hearing a girls voice singing remember pure water, pure water will save you. Looking out the window, he sees a young girl sitting at the fountain below. He goes down to the fountain but finds only the flowers the girl was holding, now discarded in the water.Stinner is seated at his desk when he hears the sounds of the corpse collectors wagon outside and declares that the end has come. After a torturous moment of worry, he rolls his wheelchair to the wall and removes a sword, which he places point-out from a chest of drawers. Backing up, he rushes upon the sword and kills himself. At this point the window opens from outside and we see Stinner dead from behind. One of the mummified hands is seen upon his shoulder, implying that it had come to kill him but was too late. The hand pulls Stinners wheelchair back off of the sword, which drips. We see from a front angle that Stinners intestines are hanging out. (In a deleted scene there is an alternative death scene where he dies by hanging himself instead of by sword.)Next day a policeman is shown investigating at Stinners place. Nemek tells him he will come by the station later to file a report. He tells the men to take the body away. Kovac asks Nemek if he still believes this is coincidence, to which Nemek replies he isn\u0027t sure anymore. When Kovac reminds him that they both heard the clerk predicting the death but they did nothing, Nemek replies that there is nothing they could have done to have prevented Stinner from taking his own life. Kovac suggests that maybe Hauff is still alive and that his body has not been seen, except by the witnesses. Finding a partially-burned note on the desk, Kovac shows in to Nemek, telling him that Stinner was writing it to warn the final victim, who was summoned. He tells him that tomorrow Hauffs body will be dug up to be re-interred. They are hoping to see the body at that time, which would prove whether Hauff is really dead.The next day at the cemetery a small gathering stands around the temporary grave. As the slab is removed from the grave, those present see that it is empty. Some gasping is heard from the ladies. Kovac thinks to himself so that means the fifth witness is in danger. He is directed to a phone to call his boss but is told he has left for the Villa Hauff. Explaining to Nemek, Kovac says the fifth witness is Morgan, since he was the one summoned by the original letter.Morgan enters the castle and looks around, seeing no one. He goes into another room and hears Dr. Hauff greeting him from a chair across the room (his face is not visible, but as Morgan nervously approaches, he notices a ring on Hauffs hand with a large jeweled J).Kovac and Nemek arrive and begin to search for Morgan. His hat is seen on a hallway table. Morgan comes out from the front room in a state of shock. The men sit him down. He tells them that he saw Jeronimus. When Kovac goes to search the room, he finds only a cat in the chair. He is given a sedative by Dr. Nemek. Kovac demands to know why he has come. Nemek suggests that this discussion take place later. Kovac leaves with an apology, giving Morgan the letter.Next we see Louise preparing to leave, questioned by Corinne about what she saw. She says she saw nothing, only feeling more coldness in the house than during a normal winter. Locking herself in the kitchen in fear, she tells Corinne she heard the voice of Jeronimus speaking. Asking what he said, she says to ask Kurt. At this point she leaves, saying that she can no longer remain in this house.Corinne apologizes to Kovac, telling him it is her fault for asking him to remain. She confesses her need for him and they kiss. At this point they are interrupted by Nemek, who asks for cognac. She goes to fetch it while the men sit down. Kovac tells Nemek that Morgan is highly believable, because he doesn\u0027t believe in ghosts. They both agree that Kurt needs to be found so that what he knows can be determined. Corinne enters with a tray and two glasses, carrying some kind of dispenser which she sets on the table. Nemek seems pleased and Corinne adjusts something on the dispenser.Louise is seen walking through the woods. Bird sounds are heard, which gradually give way to the sound of the corpse collectors cart. Louise looks around but sees nothing. She hurries away.Morgan is awakened by the door opening. Cleo comes in and he stands to greet her. From their conversation we learn that they had agreed to separate for one year after the death of Jeronimus, but Cleo tells him they cant just resume their affair now. Confessing his love, Morgan begins kissing her shoulder. Next they are seen in bed, kissing.Meanwhile Corinne goes to the attic with Kovac to look around. They find a doll, which she explains was hers. It contains a music box which plays. Kovac remarks that he knows that tune. Corinne tells him it is an old song which she then sings. He remembers it from the recording he heard before and wonders what is the meaning of pure water will save you?Cleo listens as Morgan reads the letter sent to his office, which was signed by Jeronimus. She asks if he believes Hauff wrote it. He tells her he knows who is behind all this. Checking his gun, he informs her that there was one more witness there that night: Kurt.Corinne and Kovac go down below into a crypt-like room where she calls out for Kurt. Hearing no answer, they leave. One wall opens and Kurt enters, carrying the body of Hauff, which he lays on the slab. He says to the corpse that the night of revenge has begun. He removes the ring (which contains the J used to make the seal) from Hauffs finger and places it in a torch, which causes it to flare up. Soon the hour of death will come, he says, which will free the spirits of the plague spreaders, who will begin killing the innocent and guilty alike. He confesses his loyalty to Hauff but asks forgiveness for having to break his vow of silence, since Corinne will have to be warned.Nemek asks whether they found Kurt, to which Kovac says no, telling him that they searched the entire house. At this moment Corinne screams as she sees Kurt coming in, his face all covered with oozing sores, signs of the plague. Nemek tells them not to touch him. Kurt says the night of his revenge has begun, and they are here. Pointing to a full-length mirror, he says that one year ago he saw it all happen here. In a flash-back sequence, we see the five men (not including Kurt) and Cleo all facing Jeronimus, who reveals that they had all signed a petition to run him out of town. He refuses to leave, telling them he knows too much about their sins and will alert the public. He addresses each one, telling what he knows. Finally he faces Cleo and Morgan, telling them he had known about their clandestine affair for some time. Morgan approaches him with a candlestick to strike him from behind. Encouraged by each face, he hesitates until Cleo cries out kill him, Joseph! Hauff is struck from behind and falls, cursing them all and telling them that they wont escape his anger.Coming out of the flashback, Cleo tells him to go back to the dead and throws a candlestick at the mirror, breaking it. Hauffs voice is heard summoning the dead spirits of the plague spreaders to avenge him. The grave covers are slid over and we see at least one hand emerging. Cleo cries no and begins to run. She goes from door to door but cannot escape. She opens a double outer door and screams. As she turns back inside, we see her face with signs of the plague. She staggers around the room, getting a glimpse of her face reflected in the tray. Finally she falls upon the harp and breathes her last. Morgan shouts that he will not die. Pulling out his gun, he tells Hauff that he is not afraid but begins acting like he is being stalked. Firing several shots, he too receives signs of the plague and collapses. As Kovac looks at him, he notices on a grandfather clock the painting of the young girl at the fountain, again wondering about the pure water that will save them. (In a deleted scene Kovac is told about the painting of this legendary girl who would save the village with purified water.) Thunder and lightning are heard. All at once he announces that water is the answer. He tells Nemek to take Corinne outside. She protests that she wants to remain with Kovac.Opening up a door, Kovac sees Louise, now covered with the plague. She dies in his arms. He goes outside to join the others. The sounds of the corpse collectors cart are heard and the open graves are viewed. Kovac tells them that it is the water that has kept the spirits away, and now that all the water is drying up, they can only hope for rain. Nemek takes Corinne aside and a mummified hand is seen in the bushes. When we see Nemek again, he has the plague, telling her not to touch him. Kovac stumbles around, backing away from an unseen spirit. Only the shadow is visible approaching him. As he is backed into a corner and sinks down, suddenly the menacing sounds stop and raindrops appear. Corinne calls out that it is raining and the two of them embrace. Saved from the avengers, they are seen walking off together as the rain comes down.","numvotes":"1014","primarytitle":"Terror-Creatures from the Grave"},"color":"rgb(93,99,84)","size":1.0},{"source":"weapon","target":"tt0454082","id":"7089","attributes":{"notes":"Disability motif","runtimeminutes":"95","sex of killer":"male","synopsis":"On a snowy winter night on Christmas Eve, in the Alpha Kappa Gamma sorority house, Lauren (Yan-Kay Crystal Lowe) is getting changed into her pajamas. In the next room Clair Crosby (Leela Savasta) is writing a Christmas card to her half-sister, Leigh (Kristen Cloke). Suddenly she hears something from her closet. She goes over to the closet door and looks inside. Nothing but clothes. She goes back to her card and sees that her fountain pen is missing. Suddenly a figure wraps a bag around her head. In the struggle, the figure stabs the pen into her eye.At a mental institution not far away, Billy Lenz (Robert Mann) is being served his Christmas dinner. He is locked away, rocking back and fourth in his rocking chair, safely in his cell that is decorated with Christmas lights. The orderly serving the food gets a scare from a volunteer dressed as Santa who is looking for the children\u0027s ward. Security guard J. Bailey (Ron Selmour) makes jokes to the orderly about Billy trying to escape every year. The orderly and Santa walk away, leaving the security guard alone in the hall. Billy opens the small window on his cell and places a present wrapped in newspaper on the ledge for the security guard. The security guard opens it to find nothing that interesting, except on the newspaper is written \"I\u0027ll be home for Christmas.\" The security guard looks into the cell to find it empty and Billy\u0027s chair rocking back and fourth. He quickly opens the cell and goes inside, to find a hole in the wall. He takes his flashlight and looks into the hole, as Billy comes from under the bed and stabs him in the neck with a candy cane. Billy leaves the cell and kills the man dressed as Santa. He steals his outfit, stuffs his body in a bag, and leaves the institution, dumping the bag in the dumpster with the man\u0027s hand sticking out from the bag.Outside of the sorority house, Kelli Presley (Katie Cassidy) and her boyfriend Kyle Autry (Oliver Hudson) are talking in his car. She tells him that she is going to spend Christmas with her roommates but that she will make it up to him. He is disappointed because this is their first Christmas together. She kisses him goodbye and goes inside the house. As she does her fellow sorority sister Megan Helms (Jessica Harmon) calls Kyle on his cell phone. Meanwhile, Megan is in her room, watching an old home made porn movie that features her and Kyle. Kyle hangs up the phone. Kelli goes inside and greets everyone, including Melissa Kitt (Michelle Trachtenberg), her best friend. Heather Fitzgerald (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), Dana Mathis (Lacey Chabert), Lauren Hannon and Ms. MacHenry (Andrea Martin), the house mother who loves all of the girls and accepts their flaws.They have a \"secret Santa\" gift giving thing going and Ms. Mac wants to know who got Billy. According to her, Billy (Cainan Wiebe) killed his family here. When Billy was born, he has a liver disorder that makes his skin yellow. His father loves him regardless but his mother is disappointed and wants nothing to do with him. They live in the house that is now the sorority house. As Billy gets a bit older he is treated even worse by his mother, who has become an alcoholic. On Christmas, when he is five, his mother tells him Santa was shot down by the Russians. His father, however, tells him he has a present for him hidden in a stow-away space in Billy\u0027s closet. Billy goes into his room, which will become Eve\u0027s in the present day, and finds a telescope, making him briefly very happy. However his mother and father are not getting along very well, and his mom is having an affair. Moments after finding the telescope, Billy hears arguing and looks under the door to witness his father with a bag over his head and his head being bashed in with a hammer. Billy runs back to his room as his mother and her lover take the body outside and begin to bury it in the crawl space under the house. Billy is watching this and is discovered. His mother chases him into the attic and locks him in there.All of the girls are horrified by this story but Ms. Mac assures them it is all true. Heather says she was the one who drew Billy\u0027s name for secret Santa but she thought it was wrong to buy him a gift because he was a murderer and it was offensive to the birth of Jesus to make a mockery of gift giving. Heather starts to go upstairs to her room but runs into Eve Agnew (Kathleen Kole). Eve has been upstairs the whole time and is leaving to go visit her family. She gives Heather her secret Santa gift, a crystal statue of a unicorn. Heather is less than impressed and bids Eve farewell. Eve goes towards the door but Ms. Mac tells her she has a present for her. Before she can find it, Eve leaves, obviously disappointed by Heather\u0027s reaction.Kelli and Lauren go upstairs to tell Clair and Megan they are going to open the presents. Clair obviously doesn\u0027t answer. Lauren pounds on the door and says she is going to steal her presents if she doesn\u0027t get down here. Laughing, Kelli does this on Megan\u0027s door. Megan tells them to go away and she doesn\u0027t want to open presents. They leave and Megan hears a snow globe tune playing in the attic. She goes into the attic and asks if someone is playing a joke. She gets more then she bargained for when she finds Clair\u0027s body by the window in a rocking chair. Someone comes from behind and smashes the snow globe into her head. She falls onto the ground as a bag is put over her head. She fights back, but the figure rips out one of her eyes with their bare hand!The home phone rings, Melissa answers it and puts it on loud-speaker. The caller is making all sorts of weird noises. Lauren teases him, and the caller threatens to kill Lauren before hanging up. Heather says someone is obviously sick in the head and doesn\u0027t need to be provoked by Lauren. Melissa checks the caller ID and is surprised to see it\u0027s coming from Megan\u0027s cell. They assure themselves it\u0027s just a joke.They open their presents, with Ms. Mac getting some lingerie as a gag gift. Everyone laughs and Kelli goes back upstairs to check on the girls. Kyle suddenly pops out of Megan\u0027s room. Kelli screams and the other girls rush upstairs. Kyle apologizes and says he wanted to surprise her. Ms. Mac asks if Megan is in her room and Kyle says he doesn\u0027t know. Lauren asks him how he could have just been in her room and not know if she is in there. He explains that it\u0027s really dark in there. He makes a joke about Billy getting her. He then tells everyone another story about Billy\u0027s past.Billy was kept in the attic for many years. His mother and stepfather lived happily without him. Everything was wonderful except his mom couldn\u0027t get pregnant by his step-father, and was sexually frustrated by his inability to maintain an erection. On Christmas, when Billy was twelve, she crept into the attic and had sex with him, her own son! Nine months later she gave birth to a baby girl named Agnes (Dean Friss). She loves Agnes, and uses the occasion to further reject Billy, looking up to the attic where Billy is kept, and saying in reference to Agnes, \"She\u0027s my family now.\" Variants of this line are used repeatedly in the rest of the movie. As Agnes grew older, Billy became jealous. One Christmas, Agnes got a doll for a present. A jealous Billy releases a tantrum and breaks the attic door open and rushes to the living room, attacking Agnes and pulling out one of her eyes, stabbing his stepfather in the face and beating his mom to death with a dough roller. When the police arrive on the scene, they find him eating a cookie made from his mother\u0027s flesh. Agnes was put into an orphanage and no one knows where she is today.The girls are freaked out by the story. Kelli goes inside Megan\u0027s room and finds the porn video on the computer. She breaks down and Kyle tells her it was from a long time ago. Kelli screams for him to leave the house and he becomes enraged, calling the women \"spoilt bitches.\" Ms. Mac goes off on him about treating Kelli like that, pushing him towards the stairs. As Kyle leaves, a figure is standing by the tree looking at the presents. Ms. Mac asks who the person is. Clair\u0027s half-sister, Leigh tells the girls that Claire never called her, telling her she was ready to be picked up and she is worried. Dana says she even had no idea Clair had a sister. Leigh explains they are only half-sisters and are trying to get to know each other.Suddenly the power goes out in the house. Dana says the circuit breaker is under the house and she will go turn it on. She goes outside and smokes, dropping her cigarette into a hole on the porch. She hears someone underneath it. Taking her flashlight she opens the door to the crawl space and looks inside. Suddenly someone grabs her, pulling her in. The two struggle as the figure grabs a gardening tool and stabs Dana in the head. Lauren is beyond drunk now, having been drinking booze the whole night. Melissa tells her she smells and needs to shower. As she showers, someone watches from a broken tile in the floor. After the shower, Lauren goes to bed.Everyone starts asking where the other girls are, since Clair, Megan and Dana have disappeared. Kelli questions what is taking Dana so long, and is even more startled when someone calls from Dana\u0027s cell number and hangs up. The rest of the girls go outside to look for Dana. Heather and Leigh find Eve\u0027s car still parked outside. They open the car door and scream as Eve\u0027s severed head rolls out. The girls scream and run back into the house, locking the door behind them. Kelli calls the police but because of the snow it may take over two hours for them to arrive. Ms. Mac tells everyone that they can pile into her car and try to find help. Kelli says that they won\u0027t get far and that they need to stick together. Heather says she wants to leave, and Ms. Mac tells the girls that they can stay and she will go with Heather to find help. The two go outside and get in the car. Ms. Mac gets out of the car to scrape the ice off of the windshield. As she begins to scrape Billy\u0027s yellow eye comes into view inside the car. Ms. Mac gasps as he kills Heather, her blood spraying all over the windshield. Ms. Mac falls against the garage door, causing an icicle to fall from above which impales her head.Leigh notices that Ms. Mac hasn\u0027t left yet. She decides to go see what\u0027s going on. Kelli decides to go out with her, leaving Melissa and a sleeping Lauren behind. As they leave the house a figure grabs Heather\u0027s unicorn statue and walks down the hall. In the garage, Leigh slips on Ms. Mac\u0027s blood and screams. Upon hearing this Melissa rushes towards the stairs. A figure grabs wraps a bag over her head, slamming her into a wall. She rips the bag off and rushes through the house and into her room. She grabs a stick and hits the figure with it. Melissa opens a window and is going to climb out but the figure throws an ice-skate at her, cutting off the back of her head.Kelli and Leigh rush inside and call for Melissa. There is no answer and they go to Lauren\u0027s room, closing the door behind them. But someone is on the other side of the door and kicks it open. It\u0027s Kyle. Leigh attacks him and he throws her against Lauren\u0027s bed, causing the covers fall off of Lauren, who is very much dead with her eyes gouged out! Everyone screams and Kyle insists he isn\u0027t the killer. Kelli calls Lauren\u0027s cell phone and hears it ringing in the attic. She explains that the killer might be in the attic with her phone. Kyle opens the attic door and is pulled inside. Kelli and Leigh try to get into the attic but the door is slams shut. Kyle fights back as a bag is put over his head. Kelli breaks the door open and witnesses Kyle being stabbed with the unicorn statue, then one of his eyes being ripped out and eaten! Leigh attacks the figure and is thrown across the attic, discovering her half-sisters body still in the rocking chair. The figure attacks Kelli and Leigh tries to help but is knocked into a hole in the floor. A bag is put over Kelli\u0027s head but she grabs a fork and stabs the figure in the eye. She gets up and sees the figure has a glass eye. It\u0027s Agnes. Kelli tells Agnes everything is okay and she doesn\u0027t have to do this. She tells him her brother isn\u0027t here, he is still locked away. Agnes tells her that she doesn\u0027t have a brother, only a father. Billy comes from behind and lights a candle.Agnes attacks Kelli but is knocked into another hole in the floor that pins her between the walls! Billy pushes Kelli into the same hole, accidentally knocking over the candle. Kelli has grabbed onto a string of Christmas light attached to a small tree, trying to keep from falling completely in. She screams for help as Agnes starts to crawl up the hole. Leigh comes to her rescue, smashing open the wall. Agnes grabs Leigh\u0027s head but she manages to fight her off. Leigh runs through the house and smashes out another wall, finally reaching the spot where Kelli is trapped. Billy is climbing into the hole and Agnes is crawling up it! Leigh grabs Kelli and pulls her to safety as the Christmas tree catches fire (along with the rest of the attic) and falls into the hole, burning Agnes and Billy. The two survivors rush outside.At the hospital Kelli is going to have some tests done to make sure she is okay. Leigh has a present in her hand from Clair. She tells Kelli she wants to open it now because she won\u0027t be able to open it in front of her family. She says that she is glad she got to know Clair before all of this happened. She opens the present and finds a watch engraved with \"Family Forever.\" She starts to cry as a nurse comes in and tells Kelli they need her for some x-rays.Some time later Leigh goes back to Kelli room to see if she is back from the x-rays. A body with blonde hair lays in the bed, but as she approaches the person turns over to reveal Agnes. Leigh screams as Agnes grabs her by the throat and snaps her neck.Kelli comes back into the room and feels something is wrong. She finds Leigh\u0027s new watch. She sees blood on the ceiling above her and starts to leave the room, but Agnes grabs her from behind the curtain and starts to strangle her. Kelli grabs a defibrillator paddle and shocks Agnes in the head with it, killing her. This is the ending for the UK version. The US version continues from here when Billy comes down from the ceiling, as Kelli rushes from the room. She grabs some crutches that are in the hall and starts to beat him with it. She turns to run, thinking he is unconscious but he grabs her foot, causing her to fall over a medical cart. Billy grabs a scalpel from the pile of medical supplies now on the floor and takes chase. Kelli rushes to the stairs as Billy comes from behind, slashing her with the scalpel. She grabs him and throws him over the stairway, causing him to fall on top of the Christmas tree below, impaling him. His intestines spew out, he is very much dead, and Kelli is left to look on in shock as the credits start...","numvotes":"27084","primarytitle":"Black Christmas","productioncompany":"Dimension Films","countriesoforigin":"Canada, United States","averagerating":"4.6","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"Black Christmas","storyline":"In the 70\u0027s, the boy Billy is born with yellow skin due to a liver disease and his dysfunctional mother rejects him.

With Death waiting around the corner, Wendy and Kevin Fischer must try and work out Death\u0027s plan, before they and the remaining survivors end up dead. —FilmFanUK","startyear":"2006","runtimeminutes":"93","synopsis":"The film begins with opening credits on Monday nightlife 21 March 2005 at 19:55 Vancouver Time, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada by Wendy Christensen (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), an obsessive-compulsive driven high school graduate from McKinley High, photographing her friends on a ride called the \"High Dive\". Shortly after she takes their picture, she notices the letter \"V\" missing out of the ride name, but thinks nothing of it. As the beginning of the movie progresses, we\u0027re introduced to several characters, including Wendy\u0027s boyfriend Jason Wise (Jesse Moss), her best friend Carrie Dreyer (Gina Holden), and her boyfriend Kevin Fischer (Ryan Merriman), as well as several other characters; the jock Lewis Romero (Texas Battle), the valley-girlesque Ashley Freund and Ashlyn Halperin (Chelan Simmons and Crystal Lowe), the social outcasts Ian McKinley and Erin Ulmer (Kris Lemche and Alexz Johnson), as well as Wendy\u0027s attitude-laden sister Julie (Amanda Crew) and the troublesome alumnus Frankie Cheeks (Sam Easton). Before the premonition, the hydraulic pump beneath Lewis Romero\u0027s seat begins to leak when a roller coaster attendant secures his seat restraint. The premonition begins when Wendy Christensen has sat herself toward the back of the roller coaster and pulls her digital camera out to snap a photo. The moment the camera takes the picture, a roller coaster attendant waves his hand in front of her, ruining the photo. He points to a sign explaining that no cameras or loose articles can remain on the ride. Kevin suggests that he put her camera in a pocket inside of his jacket. A few rows ahead, Frankie Cheeks overhears the attendant and conceals his video camera inside of his jacket. Kevin becomes excited for the ride until he withdraws his hand from the handlebar in front of him after getting his fingers stuck in sticky gum left by a previous passenger. The attendants give the OK to start the ride, and the roller coaster begins its ascension to the top of the initial drop. As the ride progresses, the leaking hydraulic line rattles and loosens. While going through a loop, Frankie yells at Ashley Freund and Ashlyn Halperin to flash him. Annoyed, Ashlyn slaps the camera out of Frankie\u0027s hand, which magically catches onto and wraps around the tracks at the bottom of the loop. The coaster runs over the camera, which loosens a wheel on the left side of the front cart, and severs the hydraulic line and unlocks all of the safety restraints, threatening the lives of all of the passengers. As the roller coaster continues along the tracks, the front left wheel pops off, showering sparks onto the passengers. As the passengers scream in terror, they attempt to remain in their seats while the coaster runs through corkscrews, hills, and sharp turns. More pieces from the coaster train break off. As the coaster hops over a hill and makes a sharp turn, the force causes carts one through three to separate from carts four through six. The front three carts fly off the tracks, killing Carrie Dreyer, Jason Wise, Ashley, Ashlyn, Frankie, and five others. Lewis is thrown out of his seat but manages to hang onto the coaster for dear life as it travels through more corkscrews. He loses his grip and is flung toward the back of the coaster where he is narrowly saved by Kevin Fischer. As Kevin catches Lewis, his seat restraint breaks away. Kevin manages to hang onto Lewis before a metal covering from the cart in which Lewis sat breaks away and smashes into him, sending him flying into a steel support beam, snapping his spine in half and causing a part of the support beam to jut out over a portion of the roller coaster tracks. The piece of metal that hit Lewis smashes onto another portion of the roller coaster tracks, causing the tracks to become uneven. The roller coaster continues to bunny hop toward another large loop, where, as it ascends toward the top of the loop, it begins to slow to a stop due to the train\u0027s missing wheel grinding against the tracks. The coaster becomes stuck upside down at the top of the loop. Erin Ulmer and Ian McKinley fall from their seats but are able to hang on to their restraints. Shortly after, they lose their grip, and Ian falls to his death, followed by Erin. Two unseen characters, later revealed to be Perry Malinowski and Julie Christensen, fall out of their seats to their deaths as well. Kevin and Wendy attempt to get the coaster out of the loop by rocking it backward. They succeed, but in the process, Kevin gets his coat stuck on a broken piece of his missing seat restraint as the coaster goes backward. The piece of support beam that juts out over the tracks from when Lewis was killed slices through Kevin\u0027s torso, cutting him in half. Wendy screams in horror and cries before the coaster hits the dislodged portion of the track. The train scorpion-tails backward as it is ripped off from the tracks and falls to the ground. Wendy is thrown out of her seat as the coaster falls, and she is killed when she lands on another portion of tracks below and it is then revealed that the derailment was a vision of Wendy\u0027s, and the roller coaster is still at its station. She panics and the roller coaster attendants release the seat restraints only in carts four through six, allowing several of the students off before a large fight ensues. Ashley and Ashlyn get off the ride, followed by Frankie who is videotaping them. Jason attempts to leave the coaster, but can\u0027t get the attention of the ride operator due to the fight. The remaining passengers begin to chant \"Hey! Ho! Let\u0027s go!\", prompting the ride operator to start the ride. As a security guard leads Wendy and the other students toward the exit of the ride, Wendy notices Jason and Carrie are still in the roller coaster. Panicked, she runs back to the ride platform and tells the attendants to stop the ride his screams \"Stop it! No! Stop it! Stop it! Please! Please, the tracks are broken. Stop! Stop! Please! Jason!\", but is forced outside of the ride exit. As Wendy and Kevin are escorted away on security guard word Voice tell \"Hey, just relax, OK Please Ease up, man. She\u0027s all right. OK Just let her settle down. She can settle down at home Now listen what is your home phone number OK, we\u0027re gonna call your mother. Everything will be taken care of......\" from the ride, the roller coaster crashes, killing Jason, Carrie and five others along with Wendy start cries word voice tell \"Jason!\".Several weeks later, Wendy is at the school and is confronted by Kevin, concerned about her and the loss of Jason and Carrie. Wendy insists to be left alone. Ashley and Ashlyn invite her to a tanning session, and she takes their phone number. As she makes her way to her car, Kevin explains that this has happened before, with flight 180 and the seven people who got off and mysteriously died. Wendy drives off as thunder booms overhead.Ashley and Ashlyn head over to their favorite tanning salon, hoping to bronze up for the graduation. They both have slurpees, and the owner insists they throw them away, as he heads off to complete a phone call. Ashley merely pretends to throw her drink away, and they both head to the tanning room, where they proceed to disrobe. Ashley sets her drink right above a cooling unit of the tanning beds. She also reaches for a CD, leaning on a shelf and slightly loosening it on the side. The owner heads out the door, with only a tube of lotion holding it open. However, the lotion squirts out, and the door closes shut and locks.Meanwhile, Wendy is looking over the photos she took the night of the accident, after promising Julie to borrow the camera to her. Julie lends her a bracelet left behind as a family heirloom. It\u0027s then she notices a photo of Jason with a foreshadowing of the coaster behind him as it is about to hit his head, and gets an eerie feeling as the light bulb dims in and out. She then looks at the picture of Ashley and Ashlyn, which appears to be over-saturated, reminiscent of flames. She finds Ashley\u0027s number and proceeds to dial.Back at the tanning salon, Ashley\u0027s slurpee has begun to leave a water residue, which leaks into the cooling unit and forces the temperature to rise slightly. As the girls seem to notice this, a cooling fan causes a coat rack to to fall over and knock over a plant, causing the plant to fall onto the shelf and collapse. The panel from the self slides right between the handles of both beds, locking Ashley and Ashlyn in as the temperature rapidly rises. Both girls wince and scream in agony as the bulbs begin overheating and eventually breaking, causing their skin to bubble, and soon a fire breaks out, setting both beds ablaze. The owner tries to get in, but the back door is locked, and he also locked the front. The girls are burned alive in the blazing tanning beds.The next scene is at Vancouer English Roman Catholic Cemetery funeral, where Ian begins questioning the preacher\u0027s comments about the equality of death and is led off by Lewis and Kevin. Afterward, Kevin finds Wendy kneeling at Jason\u0027s death grave (Age: 18, Born: Monday 23 February 1987, Died: Monday 30 May 2005, Status: Deceased), and she begins to show him pictures that depict what\u0027s going to happen beforehand, including a picture showing a plane\u0027s shadow about to crash into the World Trade Center in Manhattan, New York City. Suddenly, a strange wind blows over both of them, and Kevin tells Wendy he\u0027s going to get her some food.The two go to a local drive-thru restaurant, unaware that Frankie is ahead of them in his sports coupe. On the way, the two almost hit a truck in their vehicle, forcing the driver to jump aside. They get to the drive-thru of the restaurant, noticing a vehicle is pulling behind them and also to the side, blocking Wendy\u0027s exit. The sign also shows a the word \"control\" glitching out, and soon the radio kicks on, playing \"Turn Around, Look at Me\" by the Lettermen. Suddenly, Wendy and Kevin notice a driverless truck coming their way. They can\u0027t escape the vehicle, and they unknowingly honk at Frankie to move aside, only to have him flip them off. The couple behind them move their car, and they smash the windshield and jump out of the vehicle before the runaway truck hits it. The vehicles collide, forcing Kevin\u0027s car to eject its engine out of the front. It slides along the back of Frankie\u0027s car, and the fan cuts right into the back of his head, killing him. Wendy and Kevin go to check who the dead person was, and a \"jolt\" moment occurs when the fan spins one last time, splattering Frankie\u0027s brains all over the wall.After a talk with the coroner, Kevin and Wendy begin to calculate Death\u0027s design and who was sitting where on the roller coaster. They look over the photos and decide to pay Lewis a visit while he\u0027s in the middle of a workout. Lewis dismisses their claims and proceeds with his workout, even as Wendy points out to Kevin that his photo shows a Sultan caricature with swords, a weight dropping on his head, and a crying bear in the picture. (There\u0027s a tall bear statue and a sign with loose swords in the weight room). Lewis begins to work out with the other team members around him, causing the swords above his weight machine to rattle loose. Suddenly, one of Lewis\u0027 teammates accidentally jars a tooth out of the bear\u0027s mouth, forcing a weight lifter to drop his weights. Lewis stops for a moment, and the swords come down, missing him and instead cutting off a cable on the machine he\u0027s working on, unbeknownst to Wendy, Kevin and Lewis. Lewis takes this moment of apparent victory over Death and lifts the weights one more time, only to have the the two weights on top smash his head to bits.After a conversation about the bizarre occurrences, Wendy and Kevin make their way to a hardware store where Ian and Erin work. Ian is seen shooting at pigeons with a nail gun, then sets it down. He then makes light of the events that are occurring and makes fun with Wendy and Kevin. However, soon some accidents are set into motion and a forklift begins moving and knocking objects around, and it forces it to start lifting on a wall loaded with objects, including sharpened stakes and pieces of flat plywood. As Ian theorizes about Death\u0027s design, Wendy notices the stakes, and Kevin saves him as various items begin falling down. The plywood boards soon start stacking on top of each other, and a piece of wood flies off and penetrates a bag of sawdust, blinding Erin. She ends up falling backwards and lands with the back of her head against a nail gun, and nine rounds end up getting fired through her head and hand, killing her. Wendy, Kevin and Ian stare in horror.After a visit to the police station and the disbelief that follows, Wendy and Kevin split up, with Ian unnoticeably looking at Wendy from his truck. Wendy ends up falling asleep at her house, and Julie comes along to take the lucky bracelet back, for good luck. Upon leaving, Wendy wakes up and realizes that Julie and her friend Perry sneaked into the ride as well, upon identifying the bracelet in a photograph. She calls Kevin and informs him that his photo looks like something glaring, with bright lights. It\u0027s then that Kevin informs her that he\u0027s overlooking security at a colonial fair, complete with fireworks, and Wendy starts heading out the door to the fair. Soon, the song she heard at the drive-thru begins playing again, and she notices a vehicle following her. She almost hits a wolf in the middle of the road but continues to the fair.Kevin notices Julie and her friends Perry (Maggie Ma) and Amber (Ecstasia Sanders) at the fair and tries to talk to her, but she runs off after being annoyed by him. Meanwhile, an actor at the fair leaves his lighting stick in front of a cannon, knocking it sideways and forcing a cannonball to run along and knock one of the firework trailer cars off balance. Wendy shows up, suspecting Kevin might be struck by fireworks. As the show at the fair starts, and fireworks begin to go off, a couple of teenagers set off some firecrackers, startling a nearby horse. The horse begins running through the crowd, dragging a wooden stake behind him. Julie ends up getting the rope tied around her neck, and almost gets impaled on a rake that the horse jumps over. Kevin, however, manages to cut her loose. It\u0027s then that Wendy asks the frantic Julie who was sitting next to her on the roller coaster, and she glances at Perry. As Perry realizes this and begins standing up, the horse, still startled, pulls a flagpole off a trailer, which launches itself into Perry\u0027s back, killing her.After a close call with Kevin where he is nearly killed by a blazing gas leak, Julie and Wendy begin to drag him off, only to run into Ian, who thinks that he is the cause of Wendy\u0027s death (indicated by a shirt she was wearing, bearing his last name, which is also the name of their school). He confronts them as a firework cart begins wobbling and aims the fireworks right at them. The three duck as the fireworks go off, which entirely avoid Ian. Thinking he\u0027s safe and that Wendy is next, a loosened crane of a cherry picker that was struck by fireworks launches the McKinley sign downwards which cuts Ian in half. His corpse appears to be flipping off the three, and the screen fades to white.Five months later, on Monday 21 November 2005 as \"FIVE MONTHS LATER\", Wendy is shown to be in another town, starting a new life with her friends. She is on board of a subway train along with them, and starts to notice advertisements of the locations the previous deaths occurred at, as well as the \"Turn Around, Look at Me\" song being sung by a patron. She then gets uncomfortable and tries to exit the train, but is stopped by Julie, who also boards the train. As she does, a group of football fans drop an unfinished candy bar, which misses a trash can and falls onto the tracks, where a rat begins eating it As the doors close, Wendy can\u0027t help but notice that the train\u0027s number is \"081\", which, in the reflection of a mirror she is looking at, reads \"180\", the ominous number in the franchise. She is unnerved, but sits down to talk to Julie. As they speak, she notices Kevin riding on the train as well, and goes over to ask why he\u0027s there. As he begins talking, she notices something is wrong as the lights begin to dim. Meanwhile, the rat chews on the candy bar, but gets too close to electricity and fries itself, causing the tracks to switch over. The train then goes haywire, and everyone panics as it flies off the tracks. Julie is obliterated by the train\u0027s wheel, and Kevin is thrown against a cracked window and is unable to move as it slowly begins to grow weaker. The window finally breaks and Kevin is jettisoned outside, screaming as he is violently ground between the train and tunnel wall. Wendy clings onto a pole, screaming, until the train crashes and she is thrown outside. Wendy sees that everyone is dead around her, and she crawls, seeing her leg is severely injured. Wendy begins crying and soon afterwards another train approaches her at full speed. She begins screaming word voice tell \"No!\" and just as the train is about to hit her it is revealed to the be another premonition she had while talking to Kevin - but this time, the premonition has taken place mere seconds before the accident which it depicted word voice tell \"I was gonna look you up afterwards, but You OK Is somethin\u0027 wrong.\" Wendy alarms Kevin and Julie about the train as Kevin grabs the emergency brake along with Julie and Wendy try to pry the door open his Wendy as final last end closing word voice tell \"The train. Oh, shit. Not again. We gotta get out It\u0027s not working. Somebody stop the train\" the lights begin to flash and the final closing last screen cuts to black on heard is the crashing destroy collapse of the subway train earthquake full death kill corpse burial blood and the movie ends, movie closes, film ends to film closes with closing credits to roll with metal horror mystery ghost musician by Tommy Lee provided a cover of The O\u0027Jays 1972 song \"Love Train\" plays, followed by closing musical including instrumental of \"Final Destination 3 Main Theme\" by Shirley Walker.

There he meets Joan (Shirley Anne Field), a 20-year-old girl, who lures him into a mugging staged by her biker brother King (Oliver Reed) and his gang. Wells is beaten up and robbed.Later Joan approaches Wells on his small boat. He is prepared to forgive and forget, she implies that he asked for it after trying to pick her up. At that moment they are threatened by King and his gang. Wells sets off on his boat and calls on Joan to join him which she does, defying her over-protective (and rather incestious) brother.After drifting out to sea, Joan decides to go back and confront King, who has previously locked her into a cupboard when she has come close to other men. King and his gang keep a watch-out for them.At night Wells and Joan return to a quiet part of the mainland and make love in a cliff top house surrounded by curious sculptures. Caught up and surrounded by the gang, the couple escape into a nearby military base where guards and dogs are soon in pursuit of them all.The house was rented by sculptress Freya Neilson (Viveca Lindfors) whose lover, Bernard (Alexander Knox), is a scientist who runs the base. He will not discuss his work, warning her that he \"might be condemning her to death\".Wells and Joan make their way down the cliff face. King goes after them. There they discover a network of caves and bunkers occupied by a small group of young boys and girls, aged about 11. Although well-dressed, cared-for and educated, it is clear that they do not know much about the outside world. The children\u0027s skin is also cold at the touch.In fact the children are confined to the bunker which is the underground part of the military base. The premises, which double as a schoolroom and living quarters, are filled with surveillance cameras. Access to the children is limited though they are occasionally visited by men in radiation suits. Bernard gives them lessons via a TV monitor, but dismisses some of their more searching questions, saying that they will learn the answers \"when the time comes\".The children do not even know much about where they are. One of them actually believes that they are in a spaceship and are to populate a distant planet.The children have a small hideout in a connecting cave where they keep pictures and mementoes of people they think are their parents. They believe that it is a safe and secret place but Bernard and his associates are well aware of it. Bernard, who is, in his own way, genuinely fond of the children, has allowed them this degree of privacy in spite of objections by the head of security Major Holland (Walter Gotell).Time passes and Wells, Joan and King feel increasingly unwell, but Wells and Joan have promised to help the children escape and pressure King into helping them. The children keep them fed by ably smuggling food pass the surveillance cameras into the hideout.Since security has been unable to find the intruders, Bernard tells the children via the TV monitor that he knows their secret and asks that they give up the grown-ups that they are hiding there. He reminds them of a rabbit they once acquired as a pet but which later died and warns them that the same might happen to their would-be rescuers. The children rebel and destroy the cameras.Men in radiation suits then enter the premises but are overpowered and even killed by Wells and King. Using a Geiger counter, Wells discovers that it is in fact the children themselves who are radioactive. Nevertheless he agrees to break them out. They escape the bunker and face the world, the Sun and flowers for the first time.But before they can take it all in, they are rounded up and, kicking and screaming, are taken back to the bunker by other men in radiation suits. Freya Neilson, the sculptress, witnesses the events.King drives off in a sports car accompanied by Henry (Kit Williams), one of the children. Weakened by the radioactivity, King orders Henry out of the car saying that he is \"poison\". Henry is then grabbed by pursuers and forcibly taken back to the bunker in a helicopter.Chased by another helicopter, King crashes his car into a river. Joan and Wells are allowed to leave on his boat, but the sickness catches up with them and the boat goes round and round in the sea monitored by a military helicopter, which will destroy the boat once its occupants are dead.Bernard\u0027s only real regret about the whole affair is that \"his\" children now know for sure that they are \"freaks\" and prisoners and will be more difficult to control. He explains to Neilson that they were radioactive from birth. The plan is to release them \"when the time comes\", i.e. the inevitable nuclear war. Their bodies will resist the nuclear fallout and the human race will continue. Now that Neilson knows his secret, Bernard kills her. (In the 1950s and early 60s, the threat of nuclear war was very real, a matter of \"when\" not \"if\", and culminated in the Cuban Missile Crisis.)The film ends with the children desperately and vainly calling for help from their cliff side prison.","numvotes":"3447","primarytitle":"The Damned","productioncompany":"Hammer Films","countriesoforigin":"United Kingdom","averagerating":"6.6","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"The Damned","sex of artist":"female","storyline":"The middle-aged American Simon Wells sails in his boat to Weymouth and stumbles with the twenty year-old Joan on the street.

The limo stops to pick up a guy (Steve) waiting by a country roadside, they embrace and kiss. Soon the couple arrive at a small church where fans are waiting to greet the singer, who we then see putting on a small christian rock performance. The pastor explains that the couple are going to Scotland for two years to spread the word of Christ. The congregation cheers and claps as they are wished God Speed and when they get back they are to be married.We are then taken to Scotland where we see people making general preparations, as we follow the camera we here the sound of machinery getting louder until the camera stops at a door. Here we can see the outline of a man and a sudden big gush of blood splatters against the window. The man curses and yells and we see he is in some sort of butchering room. Beth amd Steve have arrived and are now being greeted by a reverend. A car pulls up and out steps Sir Lachlan Morrison and his wife Delia, who are the ones that have invited Steve \u0026 Beth to stay. After exchanging greetings Beth \u0026 Steve show them their matching silver rings which symbolise their vow of chastity to each other. As we go into the church Sir Lachlan \u0026 Delia talk amongst themselves about how perfect Beth is. Beth begins to sing to the congregation as Delia goes to speak with Steve, she removes his cowboy hat explaining that hats in church are taboo.We then go to their hotel where Beth and Steve are in her room making out, Steve tries to go further and Beth refuses, when a raunchy pop video comes showing Beth before she was \u0027born again\u0027. Beth is upset and becomes agitated when she can\u0027t turn the TV off. She does, Steve goes to leave when the telephone rings. It is Delia calling to check on them, Steve leaves before she finishes the conversation. The next day we see Beth and Steve traipsing door to door trying to hand out pamphlets - all doors are slammed in their face. Down-hearted, then Delia shows up and invites them to her village, Beth is hesitant but they agree. In the car Delia questions Beth and Steve about their \u0027born again\u0027 views. They pass Tressock Nuclear Power station where they meet Sir Lachlan and travel on to the village. A lady rides up on a horse, they stop \u0026 have a brief chat about a special feast on Sunday and the horse. Villages wait slightly out of sight as they enter the village and drive through. They stop and we are introduced to Jack and his pet bird, he talks jibberish to them and the bird says Nevermore. Steve is puzzled, it is clear that Beth has been whisked off and Sir Lachlan explains that they will be spilt up with Beth staying at the manor and Steve staying in a tavern. He is introduced to the owner and off he goes.Lolly, who we now know was the horse rider, and a policeman go into his station/ house and begin to flirt \u0026 undress. A car pulls up at a large manor house and out steps Sir Lachlan \u0026 Beth. Back to Steve at pub, he is talking with Jack \u0026 some other locals. Declines to play cards as he doesn\u0027t gamble, but reads the cars and begins to preach something to do with God about every card he picks out. Someone begins to sing and that merges with a females singing same song as Beth walks into the room and meets some girls sewing the May Queen dress, Beth is asked if she would like to see it \u0026 try it on, she does, they sing and she is asked if she would be their May Queen.We then cut to Lolly \u0026 the policeman having sex \u0026 talking. Then we are back at the tavern where a middle age lady is playing piano \u0026 singing, Steve goes upstairs to bed and is woken later by a Raven on window sill, he jumps and is woken by Sir Lachlan in his Porsche outside inviting Steve to take his horse Prince for a ride to explore. He does and very soon comes across Lolly in the river naked, he stops, they chat, Lolly invites him into the water - after being a little hesistant, he does, they talk some more and Lolly mentioned that Beth is going to be asked to be May Queen and they want him to be the Laddie, she explains what that means becoming more suggestive and then they have sex despite his vow to be celibate until marriage. Afterwards they talk on the bank of the river, He gets up, dressed and realises he has lost his silver ring in the water.Then we see Sir Lachlan and some others in a meeting about living near their Nuclear Power Station this continues outside in car where it is hinted at a Nuclear accident infiltrating the water and all are now infertile, so no babies. Beth \u0026 Steve are in the church preaching to Sir Lachlan and the villagers, Beth begins to sing as Steve passes out pamphlets as the song carries on the villagers begin to join in. Outside is a buffet spread where we see Jack and his bird (Raven), Lolly comes up to him and they chat, she then goes to the church window watching Steve as he walks through the villagers. After this they are taken across the river in a boat to a lodge, and left alone. Steve doesn\u0027t talk, Beth becomes concerned and asks whats wrong. He basically says that he will be there for the May Queen crowning the next day, but he is leaving after and returning to Texas as he is a sinner. He goes off with Sir Lachlan to practice what to do next day as Laddie, Sir Lachlan is walking through the woods with Steve telling him what to do, not to listen to anything anyone says and get to a castle ruin where there is a throne he must sit on and wait for everyone else to arrive. Beth is upset at the lodge and begins to listen to her old raunchier song, but then slams it off and regains composure. Back at the tavern Steve is asked for his autogragh by a young boy, Steve mentions there are no other children around and asks why, however the Landlord comes out and tells the boy to get off home and stop bothering Steve. At the Manor Beth is dressed up in a glamourous formal evening dress as tells Delia she\u0027s mad with Steve and plans to enjoy herself. Then montage of Steve looking sorry for himself and Beth at the dinner party dancing with someone in a kilt. Then the evening party are singing around the piano, later on Beth is ready for bed in her room saying her prayers, there is a knock at the door and it is the butler (Beame) bringing her some hot milk. There is a cat in her room which Beame tries to chase out but Beth insists it stays. Beth goes to sleep and the cat drinks \u0026 knocks over milk. Then cut to the policeman \u0026 Lolly having sex again, Jack and another villager stand outside laughing at the noise and we cut to an ambulance rushing off. The next morning the cat is dead on the floor when Delia enters, Beth is asleep. Delia picks up the cat and takes it downstairs to Lachlan and shows him the dead cat. Beame is told to deal with Beth after breaksfast and get her ready. Delia \u0026 Lachlan talk about their religious beliefs, he looks at a portait on the wall and we are shown a flashback of him and his Grandfather (Christopher Lee) by the river talking about the Laddie and fate. Delia and Lachlan finish talking and the hunt for the Laddie begins. Beame (wearing traditional kilt) is climbing the stairs carrying a needle, he enters Beths room, but she wakes up as he approaches, she see the needle and struggles picking up some of the broken glass and stabbing in his testicles, he yells and she runs away knocking over the cook, through the house and outside. The hunt continues while Beame is having his injury seen to by the cook and they discuss where she\u0027d go. The hunt is still going and Steve is making good headway until his stirrup breaks (having been cut) making him fall from the horse. He gets up and begins to ride away, but Lolly has caught up and is calling to him. We see Beth running down a deserted road where she comes across Jack. She goes into his house and tries to use the phone but he is too incoherrent to help her. Suddenly Beame walks in, grabs her and takes her away. Lolly tels Steve it\u0027s a trap and to follow her, but he thinks it\u0027s just a so he ignores her. Steve arrives at the Castle just as the others are catching up. Beth is laid out face down, unconcious and naked on the kitchen table being brushed with oil by Cook. Beame, the cook and another villager (Mary?) talk amongst themselves about Beth and why she is being brushed in oil as the conversation carries on it is apparent that Sir Lachlan intends to eat her raw. Cook says she is sedated as Lachlan like them to be fresh as possible, then Beame gets upset as somebody has been messing with his collection of May Queen eyes. Steve is just getting to the castle, and Beth is being put in a store room still unconcious on a table. She begins to wake up and looks around. In the meantime Lanchlan and the other villagers enter the Castle where Steve is sitting on the throne as he was told. Steve is cocky at first, but starts to lose his bravado as the villagers surround the throne. As this is going on Beth puts on the May Queen dress and explores her surroundings. Lachlan begins to talk as the villagers start to strip off. Beth sees what appears to be statues of previous May Queens, but it starts to become apparent to her that they are not what they seem and she calls out. Lachlan and the villagers start to sing as the continue to strip in front of a confused Steve who doesn\u0027t seem to realise what is going on, suddenly realisation dawns as Lachlan begins to give praise to the Sun as the villagers descend. It is too late as the villagers grab Steve and begin to eat him alive, Lolly is outside sobbing and we see the villagers dancing and feasting in praise.As Beth looks at the statues, the Cook is listening to the radio and rather drunk, you can hear Beth calling and banging to be let out. Delia is seen after bathing Steves blood off and hears Beth yelling. Beth touches a statue and the outside cracks away revealing a skeletal hand underneath, she runs for a door that leads her outside, it\u0027s locked but she manages to escape through a window. She runs and bumps into Lolly, who tells her Steve is dead, Beth can\u0027t beleive it and Lolly tries to get her to go away with her she refuses even though Lolly makes it clear to her that she will be killed. Beth walks on up a hill to where the Wicker Tree stands, Lachlan is singing as the villagers dance around in praise. Beth walks through them and them seem not to see her and suddenly Lachlan is made aware that the Queen is there, he looks surprised but begins to explain when she asks about Steve. She asks Danny (a villager) who confirms he is dead, very quickly as Lachlan continues to talk Beth shoves him into the Wicker Tree where he burns alive. She tells the villagers to sing, they join in and then disperse back to the village. Beth is left alone and trying to find a way out of the village when she comes across the little boy who offers to lead to the next village. As they walk, the villagers start to appear behind her. She is suddenly grabbed by them.

That night, a strong wind blows a bottle of water over onto the rock, which begins to bubble and smolder. The next day, the head of the geological office, Dave Miller, returns to town from a business trip and finds the office destroyed by a huge growth of black rock and Ben dead, in a rock-hard, apparently petrified state. Meanwhile, Dave\u0027s girl friend, schoolteacher Cathy Barrett, brings her students to the desert, where little Ginny Simpson pockets a piece of the black rock, later washing it in a basin outside her parents\u0027 farm. In town, Doctor Reynolds performs an autopsy on Ben, but when he cannot explain Ben\u0027s rigidity, he informs Dave and Police Chief Dan Corey that he is shipping the body to a specialist. Martin returns to the demolished office with Dave, and there recognizes the rock formations as resembling the piece of black rock Ben had been examining. Cathy joins them and, also recognizing the rock, races with the men to the Simpson farm. They find it in ruins under a pile of black rock, and Ginny\u0027s parents dead. The girl, however, is in a catatonic state, and they rush her to the care of specialist Dr. Steve Hendricks, at the California Medical Research Center. He soon reports that she is slowly turning to stone, and posits that her only hope of survival lies with identifying the black rock within the next eight hours. Dave brings the rock to his old professor, Arthur Flanders, who assumes that it is from a meteor. Together they visit the Simpson farm, where Arthur notices a discoloration in the ground and deduces that the rock is draining silicon from whatever it touches, including humans. They then go to the desert, where they trace fragments of the rock to a huge meteor. Fretting that the meteor contains billions of years worth of space secrets, which they have only hours to discover, Dave sends the new information to Steve, who prepares a synthetic silicon solution and injects it into Ginny. While a storm brews outside, Dave and Arthur continue to investigate what causes the rock to grow, and after a piece of rock falls into the sink and begins to bubble, they realize that water is the culprit. Noticing the rain, they drive to the desert, where the small pieces of rock are mixing with water to form huge monoliths that rise from the earth and then crash into hundreds of pieces, each becoming another monolith. They report their findings to Dan, who plans to evacuate the town, even though the weather bureau reports that the rain will soon stop. At the hospital, Ginny finally stirs, and Dave deduces that Steve\u0027s silicon solution can be used to control the rocks. Soon, however, more locals are rushed to hospital in the throes of the petrification process, and the rock continues to grow. With little time to announce their findings to the town, Dave and Dan turn to Martin to round up the paperboys and spread the word. The governor soon declares a state of emergency, and Dave and Arthur struggle to convert the formula to one that will retard the rock growth, failing until they realize that the key lies in the simple saline solution Steve used on Ginny. While casualties mount, Dave figures out a way to dynamite the local dam and flood the nearby salt flats, thus creating a large supply of salty water near the canyon edge. Knowing that they must halt the rock\u0027s growth at the canyon edge or lose all hope of survival, Dave ignores the governor\u0027s refusal to give permission to the risky project, and sets up dynamite stations around the dam. Arthur doubts that the water will be able to absorb enough salt for the plan to work, but Martin cites hopeful statistics he has learned from years of reporting on the salt flats, and the team is cheered by his certainty. With only minutes left until the monoliths reach the canyon edge, Dan orders the dynamite to be detonated, and the group watches in fear as the water flows over the monoliths. The plan at first seems to fail, but finally the rock growth slows, and Dan holds Cathy as the last huge formation crashes to a standstill.","numvotes":"3150","primarytitle":"The Monolith Monsters"},"color":"rgb(92,73,83)","size":1.0},{"source":"Sci-Fi","target":"tt0050280","id":"7228","attributes":{"notes":"Mad scientist elements; adaptation","runtimeminutes":"82","sex of killer":"male","synopsis":"The movie opens with text over a red background that reads, \"More than a hundred years ago, in a mountain village in Switzerland, lived a man whose strange experiments with the dead have since become legend. The legend is still told with horror the world over...It is the legend of...\" A clever segway into the title: The Curse of Frankenstein. Credits follow.A man on horseback approaches a prison in the mountains along a narrow pathway. A church bell chimes the hour as a man opens the gate for the rider. He is a priest (Alex Gallier). He is escorted by the Warder (Michael Mulcaster) to see Baron Victor Frankenstein (Peter Cushing). The warder explains that the prisoner is dangerous. The Baron wishes to see the priest because he thinks he can trust the man with his story. He starts his story, \"I suppose it was when I was a boy at school. I always had a brilliant intellect. When my mother died, I inherited the Frankenstein fortune.\"The Young Baron (Melvyn Hayes) is escorting his extended family out of his house after his mother died. His uncle (Raymond Ray) leads the family delegation. Aunt Sophie (Noel Hood) and her daughter, young Elizabeth (Sally Walsh) stay behind. Aunt Sophie wants reassurance her allowance will continue uninterrupted. After confirming the money will continue, Victor quickly escorts the two relatives out the door. As they are leaving, a dapper gentleman in a brown top hat arrives. Paul Krempe (Robert Urquhart) walks into the house and presents himself to the new, but very young, Baron. He had corresponded with the Baron for a tutor. Initially he thinks there must be some mistake or a joke, but Victor explains the tutoring is for himself and he is serious. The two hit it off immediately. After two years, \"I learned all he had to teach, but we went on together probing into the unknown, investigating, recording, searching, always searching until gradually the sweep of our research began to assume a single direction and to this aim we finally turned all our energies. It took us years of unrelenting work to discover what we were seeking.\" With chemical and electrical apparatus they were able to restore life to a dead puppy. Paul sees the possibilities of their discovery. He notes, \"If we could delay or prolong the period in which the body is apparently dead while the heart is alive wed have a living body with only the barest life-spark present. That what that would mean when it came to performing major surgery!\" Paul wants to write up their findings and present it at a medical conference within a month. Victor expresses his opposition because he wants to experiment further and does not want to share the secret, not yet at least. He proposes the next step. Rather than just restore life, he wants to create life from the beginning. He tells Paul, \"We must build up our own creature, and built it up from nothing. We must create a human beinga perfect human.\" Paul disagrees, \"What you\u0027re saying is nonsense, a revolt against nature. Such a thing could only end in evil.\" Victor persuades Paul to continue the work. He proposes to obtain a body, and knows a highwayman was hanged for his crimes and suggests they retrieve it. They take a horse and cart and cut down the body and return it to their lab. Paul notes that half the head has been eaten away. Victor quickly cuts the head off, explaining it is of no use. He dumps it into a vat of acid in the storage room next door. They remove the old clothes, wrap the body in bandages and place it in a large, glass tank. Now Paul voices his objection to the whole exercise, \"I don\u0027t think we should continue with this.\" Victor tells Paul he will be leaving for a while but does not explain where or why.Justine the maid (Valerie Gaunt) carries refreshments into the living room and asks Paul if the Baron has returned. She answers the door, expecting that Victor has returned. To her disappointment it is not the Baron but a woman who tells her she was expected and needs help with her luggage. Elizabeth (Hazel Court) is the Baron\u0027s cousin and we learn later his fiancée. She mistakes Paul for the Baron. Victor arrives home in an excited state calling for Paul. He is not surprised to see Elizabeth. He and Paul rush off to the lab upstairs leaving Elizabeth annoyed and confused.Victor unwraps something from a small black bag. He proudly displays two hands, cut off at the wrist. He explains they are Bardello\u0027s hands--the hands of the world\u0027s greatest sculptor. Paul voices his objection to exposing Elizabeth to the experiment. He tells Victor, \"While you were away, I decided I could not continue with this experiment.\" He tries to convince Victor to stop, but he is unsuccessful. Victor remains in the lab and will graft the new hands on by himself. Paul goes downstairs and tries to convince Elizabeth to leave. In this he is also unsuccessful, mainly because he will not explain the nature of the experiment or the danger. She explains she is to be Victor\u0027s wife.Outside the lab, Victor and Justine embrace and kiss. Victor is just toying with the maid. She believes she will be his wife, but Victor tells her that Elizabeth is to be his wife. The next morning Victor prepares to leave on another trip. Elizabeth talks to him about the household accounts and possibly assisting in other ways. Victor pays a visit to the Municipal Charnel House and buys a pair of human eyes. Victor takes them home to examine them when Paul asks to see him. He reiterates his refusal to help Victor with his work. Victor proudly shows Paul how far he has gone on his own. Paul turns away from the tank with revulsion and exclaims, \"It\u0027s horrible!\" Victor tells Paul that once a genius brain is obtained and installed the creature will take on a benevolent face. When asked where the brain will come from, Victor replies, \"I\u0027ll get it.\"Victor and Elizabeth are in the living room entertaining a visitor. Professor Bernstein (Paul Hardtmuth) accepted an invitation from the Baron for dinner and to spend the night. The professor tells Victor that discoveries can be mishandled. Paul enters the room and is introduced to the distinguished professor. Victor escorts the old man upstairs to his room. At the top of the stairs Victor shows him a painting, maneuvering the old man closer to the bannister, which gives way. Victor pushes the old man through and down to his death. Professor Bernstein is given a burial at the Baron\u0027s expense and in his family vault. Later that evening the Baron retrieves Bernstein\u0027s brain. He carefully places the jar in his bag and prepares to leave the vault. Paul arrives, expecting to find Victor and accuses him of murder. Paul intends to stop Victor from using the brain, and tells him so. They briefly struggle over the bag and the jar is broken.Paul calls on Elizabeth in her room and again begs her to leave. He explains he only stays to ensure her safety. In the lab, Victor is picking pieces of glass out of the brain, trying to salvage it. He puts the brain into the skull and prepares to revive his newly finished creature. He starts the chemical and electrical equipment as an electrical storm brews outside. Paul is upstairs in his room preparing for bed. As the tank empties, Victor goes to Paul\u0027s room and again asks for help. He admits, \"That apparatus was constructed for dual operation. You know that. I thought I could work it myself, but I can\u0027t.\" But Paul gleefully replies, \"I\u0027m delighted.\" A lightning bolt starts the electrical components and the body in the empty tank begins to breathe. Victor promises that after the experiment is completed he will dispose of the body. Paul reluctantly agrees to help. Victor returns to the lab and hears glass breaking. He unlocks the lab door and standing there is the creature. It pulls away the bandages covering its head to reveal a scarred and hideous face (Christopher Lee). One eye is blue, the other brown, and it stares at its creator with hate. It grabs Victor and chokes him. Only Paul\u0027s quick action saves Victor. He breaks a chair over the thing\u0027s head. The creature stumbles and falls to the floor. Paul demands the creature be destroyed as Victor straps it down to a table. Victor tells Paul he will operate on the brain the next morning and try to correct its homicidal tendencies. But the next morning the lab is a shambles and the window broken. The creature has broken free and escaped.Victor and Paul search the countryside for the creature. An old blind man (Fred Johnson) and his grandson (Claude Kingston) are out in the woods for a stroll. The old man sits and the grandson goes down to the lake shore to pick mushrooms. The creature encounters the old man. After a brief exchange he kills the old man. The grandson returns to where he left his grandfather. Victor and Paul find signs and follow it into the woods. They find it, and Paul shoots the creature through the eye. The creature falls and is pronounced dead. They bury it in place and return to the house.Paul goes to the lab and tells Victor he is leaving. With the creature dead, he no longer needs to stay and protect Elizabeth. But Paul doesn\u0027t know Victor dug his creation up and returned its lifeless body back to the lab. Victor stares at his creature hanging in the store room and promises, \"I\u0027ll give you life again.\" Victor is dressed and tells Justine she can serve dinner. Justine reminds Victor of his promise to marry her. Her trump card is the revelation she is pregnant with his child. He does not believe he is the father, but Justine informs the master that Elizabeth will believe her. She adds that she will go to the authorities regarding the experiment. He fires the maid and orders that she leave the next morning. That night Justine goes up to the lab to get the proof she will need for the authorities. Victor leaves the lab door unlocked and Justine enters for a look. She enters the storage room and finds the revived creature. When she tries to flee, Victor locks her in, knowing his homicidal creation will kill her. It does.A week later, Victor and Elizabeth are having breakfast. Elizabeth inquires about Justine. Victor lies and tells her, \"I expect some village lothario eloped with her.\" They discuss the wedding plans. Elizabeth reveals she invited Paul. Instead of being angry, Victor casually informs her he hopes Paul comes. He says that he has something to show Paul.It is the eve of the wedding, and a reception at the Baron\u0027s home is underway. The Burgomaster (Andrew Leigh) is enjoying the laced punch and practicing his speech. His wife (Ann Blake) reproaches her drunk husband and they leave for home. When all the guests have left, Victor announces he will be working in the lab. Elizabeth is disappointed and tells her future husband. Paul does not attend the reception, but does come later that evening. Elizabeth tells Paul to go surprise Victor. Victor is preparing a plate of flood when Paul knocks on the lab door. Victor invites his old tutor into the lab. He leads him to the storage room. Paul is shocked to discover the creature chained to the wall and showing signs of brain surgery. Victor orders the creature onto its feet. It struggles but stands, then sits when ordered. Paul chides the Baron about the creature\u0027s lack of perfection, but Victor reminds Paul, \"There you see the result of your handiwork as much as mine...but you damaged it. You put a bullet in the wretched thing. This is your fault, Paul.\" Paul exits the lab, promising to go to the authorities and have them destroy the creature. Victor chases after him. He leaves the lab door unlocked and Elizabeth enters the lab. The creature breaks its chains. Elizabeth enters the storage room and sees the vat of acid. The creature gets out onto the roof. Victor and Paul see it and Paul goes to the village for help. Elizabeth goes outside to explore a noise she heard. Victor grabs a pistol and goes out to the roof. Firing at the creature he hits Elizabeth, then the creature. Only wounded, the creature approaches Victor. A well-aimed toss of an oil lamp sets the creature ablaze. The creature falls through the skylight and straight into the acid filled vat below.We return to the prison, and the priest still listening to the story now finished. Victor concludes, \"My life\u0027s work destroyed. Destroyed in a moment. And by the same hand that gave it life.\" Paul comes to visit Victor at the prison. Elizabeth was only wounded and recovers. She is also at the prison, but stays in the waiting area. Victor begs Paul to tell the priest about the creature and to verify the story, but Paul denies it. He does accuse Victor of murdering Justine. Victor claims it was the creature who murdered the maid. The priest leaves the cell. Victor tries to kill Paul, but the jailer prevents it. Paul leaves the cell and returns to talk to Elizabeth. He takes her home. Victor is led to his execution.

Elsewhere, Bernard Wong pays his workers extra money to continue digging his land after discovering human bones. The thugs are members of the Black Ninja Clan, whose dead are buried on Wong\u0027s site. One of their operatives strangles Gordon\u0027s girlfriend, believing she knows where Gordon has hidden the Golden Ninja statue that apparently gives him power and won\u0027t say, while another hires Ghost Ninja, a beautiful witch dressed in white to kill Wong, his daughter Fanny, her husband George, and her son, Bobo, for three million dollars. Fanny is frightened by a cat in the house upon move-in, and the Black Ninja leader keeps swinging her sword to hallucinate frogs jumping to their deaths out of her refrigerator and her soup ladle turning into a flying snake (strung on a wire that is highly visible without pausing despite being a split-second shot). The witch keeps spooking Fanny and Bobo, who insists on riding his bike in the living room, but George doesn\u0027t believe either of them. Gordon (sitting in front of a poster of a strangled woman marked \"this could happen to you\" and another poster of a swimsuit model) responds to their complaints (in shot-reverse shot, as they\u0027re obviously not in the same film) and commands Magic Chan, a wizard with a magic mirror he has forgotten, and his obese sidekick, Firecracker, in the same manor, and frequently keeps in touch on the phone after his Caucasian operative living next door, Sara, is murdered by a zombie man. Sometimes he uses a black phone, but more often it is a Garfield phone (which the camera moves and music suggest is supposed to be funny). The Ghost Ninja is more interested in her own desires than killing the family, and masturbates to the couple\u0027s lovemaking before spiriting herself into Fanny\u0027s vagina (there is no full-frontal nudity) in order to lure George away from her, though she makes him physically ill, as she did to Bobo by stuffing his mouth full of handfuls of grass.

It is meant to look like a suicide.At their boarding house Sue Allen (Phyllis Kirk) is helping Cathy get dressed for her evening out. Cathy expresses no sorrow for Burke, as she has found a new sugar daddy. Mrs. Flannigan (Riza Royce) confronts Sue upon her return from a job interview to get her back rent. Sue goes up to her room to get some money from Cathy. Cathy is dead and Jarrod is there in the room. She screams which brings the household upstairs. Sue leaves through an open window out onto the roof. Jarrod chases her down the street. She manages to slip him and calls for help at a house of an old friend. Mrs. Andrews (Angela Clarke) and her son Scott Andrews (Paul Picerni) bring her inside and she tells them Cathy was murdered and she saw the horrible visage of the murderer.The police investigate the murder at the rooming house. Lt. Tom Brennan (Frank Lovejoy) is lead and he is assisted by Sgt. Jim Shane (Dabbs Greer). The coroner (Frank Ferguson) determines Cathy\u0027s cause of death was strangulation. The surgeon (Grandon Rhodes) adds that she was drugged. Her body is taken to the morgue storage room where Jarrod is waiting under a sheet pretending to be a corpse. He\u0027s there to steal Cathy\u0027s body. With two accomplices below, he lowers her body out of a window with rope into a waiting hearse.The next morning, Mrs. Andrews, Scott and Sue come to the police station to give her report. Lt. Brennan tells them Cathy\u0027s body was stolen from the morgue. Before that, Mathew Burke\u0027s body and a few others were stolen from the morgue. He tells Sue not to leave town, but she is free to leave.Sidney Wallace is back in New York. He stops at a shop and is greeted by Igor (Charles Buchinsky/Bronson), a deaf-mute, and is escorted inside. Jarrod, looking as he did before the fire, greets Wallace sitting in a wheelchair. He tells Wallace he\u0027s rebuilding his exhibition from the ground up and will give the public what it wants, \"sensation, horror, shock.\" He adds, \"Crimes of violence will be reproduced in wax and exhibited while they are still fresh in the public mind.\" He is searching for a model for his new Marie Antoinette. He shows Wallace the basement with the wax body dip machinery. He asks Wallace to invest. He needs $30,000.The House of Wax opens for its debut. A man exits the lobby to work the crowd. The Barker (Reggie Rymal) has two paddle ball games. (Note: This was originally released as a Color 3-D movie.) He works the crowd into a frenzy by knocking things with the balls on the elastic. Jarrod greets Wallace and escorts him into the museum. He gives him the tour, along with some paying customers.Scott Andrews accompanies Sue on a tour of the Wax Museum. Wallace sees and recognizes Scott--he has been sponsoring him as a talented sculptor. Wallace wants to introduce Scott to Jarrod. While Sue wanders around she is surprised to see a Joan of Arc wax figure that looks exactly like her friend Cathy Gray. She climbs up on the tableaux to get a closer look. Jarrod sees this and approaches in his wheelchair. Sue asks, \"But why should it be so like Cathy?\" Jarrod responds, \"I think I can explain that.\" He tells her that he copied her face from newspaper clippings. Jarrod offers Scott a job, then tells Wallace he sees Marie Antoinette as Sue.Jarrod, without his makeup, goes to see Sue. He spies on her through her open window. She goes to bed. Jarrod steals into her room, but Sue wakes up and screams. Jarrod departs as Mrs. Andrews comes into her room to comfort her.Sue and Scott are at a Can-Can show having lunch. She is convinced there is something wrong about the Joan of Arc figure. Cathy had one ear pierced as does the wax figure. Such detail seems inconceivable. Scott tells Sue they\u0027ll talk to Lt. Brennan. Brennan listens to the story. To humor her, he agrees that the Police will investigate. He does confirm that someone matching Jarrod\u0027s description (with makeup) did ask to look at the photographs of Cathy\u0027s body. Brennan tells Sgt. Shane to check on Jarrod and his employees. They visit the Museum and examine the Joan of Arc. Sue stops by and climbs up on the wax figure again to touch the face. Jarrod catches her again. Jarrod shows Sue a wax head of herself. He tells her he needs her to model for his Marie Antoinette. Before Brennan and Shane leave, they notice some of the wax figures resemble people who have recently died. Shane also thinks he recognizes one of Jarrod\u0027s sculptors, Leon Averill (Nedrick Young).Wallace was waiting outside Brennan\u0027s office for Brennan and Shane to return. They arrive and ask him some questions about Jarrod. Before he leaves he vouches for Jarrod. Shane then remembers Leon as an artist imprisoned at Sing-Sing. He was then known as Hendricks and was an alcoholic. Brennan tells Shane to bring him in. They search his belongings at the station and find a watch that belonged to one of the bodies stolen from the morgue. Brennan tells Shane to book him on suspicion of murder.Jarrod sends Scott on an errand after he tells Jarrod Sue will be stopping by later. Sue enters the darkened Museum. Igor locks her in then follows her as she wanders around looking for Scott. She is drawn to the Joan of Arc and climbs back on the tableaux. She pulls back the black wig and finds Cathy\u0027s blond hair beneath. Jarrod tells her, \"You shouldn\u0027t have done that, my dear.\" Sue tells Jarrod, \"It\u0027s Cathy\u0027s body under the wax. I knew it. I knew it all the time.\" Jarrod gets up out of the wheelchair and walks towards her. She runs straight into Igor. She hits Jarrod about the head and his wax face breaks off revealing the scarred face below. She is taken to the basement where Jarrod fires up his wax machine.At police headquarters they are questioning Leon with alcohol as a bribe. He spills his guts and tells the police, \"The whole place is a morgue.\" The police race over to the House of Wax. Sue is shackled in a box with the hot wax shower threatening. Scott returns to the museum looking for Sue. Igor blocks the door to the workshop and he and Igor fight. Scott is knocked out. Igor places his body on the guillotine, but before he can operate the machine the police stop him. The police break down the door to the cellar. They fight with Jarrod on the bridge above the boiling vat of wax. Jarrod is knocked into the liquid and dies. Brennan moves the box Sue is shackled into away from the hot wax as the machinery explodes.The next morning Scott, Sue, Brennan and Shane meet in Brennan\u0027s office. We close with Brennan holding up the wax head of Igor.","numvotes":"17867","primarytitle":"House of Wax","productioncompany":"Bryan Foy Productions","countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"7.0","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"House of Wax","sex of artist":"male","storyline":"Professor Henry Jarrod is a true artist whose wax sculptures are lifelike.

Merrin is also an ordained Roman Catholic priest who, still haunted by what he was forced to do during World War II in his native Holland, eschews any religion or belief. He\u0027s fascinated by what he finds and that it dates hundred of years before Christianity was introduced to the area. Accompanied by a young priest, Father Francis, to keep an eye on the religious elements of what they find, Merrin makes his way to the camp. There he meets a young doctor, Sarah and soon realizes there is an air of gloom that envelops the entire site. Workmen go mad and a young boy is mauled by a pack of hyenas while completely ignoring his younger brother Joseph. Inside the church itself they find signs of desecration. Merrin is forced to re-examine his lack of faith and come face to face with the devil. —garykmcd","startyear":"2004","runtimeminutes":"114","sex of killer":"unhuman","synopsis":"The plot revolves around the crisis of faith suffered by Father Lankester Merrin following the horrific events he witnessed during World War II. Many years before the events in The Exorcist, the young Father Merrin (played by Skarsgård, who played the same part in Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist) travels to East Africa. Merrin has taken a sabbatical from the Church and devoted himself to history and archaeology as he struggles with his shattered faith. He is haunted especially by an incident in a small village in occupied Holland during World War II, where he served as parish priest: near the end of the war, a sadistic Nazi SS commander, in retaliation for the murder of a German trooper, forces Merrin to participate in arbitrary executions in order to save a full village from slaughter.After World War II, Merrin is an archaeologist in Cairo, when he is approached by a collector of antiquities who asks him to come to a British excavation in the Turkana region of Kenya. This dig is excavating a Christian Byzantine church built circa 500 A.D. long before Christianity had reached that region of Africa. The collector asks Merrin to recover an ancient relic of a demon before the British can find it. Merrin agrees and travels to the dig site. He is joined by Father Francis, a Vatican scholar who was on his way to do missionary work in East Africa but was diverted by the Vatican to ensure the church is not desecrated. Upon arriving at the site, Merrin meets Major Granville, the British military officer in charge of the dig. Merrin also meets the chief excavator, a brutish man with visible boils on his face. And he meets Sarah, a doctor who spent time in a concentration camp during World War II and is haunted by what happened to her there. Merrin\u0027s translator and guide is Chuma. In addition, Merrin learns that the diggers are disappearing or leaving in droves because the local tribemen fear the church is cursed. Merrin witnesses a digger inexplicably experience a seizure.Merrin visits the dig site. Only the dome is uncovered; the rest of the church is buried beneath the earth. Merrin discovers that the church is in perfect condition, as though it had been buried immediately after its construction were completed. Merrin, Francis, and Chuma enter the church through the dome. They find it is near-pristine condition, but there are two oddities. First, all of the statues of the angels holding weapons are pointing the spears downward, whereas it is conventional for statues of angels to either have no weapons or to point them triumphantly toward heaven. Merrin and Francis deduce the sculptors were trying to depict the angels restraining something that was beneath the church. The second disturbing discovery is that someone has vandalized the church by ripping the enormous crucifix from its place on the altar and suspending it with Christ on the cross in an upside-down position, which is considered a desecration.Merrin is determined to learn more about the archeological dig and asks to consult with the lead archeologist, Monsieur Bession. Sarah tells Merrin that Bession went insane three weeks earlier and was transferred to a mental hospital in Nairobi. Merrin visits Bession\u0027s tent at the dig site and sees dozens of drawings of the same thing, the demon artifact the collector had asked Merrin to find. Merrin then travels to Nairobi to visit Bession. But when he enters Bession\u0027s room, he discovers Bession has carved a swastika on his chest and is speaking through demonic possession in the voice of the sadistic SS commander who tormented Merrin during the war. As Merrin registers these events, Bession slashes his own throat after saying he was \"free.\" Father Gionetti, warden of the asylum, speculates that Bession was not possessed but rather \"touched\" by a demon, which drove him mad and eventually to suicide. Merrin is very skeptical, but before he returns to the dig site, Father Gionetti gives him the volume of Roman rituals to use in exorcism, although Merrin claims he will never use them.Upon returning to the village, strange events continue. A local boy is attacked and killed by hyenas that seem to continuously stalk the dig, night and day. His younger brother, Joseph, enters a fugue state after watching his brother ripped to pieces. Merrin begins to suspect that something evil lies in the church and is infecting the region. There are stories of an epidemic that wiped out an entire village. However, when Merrin, growing suspicious of these rumors, digs up one of the graves of the supposed victims of this plague, he discovers it is empty. Meanwhile, the evil grows, turning people against each other and resulting in violence, atrocities, and more bloodshed.Father Francis reveals to Merrin that the builders of the church never meant it to be recorded in Vatican documents, however, a vague reference to it was recorded, leading to its subsequent discoveries in the 19th and 20th centuries. Francis also reveals that the church stands on the supposed site where Satan fell to earth after the war in heaven, and it was constructed by early Christians in an attempt to purify the evil that resides there.Beneath the church lies the ruins of an even older temple but not a Christian one. Rather, in the ruins under the church, Merrin and his allies find demonic icons, and other signs of evil and Satanism. This land is where he first encounters the demon that calls itself Pazuzu, which he will encounter again in The Exorcist. This is the demon that \"brushed\" Bession (driving him insane) and Joseph (making him ill).At the end of the movie, the dig\u0027s doctor, Sarah, turns out to be the possessed individual and has the demon exorcised from her in the tunnels below the church but dies. Dr. Merrin and Joseph emerge from the church, (once again buried in sand) and history has repeated itself. 50 (and 1500) years ago, everyone at the site was killed by an evil presence from the church, except for one priest. Now, only Father Merrin and the little boy are left as the British soldiers and the local tribes have annihilated each other. Merrin returns to Rome and meets with the collector at a cafe, explaining he was unable to find the relic, the collector replies, \"But you found something....Didn\u0027t you?\"... As he leaves, Merrin is revealed to be wearing a collar and is now a priest again, having regained his faith in God, after defeating the demon with holy exorcism rituals.","numvotes":"36569","primarytitle":"Exorcist: The Beginning"},"color":"rgb(65,97,106)","size":1.0},{"source":"special connection","target":"tt8430444","id":"6571","attributes":{"productioncompany":"ALMONTAGE Entertainment","countriesoforigin":"Saudi Arabia","averagerating":"7.7","titletype":"short","notes":"Orientalism","originaltitle":"Khasekhemwy","storyline":"A group of employees, trapped in mysterious and eerie situation, solve the mystery of the cursed Pharaoh\u0027s statue whose evil force is haunting them down.","startyear":"2018","runtimeminutes":"21","sex of killer":"unhuman","numvotes":"14","primarytitle":"Khasekhemwy"},"color":"rgb(76,84,86)","size":2.0},{"source":"Mystery","target":"tt0432291","id":"7092","attributes":{"productioncompany":"Revolution Studios","countriesoforigin":"United States, Canada","averagerating":"3.7","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"The Fog","storyline":"The inhabitants of Antonio Island, off the coast of Oregon, are about to unveil a statue honoring the four men (Castle, Wayne, Williams and Malone) who founded their town in 1871.

Alexandra is a sculptress and single mother, Jane is a newly divorced music teacher incapable of having children, and Sukie is an extremely fertile woman with six children and also works as a journalist at the \"Eastwick Word\". Besides an everlasting friendship, these three women share similar misfortunes of being abandoned by their husbands. Not knowing of themselves as being Witches, the women unwittingly form a coven of which consists of weekly get-togethers, during which they drink, play cards, and share their fantasies about ideal men.The day after one such meeting, a mysterious man arrives in the town and immediately stirs up trouble by buying the city\u0027s landmark property, the Lennox mansion. The arrival of this enigmatic stranger causes fascination among the townfolks, all except local townswoman Felicia Alden, the Christian wife of newspaper editor Clyde Alden. Clyde is the boss of Sukie (who Felicia does not like). Although Felicia is not a Witch, she is somehow able to sense that this man, whose name is easily forgotten by everyone, is up to no good. One night, at Jane\u0027s music recital, the man appears and makes a spectacle of himself, which leads to more gossip among the people. After the recital Jane receives flowers and a personal note from the man, signed with the initial \"D\". This then sparks Sukie\u0027s memory, finally revealing the man\u0027s name to be Daryl Van Horne. At the very moment of Sukie remembering his name, her beaded necklace inexplicably breaks and falls to the floor, causing Felicia, who had mocked Daryl\u0027s name, to trip down a large staircase, breaking her leg.Daryl begins to seduce the women one by one, beginning with self-assured Alexandra, who is at first appalled by his arrogance and bravado, but then allows him into her heart. He moves on to Jane, who is seen as being very shy and reserved. Jane explains to Daryl that the home he lives in was once said to be an area where people were burned alive after being accused of witchcraft. Daryl then encourages Jane to stop living a life of doubt and learn to enjoy herself. She takes his advice and begins to act and live recklessly. The next day Daryl invites all three women over to the mansion, which allows him to finally turn his attentions on Sukie. A jealous rivalry emerges between the women, leading to a supernatural game of tennis, where the tennis ball begins to behave oddly--floating, stopping in mid-air--in response to their mood. This shared telekinesis reveals to the women their magical abilities. The women decide to forgo competition and share Daryl, and have the most fun they\u0027ve ever had in their entire lives.Their frequent presence at Daryl\u0027s mansion leads to gossip and rumors spread by Felicia. Alex, Sukie, and Jane become outcasts of the city; the women of Eastwick acknowledge the trio with nasty looks and snotty comments. The Witches begin to have second thoughts on whether or not they should continue to see each other, which then motivates Daryl into causing the girls to unknowingly cast a spell on Felicia, causing her to projectile vomit cherry stones. Felicia is finally killed by husband, who beats her with a fire poker after being horrified when seeing his wife so incredibly ill. Terrified of the dangerous effects of their relationship with Daryl, they agree among each other to never see Daryl or each other for a long period of time. This upsets Daryl, causing him to use his powers against the girls, bringing their worst fears to life. Alex awakens into a bed of snakes, Jane begins to lose her youth transforming into a old woman, and Sukie is forced to feel intense pain. The women reconcile with Daryl in order to get in his good graces again.Realizing that the only way to rid Daryl from their lives is by using Witchcraft against him, the girls trick Daryl into going to town for a while as they practice a banishing spell to make him go away forever. Sukie goes to Daryl\u0027s office and takes a spell book he kept locked in a glass chest. Jane gathered some of Daryl\u0027s personal belongings such as hair, clothing, and pictures of him. Alex created a Voodoo doll out of wax that resembled Daryl. Meanwhile, as Daryl was in town shopping for the girls, he began to feel painful sharp aches in his body from the girls sticking pins and needles into the doll. Daryl becomes infuriated with the girls betrayal, and as he made his way home, Daryl\u0027s devilish figure was beginning to reveal itself more and more.

The summary presented here relays the events in the film, but the manner in which they are presented in the film is equally if not more important that the events themselves. This summary should not be considered an adequate substitute for the experience of actually watching the film.Note: Hungarian names in the film and this summary are in \"Eastern order\" (family name first.)Morosgoványi Vendel (Csaba Czene) is a lowly soldier/orderly stationed at a remote Hungarian farmhouse in WWII. The farmhouse is occupied by Lieutenant Balatony Lajoska (Marc Bischoff), his obese wife (Viktória Kiss), and their two teenage daughters. Morosgoványi lives in a crude shed with pigs and spends much time having sexual fantasies about the young girls, typically while spying on them, masturbating or experimenting with his remarkable ability to shoot flames out of the end of his penis.Following the slaughter of one of the hogs, Morosgoványi is propositioned by Mrs. Balatony who pulls Morosgoványi down upon her in the wooden bathtub containing the pig carcass. They have vigorous and loud sex, with Morosgoványi fantasizing that he\u0027s actually screwing the Balatony daughters. Upon finishing, Morosgoványi falls asleep and it is apparent that he was fantasizing the entire encounter while actually copulating with the dead pig.The next morning, Lt. Balatony kicks open the door to the shed, and shoots the slowly awakening Morosgoványi in the back of the head, blowing his brains out. Mrs Balatony subsequently gives birth to a very large, fat baby. The lieutenant examines the boy lying in the wooden bathtub and discovers a pig-like tail on him. Without speaking a word, he retrieves a pair of pliers from the shed, calmly snips off the tail, and slaps the boy on the rump.Thirty years later Balatony Kálmán (Trócsányi Gergõ) still has his tail stump, and has grown into a hefty professional speed eater. In an stadium full of cheering fans, Kálmán and his friend Miszlényi Béla (Koppány Zoltán) compete for Hungary against the Russian team, shoveling huge spoonfuls of offal and other disgusting material into their mouths in an attempt to finish their enormous helpings first.Narrowly losing the initial round, Kálmán is berated by his uncle/coach for being distracted by Aczél Gizi (Stanczel Adél), the women\u0027s speed-eating champion who is present in the audience and cheering for both him and Béla, who also fancies Gizi. During the break between rounds, Kálmán and Béla trade jibes over Gizi while casually regurgitating the meal they have just gorged themselves.After wiping their mouths off, the competitors face up to the next round - chosen by the Russians to be a giant blob of gelatin/fat with various disgusting animal parts congealed within. Still distracted by Gizi, Kálmán suffers an attack of lock-jaw, and - unable to get the spoon out of his mouth - collapses backwards.Béla visits Kálmán, who is recovering in hospital with an enormous scar on his chest, Gizi by his side. Béla and Gizi blatantly flirt yet Kálmán appears not to mind, instead savoring the drop of sweat that falls onto his face from Gizi\u0027s hairy armpit. At his subsequent wedding to Gizi, Kálmán sings a folorn song about unrequited love while Béla convinces Gizi to \"elope\" with him. The \"elopement\" consists of taking her outside and drunkenly screwing her from behind while she looks through the window at her husband.We next see a sports factory where fat young boys are apprenticed to a government program to develop world-class speed eaters. Seated at an enormous trough of semolina, the stern coach blankets the trough with a few scoops of cocoa powder before starting the boys off on their training. In an office above the factory floor Kálmán is in training and is frustrated. Just at the time when he is attempting his professional comeback from injury, the International Olympic Committee has refused to recognize sport eating. While vomiting into a recycling machine, he complains to his coach.Gizi discovers that she is pregnant. Her and Kálmán\u0027s joy is obvious, but they are concerned by the Communist rules which require pregnant women to be reassigned to a particular factory which would negatively affect her calorie intake and thus her competitiveness in sport eating. They bribe the obstetrician, who gives them a choice between \"cyst\" and \"myeoma\" as a diagnosis which will apparently enable special treatment.While on holidays at the seaside, the famous Kálmán and Gizi are playfully suggesting names for their child when they are \"invited\" aboard the yacht of a visiting Russian dignitary. Before boarding, a flunky explains that they are expected to give a demonstration of their sport. Specifically, this involves eating 45kg of caviar (with a few bacon hocks thrown in) within 20 minutes. Gizi clearly struggles, perhaps concerned for the baby. Beneath decks, Kálmán supports her by reminding her of her previous glories. Back upstairs they are expected to attend dinner, but Gizi is so sick that she passes out face-first onto her plate.Another thirty years pass. We see Balatony Lajoska (Marc Bischoff), - painfully thin - at work at his taxidermy business. Cluttered throughout with various animals, the workshop shows a man who is dedicated to his work. Lajoska leaves his shop and travels to the grocery store where he purchases a huge volume of butter and chocolate. He is obviously smitten by the checkout girl, who ignores his creepy attempts at making eye contact. Lajoska visits the apartment of his father Kálmán, who is now a ridiculously immense naked blob of shapeless flesh. The chocolate bars are for Kálmán, who boasts that by leaving the silver wrappers on he can increase his intake from 400 to 570 per hour. The butter is for Kálmán\u0027s super-sized cats, who lurk menacingly behind iron bars in their porcelain-tiled lair.Kálmán clearly despises his son, partly because of his profession (\"carcass stuffer\") but mostly because he is so skinny. Lajoska endures a barrage of insults from his father as he cleans the house and the cage. Kálmán is too fat to move and even needs his son to change his bedpan for him. Kálmán\u0027s life revolves around his enormous cats and his television, which he swears at while watching his former wife Gizi coaching an American champion speed eater.Back at his taxidermy shop, Lajoska is asked by a dapper businessman for his help regarding a special project. \"Domestic or wild?\" The businessman smirks and admits \"Domestic\". Peering into the customer\u0027s paper bag, Lajoska nods and accepts the work.Again at the grocery store, the same shopping list and the same uncomfortable stare at the checkout. At Kálmán\u0027s apartment, his father needles Lajoska with continued insults. When he calls his son \"cyst\", Lajoska angrily confronts him about how ungrateful he has been. The two get into a terrible argument, throwing chocolate bars at each other. Lajoska storms out suddenly, telling his father he can die for all he cares.Lajoska throws himself into his work. We see extreme closeups of his work under a magnifying class as he prepares various animals for mounting. Back at the grocery store a few days later, Lajoska is buying a small amount of butter and chocolate; the fight with his father was probably the latest in a long series. The female clerk is gone, replaced by a man.At Kálmán\u0027s apartment, Lajoska realizes something is wrong. Having left the cage open after their terrible fight, the cats have attacked and killed Kálmán, chewing a hole into his enormous gut. A string of entrails leads back into the cage where a pair of satisfied cats sit licking their chops.Lajoska embalms his father, stuffing straw into his stomach through the holes the cats gnawed. We next see him strapped standing into an elaborate contraption in the basement of his workshop. Pumps slowly sigh, liquid flows through clear tubes, syringes dive into flesh, and trays of scalpels and other vicious medical instruments move past on articulated arms.With the aid of mirrors, clamps and levers, Lajoska begins the exacting and painstaking work of eviscerating himself. There is no doubt as to his intentions and progress; we are shown in exacting detail scalpels slicing flesh, opening body cavities, removing organs. Lajoska guts himself in front of us.With trembling hands, obviously exhausted from his work, Lajoska finally sews up his own sweating torso. Completing the taxidermy, he pushes a button and we see a razor-sharp blade crank slowly around to the front his neck. After a few calm breaths, the blade is released and via a spring it whips around behind, decapitating Lajoska. A moment later, a saw falls on his right arm, blood gushing as it\u0027s severed just below the shoulder.We cut to the businessman returning to the shop. Unable to locate the proprietor, he goes into the back room and discovers, in the same paper bag, the completed work he requested of Lajoska: a glass globe containing a tiny human fetus. Satisfied, he is about to leave a stack of cash on the bench, when he changes his mind. Venturing further into the shop, he eventually makes his way down to the basement where he discovers Lajoska.We cut immediately to the same businessman at an avant-garde art gallery, lauding the artistic genius of Balatony Lajoska. The glitterati are drinking champagne and eating hors dourves from a porcelain pig.On display in the gallery are two exhibits: firstly: Balatony Kálmán, resplendent in golden tights with a snarl of cat fur protruding from the hole in his magnificent belly, but primarily Balatony Lajoska - minus his head and right arm, standing casually naked with a stitched torso, looking more like a classical Greek statue than a man who mutilated himself.","numvotes":"17441","primarytitle":"Taxidermia","productioncompany":"Amour Fou Vienna","countriesoforigin":"Hungary, Austria, France","averagerating":"6.8","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"Taxidermia","sex of artist":"male","storyline":"Three generations of men, including a pervert that constantly seeks for new kinds of satisfaction, an obese speed eater and a passionate embalmer.","startyear":"2006","role of artist":"killer"},"color":"rgb(117,90,85)","size":3.0},{"source":"Mystery","target":"tt2496400","id":"6608","attributes":{"productioncompany":"Launch Over","countriesoforigin":"United States","averagerating":"5.3","titletype":"movie","originaltitle":"Ten","storyline":"Ten women find themselves in a vacant mansion on Spektor Island in December, 1972. Each believes she\u0027s traveled to the house on business, but they all agree that something seems strange. For one thing, the entire house is full of pictures and statues of pigs. The women all come from drastically different walks of life. None of them would have chosen to spend the night together in such an eerie place, but the last ferry for the mainland has just left, and a terrible storm is rolling in. Trying to make the best of an unpleasant situation, they raid the mansion\u0027s wine cellar and throw a party. As the night creeps on, however, it becomes clear that someone--or something--has lied to get them in the house. It\u0027s not long before someone mentions that Spektor Island is supposed to be haunted. Of course, no one in the house believes in ghosts. At least, not until the first murder. What do an actress, a religious zealot, a renegade, a coed, a model, a singer, a medium, a real-estate investor, a historian, and a doctor have in common? None of them is who they seem. Yet, the fate of the entire world may rest in their hands. —Anonymous","startyear":"2014","runtimeminutes":"83","numvotes":"817","primarytitle":"Ten"},"color":"rgb(102,84,106)","size":2.0},{"source":"comes to life","target":"tt0165297","id":"6937","attributes":{"productioncompany":"Waken Productions","countriesoforigin":"Spain","averagerating":"7.0","titletype":"short","originaltitle":"Genesis","sex of artist":"male","storyline":"A sculptor is traumatized by the death of his wife in a car accident.
